percentfedupcom  talk about covering your ass loretta lynch did just that when she plead the fifth to avoid incriminating herself over payments to irancorrupt to the core attorney general loretta lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of congress about the obama administrations secret efforts to send iran  billion in cash earlier this year prompting accusations that lynch has pleaded the fifth amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the washington free beacon 
sen marco rubio r fla and rep mike pompeo r kan initially presented lynch in october with a series of questions about how the cash payment to iran was approved and delivered 
in an oct  response assistant attorney general peter kadzik responded on lynchs behalf refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several american hostages from iran 
the response from the attorney generals office is unacceptable and provides evidence that lynch has chosen to essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding herrole in providing cash to the worlds foremost state sponsor of terrorism rubio and pompeo wrote on friday in a followup letter to lynch more related",2016-10-29
2,breaking weiner cooperating with fbi on hillary email investigation,"red state  
fox news sunday reported this morning that anthony weiner is cooperating with the fbi which has reopened yes lefties reopened the investigation into hillary clintons classified emails watch as chris wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show 
and the news is breaking while were on the air our colleague bret baier has just sent us an email saying he has two sources who say that anthony weiner who also had coownership of that laptop with his estranged wife huma abedin is cooperating with the fbi investigation had given them the laptop so therefore they didnt need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop pretty interesting development 
targets of federal investigations will often cooperate hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing given weiners wellknown penchant for lying its hard to believe that a prosecutor would give weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence but cooperation can take many forms  and as wallace indicated on this mornings show one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow   the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway well see if weiners cooperation extends beyond that more related",2016-10-30

6,breaking nypd ready to make arrests in weiner casehillary visited pedophile island at least  timesmoney laundering underage sex payforplayproof of inappropriate handling classified information  percentfedupcom,"breaking nypd ready to make arrests in weiner casehillary visited pedophile island at least  timesmoney laundering underage sex payforplayproof of inappropriate handling classified information blackwater usa founder retired navy seal erik prince 
prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why fbi director james comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into clintons email server last week 
because of weinergate and the sexting scandal the nypd started investigating it through a subpoena through a warrant they searched his laptop and sure enough found those  emails they found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing prince claimed 
they found state department emails they found a lot of other really damning criminal information including money laundering including the fact that hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile jeffrey epstein bill clinton went there more than  times hillary clinton went there at least six times he said 
the amount of garbage that they found in these emails of criminal activity by hillary by her immediate circle and even by other democratic members of congress was so disgusting they gave it to the fbi and they said were going to go public with this if you dont reopen the investigation and you dont do the right thing with timely indictments prince explained 
i believe  i know and this is from a very wellplaced source of mine at pp one police plaza in new york  the nypd wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation and theyve gotten huge pushback to the point of coercion from the justice department with the justice department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of eric garner almost two years ago thats the level of pushback the obama justice department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters prince said 
theres five different parts of the fbi conducting investigations into these things with constant downdrafts from the obama justice department so in the i hope unlikely and very unfortunate event that hillary clinton is elected president we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since i believe  prince declared 
marlow asked prince to clarify these revelations 
nypd was the first one to look at that laptop prince elaborated weiner and huma abedin his wife  the closest adviser of hillary clinton for  years  have both flipped they are cooperating with the government they both have  they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes for huma abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the state department server and from hillary clintons own homebrew server which contained classified information weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found 
so nypd first gets that computer they see how disgusting it is they keep a copy of everything and they pass a copy on to the fbi which finally pushes the fbi off their chairs making comey reopen that investigation which was indicated in the letter last week the point being nypd has all the information and they will pursue justice within their rights if the fbi doesnt prince contended 
there is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails theyve seen of that  including money laundering underage sex payforplay and of course plenty of proof of inappropriate handling sendingreceiving of classified information up to sap level special access programs he stated 
so the plot thickens nypd was pushing because as an article quoted one of the chiefs  thats the level just below commissioner  he said as a parent as a father with daughters he could not let that level of evil continue prince said 
he noted that the fbi can investigate these matters but they cant convene a grand jury they cant file charges 
the prosecutors the justice department has to do that he explained now as i understand it preet bharara the manhattan prosecutor has gotten ahold of some of this from what i hear hes a standup guy and hopefully he does the right thing 
marlow agreed that bhararas sterling reputation as a determined prosecutor was bad news for the clintons 
prince agreed but said if people are willing to bend or break the law and dont really care about the constitution or due process  if youre willing to use stalinist tactics against someone  who knows what level of pressure could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials 
listen to interview here 
the point being fortunately its not just the fbi there are five different offices that are in the hunt for justice but the nypd has it as well prince said citing the wall street journal reporting that has exposed downdraft back pressure from the justice department against both the fbi and nypd in an effort to keep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on and is slowly being exposed 
the justice department is trying to run out the clock to elect hillary clinton to prevent any real justice from being done he warned 
as for the mayor of new york city prince said he has heard that de blasio wants to stay away from this 
the evidence is so bad the email content is so bad that i think even he wants to stay away from it which is really telling he said

its easy to glance at tuesdays popular vote  which with  percent of all precincts reporting shows hillary clinton with six million fewer votes than barack obama won in   and reach the conclusion that clinton lost the white house because she failed to turn out the democratic base but the truth is much more complicated while she underperformed relative to obamas  totals in several midwestern states  ohio michigan iowa and wisconsin  clinton ran virtually even with obama in the battlegrounds of pennsylvania north carolina virginia nevada and new hampshire whats more she far surpassed obamas  vote total in florida the countrys biggest swing state yet somehow while obama carried florida clinton lost it which brings us to an important question was donald trump just good enough to beat a bad democratic opponent on tuesday or does he deserve far more credit could he for instance have competed with the vaunted obama machine the answer somewhat shockingly is yes 
a review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that trump  would have defeated obama  in the electoral college disclaimer this obviously is an applestooranges exercise because no two elections are the same nor are any two electorates still unlike debating whether the  cubs would defeat the  yankees this is not an entirely abstract argument a comparison of their respective performances in the countrys most competitive states shows trump edging obama in a hypothetical headtohead matchup the math might seem impossible after all obama won nearly  million votes in  trump is currently at  million and should finish around  million which will actually be one million fewer votes than mitt romney won how then could trump have topped obama in the electoral college the answer republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nations most critical battleground states lets look at them individually in descending order by population and do the electoralvote math the  totals arent yet final because not all precincts have reported

okay lets address this hillary might win the popular vote isnt that electoral college situation just awful thing head on 
no its not awful its great and it protects the importance of your vote its also uniquely american and demonstrates yet again the onceincreation brilliance of the founding fathers 
first of all shes probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast she may win the number of votes counted but not the votes cast 
states dont count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference if there is a margin of  votes counted and there are  absentee ballots outstanding then the state tabulates those if the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldnt influence the election results then the absentee ballots arent counted 
who votes by absentee ballot students overseas the military businesspeople on trips etc the historical breakout for absentee ballots is about  republican in  when al gore won the popular vote nationally by  votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder there were  million absentee ballots in california alone a  breakout of those yields a  to million republican vote advantage so bush would have gotten a vote margin from californias uncounted absentee ballots alone so much for gores  popular vote victory that was the headline on the ny times and it was the lead story on nbc nightly news right no youre kidding 
getting back to the win the popular votelose the electoral college scenario thank gd we have that or else california and ny would determine every election every time 
but the electoral college brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say as do madison ave execs and factory workers in tennessee 
shortcomings sure the ec can make an r vote meaningless in a very few heavily d states or vice versa but without the electoral college the countrys entire population is subject to the disproportionate voting preferences of the few most populous states  american thinker comment on this article via your facebook account comment on this article via your disqus account follow us on facebook",2016-11-13

political activist and hillary supporter amal clooney traveled to texas to warn americans about our elected president donald j trump and his tough immigration policies maybe she didnt get the memotrumps tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of gop primary contenders it wasnt too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence there will never be a president trump 
perhaps amal shouldve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of american ranchers and threatened the safety and security of american citizens living in homes in or near the us mexican border towns 
amal clooney has warned that many of presidentelect trumps proposals would be violations of international law 
speaking at the texas conference for women at the austin convention center on tuesday the international human rights lawyer and wife of george clooney said she had concerns about americas reputation under the real estate moguls plans 
she noted that trumps comments during his campaign that there should be a religious test imposed on entering the us or the fact that there should be statesponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed  all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that 
the yearold wife said americas reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk 
i think theres some concern from abroad as to are these things actually going to happen or is the us going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally according to the hollywood reporter 
perhaps its time to put our nations security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us 
both amal and her hollywood actor husband george a staunch hillary clinton supporter have spoken out against trump in the past 
earlier this year amal clooney called for trump to be challenged on his extreme views 
watch george clooney here whine about press giving trump too much favorable press 
when you listen to what the leading candidate on the republican side has been saying about building walls about excluding mexicans and a complete shutdown of all muslims entering in and if you actually look at what he specifically said in that now infamous speech about muslims he kept saying they only want jihad they dont believe in our way of life they dont respect our system clooney said via daily mail",2016-11-15

trump didnt say nbc reporter katy tur by name but talked about an nbc female correspondent who got it wrong then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when hillary lost who hosted a debate  which was martha raddatz who was also in the room 
the stunned reporters tried to get a word in edgewise to discuss access to a trump administration

34,kellyanne conway loses it on jake tapper when he calls out trumps bigoted fans video,"on november    am  
donald trumps deplorable supporters arent waiting for the election results to start spilling blood 
theyve been threatening bloody violence ever since trump began claiming that the election is rigged in favor of hillary clinton and trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places 
in texas last week a trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of trumps stupid hats and a deplorables tshirt to vote 
election code prohibits any person from electioneering within  feet of a polling place 
of course trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules dont apply to them 
well now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down 
at collin college in plano texas a trump sign was discovered ziptied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places 
but when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside the blades sliced into the volunteers hands and drew blood requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal 
it just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody whos probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other local democratic party campaign chair steve spainhouer said in response  i think most people have already made their minds up at this point how theyre going to vote and so theres nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful 
heres the video via ktvt  
frankly this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism trumps supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as election day approaches and if trump loses his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup 
clearly these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger but you wont hear donald trump condemning this act of violence after all he is the one inciting it

35,internet erupts in mockery after sarah palin posts something monumentally stupid again tweets,"on october    pm  
new video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father fred trump young donald trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants 
as part of an investigation by nbc news stanley leibowitz who worked as a rental agent for the trump organization told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties 
in the interview leibowitz said that trump told him i dont rent to the nword and indicates that trump made this statement with donald trump in the room and that the younger trump affirmed the policy 
the revelation comes at the same time that the clinton campaign has released a video highlighting trumps runin with the federal government over discrimination 
undercover investigators were sent to trump properties and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing the white applicants were allowed into the trump properties 
one bit of testimony determined that trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a c on the documents for colored and that was a sign that they should be denied 
the trumps denied the allegation but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing 
donald trumps involvement with his fathers business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media as is his fathers  million dollars that he gave to trump to start his business but if you accept that the trump organizations history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story and no matter how trump may try to wave it away  its still there

weve all seen pictures of the trumps in their home surrounded by tacky gold decor complete with their young son barron in a suit with toys in front of him while he stares at the camera off to the side of his parents its a life most of us can never imagine while were paying our monthly bills so whats it like growing up with donald trump as a father according to scott melker a former classmate of donald trump jrs at the university of pennsylvania being the former reality show stars son wasnt what one might imagine or given trumps temperament it might be exactly what youd imagine 
on facebook  mekler told of the animosity trumps son had for this father 
i was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends next door to donald jrs room i walked out of the room to find donald trump at his sons door there to pick him up for a baseball game he recalls there were quite a few students standing around watching trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate don jr opened the door wearing a yankee jersey 
then mekler told of the moment trump slapped his son in the face in front of others 
without saying a word his father slapped him across the face knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates he simply said put on a suit and meet me outside and closed the door melker wrote 
donald jr was a drunk in college every memory i have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking he continued he absolutely despised his father and hated the attention that his last name afforded him his nickname was diaper don because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other peoples beds and urinate i always felt terrible for him he continued 
mekler said part of his reason for voting for hillary clinton is because in light of what i saw that day it is clear to me that donald trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country 
to be clear we are not demonizing trumps son for having an alleged drinking problem during his college days whether melkers story is accurate or not were not sure but given trumps awful temper its difficult to discount it

gop presidential nominee donald trump has taken a ridiculously hardline  and even bigoted  stance on immigration he has promised to build a wall and force mexico to pay for it and he has said that he will erect deportation forces to root out and get rid of all people in the united states without proper documentation well as we already knew it turns out that the donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one 
according to the associated press  it turns out that donald trumps wife melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the united states when she first arrived from her native slovenia melania often modeled using just her first name and was first granted entry into the country on a visitors visa known as a bb visa this occurred on august   melania did not get a legal work visa until october   during the time when she was prohibited from working in the country melania made money on ten different modeling assignments totaling upwards of  she got a green card in  and became a naturalized citizen in  
so in other words melania trump lied about her immigration story as recently as thursday when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go and that this is how she did it melania said in part in her stump speech 
as a young entrepreneur i wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance so of course i came here living and working in america was a true blessing but i wanted something more i wanted to be an american 
well it appears that as has long been suspected that melania trump wasnt as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims the information obtained by the ap include but are not limited to her contract from metropolitan international management  a modeling agency also theres the ledgers from the agency which is no longer in business that shows melania working during the time when she had the visitors visa but no work visa it seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up melanias wrongdoing but it is certainly quite interesting this would be why melania trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the united states and her eventual path to citizenship while it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud you can read more here at the associated press  
the long and short of it is this donald trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the other namely immigrants that is the height of hypocrisy seeing as how his own wife didnt completely comply with immigration law hopefully this story and the many other lies and coverups and shady dealings surrounding the trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time

a yearold man in allen park michigan has just been charged with six felonies after he held six children at gunpoint because he thought theyd damaged the donald trump sign on his lawn yes this is the kind of deranged emotionally unstable supporters trump has attracted 
the man michael robert kubek had called police on october th to report that his trump sign had been hit by teenagers who had fled the scene when the police arrived at the scene they didnt find kubek at his home  however when the officers followed the screams coming from around the corner there he was 
the police saw kubek standing over six children ages  who were sitting on the grass kubek accused the children of destroying his sign despite the fact that he never actually witnessed them doing it the children denied any involvement and the officers told kubek to return to his house so they could speak to the children 
according to the kids they were simply on their way to the park for a birthday celebration when kubek had pulled out a gun and pointed it at them instructing them to sit down on the grass those witnessing the act took to social media to vent their shock twitter twitter 
the newsherald reported 
the officer asked him again if he could identify any of the kids as the one who damaged his sign but kubek repeated that he could not the officer then asked kubek if he pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the kids according to police kubek said yes 
in response to another question from the officer kubek said he felt threatened because he was outnumbered 
yes a grown man used a gun because he felt outnumbered by a small group of innocent kids this is exactly the type of unhinged person who shouldnt be trusted with firearms kubeks hearing is scheduled for december th  lets hope that whatever happens to kubek that he is no longer considered a responsible gun owner you can watch a report below

trying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isnt hard getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that trump is the liar of liars is same thing with bullying but the new york times put together a spread of all the bullyish things trump has said and tweeted and to whom now the toronto star s daniel dale has been tracking trumps lies for just six weeks and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies which you can find here  
there are literally hundreds of lies in trumps speeches theyre not all  unique but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that trump will say anything to smear anyone including his enemies while keeping his supporters happy 
is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much tons of people claim hillary is a master liar but first shes actually more honest than most politicians second even if she could be considered anything like a master liar she still could not compete with trump the liar in any way shape or form 
the star put the lies into a whopping  categories clintons policies wtf daeshmiddle east clintons record african americansinner cities the clintons corruption rigged election tradeeconomy health care trumps endorsements refugeesimmigration polls obamas record the campaign russia trumps record taxes sex assault allegations clintons health and government corruption 
they also compiled a list of the top  types of lies trump has told and gave more detailed analysis beginning with the electoral system is rigged of course its rigged against him 
after plummeting in the polls after the first two debates trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election rigged became his catchword 
he claimed hillary clinton campaign workers hired thugs to cause violence at his rallies twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage clinton he claimed there was widespread voter fraud in philadelphia chicago and st louis  cities with large black populations that heavily favour democrats 
in greeley colo trump told his supporters if they dont trust mailin ballots they should vote again in person so one did trump supporter terri lynn rote a yearold from iowa was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice 
nobodys committing voter suppression and fraud quite like trumpsters and republicans 
another is muslims are risky this touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from syria who could be the great trojan horse of our time 
his claims that syrian refugees   per cent are muslim  are terrorists plays to the fears of the other even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children and their numbers is nowhere near trumps claims  about  have been admitted to the united states in  
the polls favour trump har de har har  trump only looks at the polls he likes and theyre usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls very few of the established scientific polls favor him nevertheless 
it seems clear trump manipulates exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is this poll denialism gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data suggests cnn 
his false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling  and perhaps even the vote itself if supporters feel trump should be doing better then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible 
on oct  he said i won the last two debates and every poll showed it in fact every scientific poll showed that he lost 
of course when unscientific online polls came out in his favour trump was quick to promote  and exaggerate  those numbers 
but these are just a few of his biggest most repeated lies he has also falsely said on twitter the failing nytimes reporters dont even call us anymore they just write whatever they want to write making up sources along the way falsely said by open borders hillary means totally unlimited immigration falsely said hillarys plan includes an open border with the middle east falsely called nbc anchor lester holt the moderator of the first debate a democrat falsely said wow just came out on secret tape that crooked hillary wants to take in as many syrians as possible falsely said the us provided iran  billion as part of the nuclear deal falsely said in san bernardino many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed  and wounded many many peoplemuslims have to report the problems when they see them falsely asserted that clinton has been fighting isis her entire adult life falsely said all together the hillary clinton plan would bring in  refugees in her first term falsely claimed he had been acknowledged to be correct in declaring nato obsolete because it doesnt cover terror falsely suggested nato created an antiterror position because of his comments falsely claimed clinton didnt release cholesterol or ekg information falsely said sexual assault allegations against him have been largely debunked falsely said apparently of sexual assault accuser summer zervos the one young lady has five family members saying what she said is absolute nonsense falsely said i did not i did not to clintons charge that he thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese falsely said i was against going into iraq and its so welldocumented falsely said our taxes are so high just about the highest in the world 
and so many more just in the last six weeks yes many of them are repeats but lies are lies if trump sees this hell likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the papers lying and continue to sell the myth that hes not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies

south carolina senator lindsey graham told wyfftv that trump should pick texas senator ted cruz as the nominee and warned democrats not to block him which is hypocritical considering how republicans have treated president obamas nominee and threatened to block any nominees hillary clinton would have made had she won the election 
im here to tell my democratic colleagues that i voted for obamas nominees i expect them to give trumps nominees a fair shake he won this election he will pick a conservative i would put ted cruz on that list if they try to block this pick they will regret it if you dont honor trumps nominee youre making a huge mistake 
democrats should stand up and give graham a collective middle finger 
since antonin scalia died in february there has been a vacancy on the supreme court bench that has yet to be filled the body wasnt even cold yet before republicans vowed to block any nominee president obama picked to replace him going so far as to even deny garland a confirmation hearing thats far from the fair shake graham is asking democrats to give to a man as dangerous as ted cruz 
putting cruz on the supreme court would guarantee rulings against womens rights and lgbt rights as well as putting laws like the voting rights act and the civil rights act in further peril in no uncertain terms should democrats grant cruz a hearing nor should they respect any of trumps conservative choices for the court republicans should have thought about fair shakes before taking the totally unprecedented step of being complete assholes toward the supreme court nominee of a sitting president who also won an election and s far more popular than trump again senate republicans didnt even give garland a hearing or a vote they refused to do their jobs entirely out of disrespect towards president obama and so thats exactly what democrats should do to trump turnabout is fair play and republicans only have themselves to blame

trump fans may have won the election but they arent taking a break from expressing their racist hatred of michelle obama the donalds deplorables were out in force after the first lady posed for the cover of vogue 
i could have spent eight years doing anything  and at some level it would have been fine obama told the magazine  i could have focused on flowers i could have focused on decor i could have focused on entertainment because any first lady rightfully gets to define her role theres no legislative authority youre not elected and thats a wonderful gift of freedom 
in exercising her freedom michelle obama has done quite a bit to push education healthy eating and support for our veterans  and in exercising their freedom the right has responded with nothing but hate the reaction to the first lady appearing in elegant clothing was typical readers of yahoo news showered obama with racist remarks calling her an ape and a monkey and even wishing death upon her for the horrific crime of wearing pretty clothes 
if you thought this behavior would stop after the election you were wrong trump fans are not done by a long shot  and now they have been emboldened by america electing its first official kkk candidate 
it will get worse before it gets better

as predicted donald trumps victory on election day has emboldened racist conservatives to start harassing and attacking minorities 
and its even happening in the deep blue state of california where a woman spotted a sign hanging on the side of a building in the town of pittsburg and snapped a photo of it 
twitter user james thompson posted the image of the sign on the social media platform after his sister sent it to him this picture was taken in pittsburgh california my sister texted this to me  minutes agoour democracy is being tested even in california pictwittercomgdlkwlox 
 james thompson jetballin november   
the sign clearly promotes lynching to prevent africanamericans from getting equal rights 
you can hang a nr from a tree  equal rights he will never see it says 
the fbi has been notified and local police have filed a lawsuit in an effort to force the owners of the sign to remove it 
in the wake of trumps surprising and depressing victory there has been a rise in the number of racist incidents in this country in fact there have been  reports of people being bullied by trump supporters since the election night results 
these incidents include the harassment of a muslim teacher by a student in georgia and students designating water fountains white or colored at a florida high school 
frankly there are so many incidents that its difficult to list them all you can find a somewhat comprehensive tally here  
this is what trumps america looks like and its scary and this has all happend in the course of a few days as melania trump continues to tell the media that her focus will be on ending bullying what exactly does she mean by that is she going to call out all bullying including the racist bullying being perpetrated by her husbands own supporters or is she going to ignore those incidents and merely whine about people who criticize her husband because right now she isnt even first lady yet and her effort has failed miserably and she only has her husband to blame",2016-11-12

post election the media and donald trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history they are making the claim that trump wasnt elected because of racism he was elected because of the economy the problem with that argument though is that its simply not true trump voters are racist and theres proof 
the american national elections study anes began the study in january initially they asked how likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead now of course anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that its very unlikely that whites arent getting jobs because minorities are but thats not what trump voters think the vast majority said that its extremely likely that minorities are taking jobs from white people graph courtesy of anes and salon  
then they asked the same trump voters about a nonracial issue trade despite the fact that trade was one of trumps signature issues their opinions on trade were mixed 
post election this is what the study found 
the question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for trump over clinton eightyfour percent of whites who believe it is extremely likely that whites cant find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support trump compared with  percent of those who think it is not at all likely among white democrats  percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support trump over clinton compared with less than  percent of those who believe it is not at all likely eightyone percent of white women who think it is extremely likely people of color are taking jobs supported trump compared with  percent who dont think that 
more than that  percent of white trump supporters say black people are violent  percent think that of muslims 
unfortunately democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism hoping that eventually the aging bigots will die off it turns out their children are just as bad sean mcelwee the man who was responsible for publishing the study suggested this 
democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic racial and gender justice together a multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic racial and gender inequality as ive shown with political scientist jason mcdaniel racism often diminishes support for progressive policies the solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising american electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation 
great idea if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots claims go unchallenged

46,racist sign calls for lynching black people to prevent them from getting equal rights,"on november    pm  
before the leaked tape of donald trump describing his propensity to grab women by the pussy to billy bush it seemed that the media was ignoring donald trumps glaring faults as a presidential candidate during the primaries  for example he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors it turns out there might be a reason for that  trump was bribing the media  at least thats the accusation being made by megyn kelly of fox news 
in her memoire settle for more which will be released this week kelly said that trump likely received the infamous question in which she asked about the fact that he has called women fat pigs dogs slobs and disgusting animals that question set trump off on one of his twitter tirades these are only a portion 
the worst and most controversial of which was this 
as the election progressed it became more and more apparent that trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior he expected no demanded that the media kiss his orange ass if they didnt he would cut off access but before that he tried bribery 
while kelly couldnt speak for other members of the media she alleges that trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels with full perks while the attempt clearly didnt work on kelly she says that with some their loyalty came cheap or perhaps not so cheap 
this is actually one of the untold stories of the  campaign i was not the only journalist to whom trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage kelly said he also attempted to woo them with praise she said adding this is smart because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking 
trump tried to work the refs and some of the refs responded she said 
when it became obvious that some reporters were in the tank for trump she alleges in one chapter certain tv hosts would work with the candidate in advance on occasional trump criticism so they would appear unbiased she didnt identify them by name or media outlet 
source yahoo 
kelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which kelly asked about trumps treatment of women the candidate called fox news exec bill sammon who told him about the first question all we heard about though during the election was that it was hillary clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering the insider knowledge said that a woman in the flint michigan debate would ask a question about the flint water  
while bribing journalists isnt illegal per say it is highly unethical without the fourth estate exposing the underbelly of politicians and of politics democracy is impossible

its a common stereotype that food stamp recipients and those who abuse it are black hispanic or any other race but white according to the usda in their report for fiscal year   of recipients are white and  are black courtesy of travissonnocom 
while the media and americas culture will have you believe that black people or anyone who isnt white account for copious amounts of fraud theres a story breaking that you wont hear on fox news anytime soon or you might because any chance to crush the snap program they will take 
according to wcax news in new york 
more than  people have been nabbed for food stamp fraud in the north country 
investigators say over the past couple months people used their food stamps to get food or alcohol at the old time butcher block store in brushton 
police also say its not the first time the owner of that store dennis sauve has been charged with allowing such fraud 
police say more arrests are expected 
now heres the kicker theyre all white brushton new york where this bust happened has a population of roughly  people approximately  of the population is white and  are black these demographics are eerily similar to the food stamp capital of the country  owsley country kentucky which is  white and  republican maybe we should investigate them 
i just wish we could get the political affiliations of those arrested in brushton 
according to wptz news 
police say the arrests are the result of a yearlong investigation initiated by the franklin county department of social services fraud unit franklin county district attorneys office the united states department of agriculture and the new york state office of temporary and disability assistance helped with the investigation 
the store owner denis sauve also white has been charged with thirddegree grand larceny and misuse of food stamps 
this really isnt a racial issue so much as it is an i told you so issue while the food stamp program has one of the lowest rates of abuse than any other welfare program a lot of people buy into this misconception that it is the lazy blacks who account for all the fraud and woes of government assistance well here we are a major food stamp bust and every criminal involved is white

hopefully the financial despair the fictional president trump never becomes a reality but seeing as he has no experience is a businessman whos not as good as he says he is and the simpsons have been right thus far the futures looking pretty bleak 
heres the original clip of president lisa simpson calling out a donald trump presidency for his fiscal fallout and bad economy 
early on into trumps campaign the simpsons satirized the reality tv host turned presidentelect by having homer simpson somehow at the campaign rollout and falling into trumps hair if we could only go back to that moment and enjoy the comedy over reality 
now we have to reap what weve sown or rather what the less than half of voting americans have sown considering trump only won with the electoral college and lost the popular vote to hillary clinton in his own words big league

if donald trump takes peoples anger and turns it against muslims hispanics african americans and women we will be his worst nightmare 
and from what was just announced it seems that sanders has every intention of making good on that warning earlier today the vermont senator was named chair of outreach during a closeddoor senate democrat caucus meeting according to the hill  in his new role sanders will lead outreach to bluecollar voters  the very voters who became trump supporters this year sanders will also be the ranking member on the senate budget committee acknowledging that he has a heavy responsibility to help shape the priorities of the united states government sanders said im going to do everything that i can to make sure that the budget that leaves the united states congress is a budget that represents the needs of working families and a shrinking middle class and not billionaires with the announcement of sanders new position trump is definitely going to be a nervous wreck hes spent his entire presidential campaign claiming that he would help the working class and now sanders is in the position to challenge him and hold him to it for the next four years by elevating sanders to this new role democrats are moving to a more grassroots message fully aware that sanders presidential campaign and vision for america resonated with many voters as we saw with sanders popularity in the primaries the vermont senator struck a nerve with workers and families making him the perfect candidate to go up against trump as he takes office sen debbie stabenow dmich commented on sanders new responsibility we want to expand on that and he will be reaching out to all our allies we have a tremendous amount of talent in our caucus and we want to make sure everyone is contributing sanders hardly needed this promotion to upset trump as hes been one of the most outspoken politicians on twitter since trumps win twitter twitter twitter

donald trump has had a rocky relationship with the press ever since his presidential campaign and hes only punished them further for trying to report the truth since becoming the presidentelect 
on monday trump was set to have an off the record meeting with television networks to try and hash out presidential press access this meeting was particularly important because trump has previously limited press access and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected 
some reporters in attendance were nbcs deborah turness lester holt and chuck todd abcs james goldston george stephanopoulos david muir and martha raddatz cbs norah odonnell and charlie rose fox news bill shine jack abernethy jay wallace suzanne scott msnbcs phil griffin and cnns jeff zucker and erin burnett it was a good group and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan 
unfortunately instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward what the press got was a baby trump temper tantrum of epic proportions or as one person put it  it was like a fcking firing squad 
trump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media according to the new york post  one anonymous source said 
the meeting was a total disaster the tv execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the trump administration but instead they got a trumpstyle dressing down 
this claim was backed up by another person who said 
the meeting took place in a big board room and there were about  or  people including the big news anchors from all the networks 
trump kept saying were in a room of liars the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong he addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest deceitful liars he called out jeff zucker by name and said everyone at cnn was a liar and cnn was network of liars 
this attack left reporters stunned and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic trump barely let them speak while this is certainly shocking this behavior is completely typical of trump he has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings 
americans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is twitter twitter twitter 
interestingly enough trump spokeswoman kellyanne conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well she said 
excellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days 
disgraceful

remington researchs summary of the polling data asserted that the race has become increasingly competitive 
last week we found a presidential race where hillary clinton held a clear advantage this week we find an increasingly competitive race with just eight days to go trump appears to be holding strong in his mustwin states and colorado remains within the margin of error the data also show that pennsylvania has moved into the margin of error category 
the presidential race remains very competitive as we move into the final stretch hillary maintains an advantage leading in colorado and pennsylvania but at this point anything can happen said titus bond director of remington research group 
other state polling data came out on sunday that also showed a closerace between trump and clinton although the polls were surveyed before fbi director james comeys announcement that they were reopening their investigation against clinton  via realclearpolitics  florida new york timessiena trump  percent clinton  percent nbcwall street journalmarist clinton  percent trump  percent gravis clinton  percent trump  percent colorado cbs newsyougov clinton  percent trump  percent arizona cbsyougov trump  percent clinton  percent north carolina nbcwall street journalmarist clinton  percent trump  percent gravis clinton  percent trump  percent cbs newsyougov clinton  percent trump  percent pennsylvania cbs newsyougov clinton  percent trump  percent 
the fact that some of these polls were close even before the comey announcement led to this observation from fivethirtyeights nate silver both things can be true  comey impact overblown  nate silver natesilver october   
radio host steve deace writes at conservative review that while early voting has been overwhelmingly in favor of clinton the renewed fbi investigation could have a potentially huge impact on election day 
trump was on defense on the election map as he had to defend states like arizona georgia utah indiana and alaska that rarely go blue on election day its quite conceivable that yet another reminder of the stench of corruption that has long surrounded the clintons could sway the bulk of republicanleaning undecideds trumps way but thats provided of course that he can withstand his compulsion to negatively influence a favorable news cycle as hes been prone to do then theres the matter of trumps emerging evan mcmullin headache in utah 
if trump can be disciplined this final week his campaign may have the freedom to focus its efforts on iowa nevada florida ohio and north carolina those five states would get him within striking distance to  electoral college votes and then you hope you can pull an upset in colorado pennsylvania or new mexico where trump is visiting during the campaigns final week the hope is that theres enough voters in those states wearier of clintons corruption than worried about whether trumps fit for office

barack obama must be pretty worried 
earlier this week white house press secretary josh earnest told the media that fbi director james comeys decision to reopen an investigation into hillary clinton didnt spring from bias or politics he explained  
director comey is a man of integrity and principle and well regarded by officials in both parties and served as a senior position in the bush administration and got bipartisan support when his nomination to be director of the fbi was considered by the united states senate they speak to his good character and the presidents assessment of his integrity and his character has not changed for example the president doesnt believe that director comey is trying to influence the outcome of the election and the president doesnt believe hes secretly supporting a candidate or political party hes in a tough spot hes the one who will be in the position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts including officials who served in senior justice position for presidents led by both parties 
now with the polls closing to within the margin of error president obama has had second thoughts he told nowthisnews  
i do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we dont operate on innuendo and we dont operate on incomplete information and we dont operate on leaks we operate based on concrete decisions that are made when this was investigated thoroughly last time the conclusion of the fbi the conclusion of the justice department the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was she had made some mistakes but that there wasnt anything there that was prosecutable 
its worthwhile pointing out the hypocrisy here  obamas entire administration has been built on innuendo his department of justice has destroyed police departments around the country with unsubstantiated innuendo about systemic racism his irs used innuendo to destroy conservative cs his entire  campaign was rooted in innuendo about mitt romneys supposed secret evils 
but more than anything the obama flip here shows serious desperation what changed the polls on monday it looked like the fbi scandal would detract from hillarys polling numbers but wouldnt kill her now it looks like she might go down in flames this shows how faithless obama is  comey was wonderful just up until the point he threatened hillarys chances at which point he became a slanderer trafficking in innuendo 
if comey has any stones he should resign in protest at obamas accusations hes already been thrown under the bus by his commanderinchief for not playing dead for him long enough to move hillary into the white house hes got no future in his position no matter what he does it would be a final redeeming move of honor to tell obama and his cronies to stuff it now tags",2016-11-02

uhoh 
according to bret baier of fox news the fbi has been investigating the clinton foundation for over a year and that investigation has been deep and wide  and just as importantly the fbi is on the verge of indictment for payforplay with regard to hillarys state department the fbi investigation has uncovered laptops from clinton top aides and the material on those laptops is being analyzed 
and most importantly of all  the sources at the fbi have apparently told baier with  percent accuracy that hillarys server was hacked at least five foreign intelligence agencies and information was withdrawn 
meanwhile we now know that the department of justice attempted to pressure the fbi into shutting down the investigation into the clinton foundation entirely according to the wall street journal  the fbi deputy director even asked the doj if they truly wanted to shut down a validly predicated investigation 
this is devastating information for hillary 
donald trump is now leading in florida ohio nevada iowa and north carolina trump is within spitting distance in colorado and pennsylvania and two new polls show trump up in virginia and new hampshire respectively if trump picks off any of those latter states he wins the election 
the best case scenario for hillary clinton just days ago was simple hunker down and wait out these scandals assume that as time goes on the race will revert back to its precomey normal with hillary hovering between a two and four percent lead but each new day brings a new revelation about her corruption and the corruption of the clinton foundation and state department each new day demonstrates the extent of the coverup by the obama administration 
hillarys running out of days to recover 
the only question is whether she can hang on with her fingernails now especially if the american public is upset enough about her payforplay and exposure of american classified material to put trump in the white house not trusting loretta lynchs doj to prosecute hillary for her crimes tags",2016-11-01

73,obama talks about himself  times in speeches supposedly about hillary," things you need to know about trump and sex slave island by amanda prestigiacomo may   
presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at hillary clinton when it comes to her husbands escapades the kitchen sink in this case is jeffery epsteins sex slave island and president bill clintons ties to it  
why wouldnt trump use this ammo the answer is simple trump himself has ties to epstein the billionaire democratic donor and convicted pedophile known for having underage sex slaves on his private plane and what the media calls sex slave island 
here are seven connections between trump and epsteins sex slave endeavors that you need to know about 
 trump himself has said that epstein is a lot of fun to be with adding that he admired the sex offenders affinity for beautiful women on the younger side 
ive known jeff for fifteen years terrific guy trump once said about the convicted sex offender hes a lot of fun to be with it is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as i do and many of them are on the younger side no doubt about it  jeffrey enjoys his social life 
 trump was named in epsteins little black book 
epsteins  little black book  was stolen by a former employee in  the book nicknamed the holy grail by the employee revealed the name of donald trump and listed  phone numbers including emergency numbers car numbers and numbers to trumps security guard and houseman 
 trump has allegedly flown on epsteins private plane  a hot spot for underage sex orgies 
mark epstein jeffreys brother testified in  that trump flew on jeffreys private jet at least once reports vice news  meanwhile message pads see below from epsteins palm beach mansion that were seized by investigators and obtained by vice news indicate that trump called epstein twice in november of  
epsteins private boeing  according to one of his alleged victims virginia roberts was nicknamed the lolita express roberts recalled unsavoury sex orgies on the private plane when she was just  years of age with epstein and his friends 
 both trump and epstein are named as sex abusers in a case with an underaged girl 
radar online reports that a woman in california identified as katie johnson filed a  million lawsuit against trump on april  accusing the real estate mogul of raping her when she was just  years old 
johnson claims trump raped her when she was yearsold and forced her to engage in sex acts by threatening to harm her and her family notes the independent uk  she claims the alleged abuse took place over a fourmonth period at underage sex parties held in new york city in  epstein was also named for alleged sexual misconduct and threats 
trumps team adamantly denies the accusation suspecting the claim is possibly a hoax since there is allegedly no evidence the plaintiff actually exists 
 epstein admitted to knowing trump under oath and curiously pled the fifth to trump attending sex parties with underage girls 
back in  epstein admitted to socializing with trump but when a lawyer representing an underaged victim of epsteins asked if he has ever socialized with donald trump in the presence of females under the age of  epstein curiously pled the fifth per vice news  q have you ever had a personal relationship with donald trump a what do you mean by personal relationship sir q have you socialized with him a yes sir q yes a yes sir q have you ever socialized with donald trump in the presence of females under the age of  a though id like to answer that question at least today im going to have to assert my fifth sixth and th amendment rights sir 
 at least one of epsteins underage sex victims was recruited from trumps maralago  which he frequented often 
virginia roberts an alleged victim of epsteins was recruited to perform a massage for epstein while working as a perhour locker room attendant at maralago 
roberts claims that epstein turned her into a sex slave and pimped her out to various friends including englands prince andrew over the years the passengers on epsteins jet she said included a whole bunch of other girls sometimes famous people sometimes some politicians 
 trump was subpoenaed in  for his connection to epsteins underage sex slave rings trump has denied ever being served 
in  trump was subpoenaed in a case against epstein concerning victim virginia roberts trumps attorney alan garten said that the subpoena never happened 
there is no debate over what happened said one of roberts attorneys i served mr trump with a subpoena for deposition in  he talked to me voluntarily and consequently we withdrew the subpoena in light of his voluntarily providing information i cant imagine there being any dispute of any of this 
additionally garten told vice news in january that mr trump has no relationship with epstein other than the democratic donor frequenting trumps maralago a lot of people hung out there including jeffrey epstein said garten that is the only connection 
according to the evidence however the connections with epstein appear to go a lot deeper than that tags",2016-11-04
74,obama tells black voters trump would tolerate kkk support in office,"christie lost republicans the  election he may be losing them the  election too by ben shapiro november   
ambition can be dangerous not just for the ambitious man or woman but for the country  for all those who ally with the ambitious person 
for the last eight years one of the most ambitious men in politics has been new jersey governor chris christie hailed as a conservative darling after taking on teachers unions in new jersey  brash language about punching them in the face marked his rise as a political force and an upandcomer in presidential politics  christie has nearly singlehandedly destroyed the republican party in two straight presidential elections 
in  christie was considered and rejected for vice president by mitt romney  but then gave the keynote speech in primetime at the republican convention there he spent the bulk of his time talking about his own wonders ignoring romney completely fox news chris wallace called the speech the most curious keynote speech i have ever heardfor a moment i forgot who was the nominee of the party 
then the week before the election hurricane sandy hit the east coast while new york governor andrew cuomo told president obama that his presence was unnecessary christie invited obama to new jersey then hugged him and took him on a tour of atlantic city where they made political love along the boardwalk underneath the cloudy skies i cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state christie said adding that it was my honor to introduce president obama christie was at the time facing down rumors that thennewark mayor corey booker who is black would run against him as the new york times noted the scene played out on televisions around the country like a stirring campaign ad that hit themes of bipartisanship and crisis management  only it was run free of charge 
obama surged in the final days and beat romney handily 
fast forward three years 
christie was running in the republican primaries hed done nothing much in the polls his only hope was to somehow do well in new hampshire he had no support in states like south carolina or nevada or southern states dominated by support for donald trump ted cruz and marco rubio so naturally he used his presence at the debate before the new hampshire primary  a state in which rubio was surging following his iowa showing  to destroy rubio christie rightly labeled rubio a robotic candidate rubio repeated himself christie hit him again  and rubio fell apart in the polling trump ran away with the state almost immediately christie quit the race and fell in behind trump thanks in large part to christies help trump won the nomination 
now with trump surging in the polls the week before his general election against hillary clinton christie has struck again this time two of his top aides have been found guilty on all charges related to bridgegate the scandal in which the christie administration allegedly blocked bridges in order to punish a local democrat who wouldnt endorse christies reelection bid  this story will allow the media to shift its focus to the trump campaign since christie is leader of trumps white house transition team in a tight election it could be enough to hand hillary the white house 
so thanks chris christie

78,clinton emails use arab female agitators to shame israel," stupid things voxcoms matthew yglesias has said by aaron bandler october   
matt yglesias of vox has always been a gold mine of comedy fodder given his penchant for saying things that are mindbogglingly asinine apparently yglesias agrees with this sentiment matt yglesias deleted something like  tweets yesterday clearly a man proud of his history of astute analysis and voxplanations 
fortunately the internet is forever and all of the stupid things that yglesias has said can still be found and mocked mercilessly 
here are  things yglesias has said that are incredibly dumb 
 yglesias was convinced that people would love obamacare that is until he didnt  mattyglesias obamacare marker  which was solid as of  minutes ago  appears to no longer be markering pictwittercomaeyximig  omri ceren cerenomri october   
his  piece is still available though and in it he whines about how supposedly the media for nonideological reasons is just massively biased toward negativity about this kind of thing yglesias also links to another piece of his in which he claimed that when obamacare becomes the status quo people will still be happy with the status quo quo and easy to frighten 
in other words yglesias felt that the plebs would eventually succumb to his way of thinking that all fell by the wayside when the obama administration admitted that premiums were set to increase by an average of  percent 
 yglesias made a racist comment toward former louisiana gov bobby jindal r in a  tweet that is now deleted yglesias wrote is bobby jindals reputation for intelligence anything other than ethnic stereotyping 
yglesias doubled down on his nasty comment when he received backlash tweeting oh fun conservative twitter is in bogus outrage mode 
eventually yglesias backed down tweeting for the record now that i know more about jindals life its clear that hes a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff 
the irony of yglesias saying this was not lost on twitter good thing you dont say dumb stuff mt mattyglesias its clear that jindals a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff  jon gabriel exjon june   
 yglesias once ranted against dumb jewish politicians the leftist pundit wrote a thinkprogress piece in  that was seriously titled dumb jewish politicians in which yglesias highlighted a passage from jonathan chait who wrote in the new republic that thensen joe lieberman ict had to be stupid for not supporting the public option 
i suspect that lieberman is the beneficiary or possibly the victim of a cultural stereotype that jews are smart and good with numbers chait wrote trust me its not true if senator smith from idaho was angering democrats by spewing uninformed platitudes most liberals would deride him as an idiot with lieberman we all suspect its part of a plan i think he just has no idea what hes talking about and doesnt care to learn 
yglesias agreed 
ive long held a related theory about eric cantor 
anyways this reminds me that at a meeting this morning i pitched the idea of trying to do health reform in a secret christmas morning session that only jewish senators would attend theres a whole bunch??boxer cardin feingold feinstein franken kohl lautenberg levin lieberman sanders schumer specter and wyden its a very progressive bunch and lieberman could easily be outvoted 
 yglesias advocated for ending time zones seriously in what was a typical example of vox being a waste of space yglesias wrote a  piece titled the case against time zones theyre impractical  outdated yglesias pontificated 
northern idaho is connected via i to spokane and seattle to its west but not to boise to its south so the couer dalene area is on pacific time rather than mountain time india has broken with the general scheme and adopted a halfhour staggered time zone so as to place the entire country on one time 
yet while these zigzags and minute zones destroy the pristine geometry of railroad time they serve a very practical purpose it is genuinely annoying to schedule meetings calls and other arrangements across time zones the need to constantly specify which time zone youre talking about is a drag commuting across time zones would be more annoying still which is why the suburbs of chicago that are located in indiana use illinois central time rather than indianapolis eastern time 
but the ultimate solution to this problem is not a lot of ad hoc deviations its to shift the world to one giant time zone 
ygleasias then called for one time to rule them alla phrase that prompted jrr tolkien to weep in his graveand then wrote this doozy 
if the whole world used a single gmtbased time schedules would still vary in general most people would sleep when its dark out and work when its light out so at  most of london would be at home or in bed and most of los angeles would be at the office but of course londons bartenders would probably be at work while some shift workers in la would be grabbing a nap the difference from today is that if you were putting together a londonla conference call at  thered be only one possible interpretation of the proposal a flight that leaves new york at  and lands in paris at  is a sixhour flight with no need to keep track of time zones if your appointment is in el paso at  you dont need to remember that its in a different time zone than the rest of texas 
pejman yousefzadeh explained just how stupid yglesiass time zone piece was writing at ricochet  i grant you that there are times when confusion does take place but seriously who cares is befuddlement regarding time zones really such a pressing issue that matthew yglesias has to take to writing an article demanding that we abolish them dont the people at vox have anything better to write about 
apparently they dont 
 yglesias doesnt understand floridas geography very well yglesias wrote a short blurb in the atlantic in  in which he began thinking aloud about the city of miami 
id been interested to know what if anything is legally or practically preventing the city from just expanding further and further west if anyone happens to know yglesias said 
people immediately pointed the obvious answer miami couldnt do so because there was this thing called a swampmost of which is the everglades national parkcausing such development to be difficult to accomplish 
yes yes commenters i know its a freaking swamp but theres plenty of development on exswampland in florida  hence all the canals and weirdlooking lakes an exasperated yglesias wrote in an update 
except that the land is not exswampland its an actual swamp  maybe yglesias shouldnt write a blurb that involves him thinking aloud 
 yglesias thinks that lying is perfectly fineif youre a politician yglesias found himself getting smacked around on twitter after he advocated for highspeed rail advocates to provide an unrealistically optimistic projection about the number of riders that will use the boondoggle program to obtain funding from the government 
for better or for worse thats politics yglesias wrote at thinkprogress  
on twitter yglesias attempted to justify it by writing fighting dishonesty with dishonesty is sometimes the right thing for advocates to do yes 
and yet yglesias had the temerity to accuse journalist eli lake of being dishonest on twitter 
yglesias must have realized how badly he put himself in a catch when he told the daily caller to go f yourself when they tried to interview him about the twitter incident 
 yglesias once hailed the department of veteran affairs as a healthcare model the country should emulate the federalist s sean davis pointed to yglesias writing in  that the va was producing the highest quality care in the country their turnaround points the way toward solving americas healthcare crisis yglesias also tweeted at gop chairman reince priebus in  will reince be explaining the evils of socialized medicine to veterans this tweet was also deleted and for good reason since the va has caused  veteran deaths due to systemic problems with the agency 
 yglesias doesnt understand the purpose of the senate yglesias wrote the following for thinkprogress in  per the guardian  
if you add together the two republican senators from wyoming with the one from alaska one from south dakota one from new hampshire two from maine two from idaho two from nebraska one from nevada two from utah two from kansas two from mississippi one from iowa two from oklahoma two from kentucky one from louisiana two from south carolina and two from alabama the  of them collectively represent on a system in which you attribute half the population of a given state to a senator  percent of the american population meanwhile barbara boxer and dianne feinstein together represent  percent of the american population 
now of course texas is also a big state though at  percent of the population its a lot smaller than california and there are small states like vermont and north dakota that have two democratic senators so the point here isnt a narrowly partisan one though the wacky apportionment of the senate does have a partisan valence the point is that this is an unfair and bizarre way to run things if you consider that the mean state would contain two percent of the population we have just  senators representing the aboveaverage states even though they collectively contain  percent of the population the other  senators represent about  percent of the people if the iranians were to succeed in overthrowing their theocracy and set about to write a new constitution nobody in their right mind would recommend this system to them 
in three paragraphs of rambling incoherent nonsense yglesias missed the fact that the purpose of having two senators representing each state was so states with smaller populations would be properly represented and not have their interests swallowed up by states with larger populations 
 yglesias doesnt understand americas financial system yglesias showed his ignorance of the issue when he wrote in a  slate column that there were far far far too many banks in the country as there were  at the time yglesias bloviated that all these small banks were somehow dangerous 
 they are poorly managed you know how the best and brightest of wall street royally screw up sometimes this doesnt get better when you drill down to the lessbright and notasgood guys it gets worse and since small banks finance themselves almost entirely with loans from fdicensured depositors nobody is watching the store in effect the wellmanaged banks are being taxed to subsidize the poorly managed ones the dubious decisionmaking doesnt get as complicated as what you see on wall streetits mostly just classic boomandbust procyclical commercial real estate loansbut it creates all the same problems  they cant be regulated since these banks are so small they could be easily driven out of business by high regulatory compliance costs so since american public policy is perversely committed to preserving them small banks regularly get various kinds of carveouts from regulations and once the carveouts exist they create pressure for extension further up the food chain other times the compliance issues of small firms become a reason to simply not do tight regulation  they cant compete if you want the jpmorgan chases and bank of americas of the world to be held to account you need both regulation and competition but a bank serving a handful of rural counties or a single midsized city doesnt offer any real competition having a large share of americas banking sector tied up in tiny firms only makes it easier for a handful of big boys to monopolize bigtime finance 
davis debunked yglesiass argument which was devoid of citations and falsely claimed that there havent been any new banks formed in recent years there were at least four in  
yglesias arguments are so poorly reasoned and so poorly supported that it leads one to question whether his post was thoughtlessly regurgitated from anticommunity bank talking points promoted by the big banks you guys the wall street banks that nearly destroyed america arent the problem small community banks where bankers actually know the borrowers are the real problem dont worry about the facts just go with it davis wrote in the federalist  im actually at a loss to come up with a more charitable explanation 
 yglesias thinks that black conservatives are a recent phenomenon after reading a review of a booker t washington biography yglesias started thinking about black conservative political tradition prompting him to write in a  thinkprogress post its only extremely recently that the idea of an africanamerican aligning himself à la clarence thomas with the mainstream conservative movement in america could be remotely possible but even so that didnt mean there was no ideological conflict in black politics or that general rightist sentiments somehow didnt exist 
this is patently false as damon root explained in reason  
actually the great harlem renaissance author and journalist george schuylerwho was known as the black hl menckenpublished general rightist sentiments long before clarence thomas came on the scene including schuylers unambiguously titled  autobiography black and conservative and the celebrated novelist and folklorist zora neale hurston both endorsed conservative sen robert a taft in the  presidential election and repeatedly attacked fdrs new deal 
 yglesias expressed joy when andrew breitbart died following breitbarts death yglesias tweeted  conventions around dead people are ridiculous the world outlook is slightly improved with andrewbrietbart sic dead 
this tweet has also been deleted and for good reasoncelebrating the death of someone just because of political differences is worse than stupid its ghoulish vile and reprehensible and slate defended yglesias stating that he is a very passionate journalist and slate values that passion 
apparently slate believes that passion trumps basic human decency and a reasonable iq level and yglesias certainly does not possess the latter two qualities",2016-11-06

86,the  biggest losers in donald trumps stunning victory,"the media lost all of its political power last night  thank you donald trump by john nolte november   
the morally dark obamaera is over and utterly and totally repudiated the clintons have finally and forever been staked in their mercenary black hearts our smug supremacist overlords in the elite establishment of both parties these rotting rentseeking parasites are now vanquished but nothing is grander nothing is more glorious nothing is more satisfying nothing is sweeter nothing is more validating nothing is better for america than the death of the mainstream medias political power 
the elite national political media is done as a force moral or otherwise in this country done buried exposed over out and using a slowacting poison called hubris it was death by suicide so smug so sure of themselves so sanctimonious so snarkfilled so utterly incapable of anything close to selfreflection 
the selfinduced poison took effect over a number of years and through five steps 
here they are 
 pimping for obamacare 
the national political media didnt just cheerlead for obamacare they lied to us willfully and with malicious intent they all lied to us the outlawing of almost every existing insurance plan was right there in the bill right there in black and white but the media didnt care they wanted to give their precious obama a win and in order to do that they jumped on board the you can keep your insurance propaganda express worse those of us who did tell the truth were branded as liars and racists not only by the pundits but by those godforsaken factcheckers 
then utopia met reality 
then the lies were exposed 
and the result is that up to and including last night at both the local and national level obamacare has decimated the democrat party but nowhere near as bad as it has decimated the middle class 
the medias role in this is unforgivable and destroyed whatever remained of their moral authority from here on they could only get more sweaty desperate and dangerous 
 casting off every journalistic ethic to destroy trump 
openly proudly and belligerently in order to hijack a presidential election we were treated to the pompous announcement that trump was such a threat to humanity it was now time for journalists throughout the land to cast off every standard that makes journalism journalism starting with objectivity 
even former good guys like cnns jake tapper morphed into an unrecognizable lyingsnarkvirtuesignalingmachines  another rotting cog in the narrative wheel a mindless member of a selfdeluded governmentworshiping cult that wouldnt piss on middle america if we were on fire 
professional sobriety was cast off because this one was in the bag baby and who could miss the historic opportunity to selfrighteously pointandlaugh at the hideous rubes as they were finally and forever being buried alive under a brave new world 
 grind donald trump to dust 
while there is no question trump deserved a few of the kitchen sinks hurled his way never in my  years have i seen such a coordinated desperate dishonest and poisonous campaign to disqualify a human being through the dark art of stripping him and his supporters of all their humanity 
 embracing confirmation bias 
the longer the general election rolled on the smaller the bubble of selfdelusion became 
inconvenient polls were sneered at and voxsplained away 
exit polls could only means one thing even though it was pretty clear they might mean another 
my personal favorite was the late editorials where based on no counted votes whatsoever we were trolled with the news that it was hillary not trump who would emerge victorious with the hidden vote oh the delicious irony of that oh how lovely it would be to rub that in the rubes faces on election night 
by the time the votes were actually being counted i was about  sure hillary would win the new york times however was  sure abcnbccbsapbsnprcnnwashingtonpostpolitico were  sure 
but even i understood that state and local polls were more erratic than ever that hillary did seem legitimately freaked about the upper midwest that the best pollster in the country had trump up  that trump never lost his fervent base that the right trackwrong track numbers had been upside down for a decade that there was still a largerthanusual number of undecideds that this thing that was real might not be enough to win but it was still real 
no no we were told its all smoke and mirrors all goldleafed trump steaks look at obamas approval ratings look at the hispanic vote look at this squirrel and that squirrel and the other squirrel over there sit down son dont you understand that im a data machine its science rube dont you vox racist 
and then the worst thing imaginable happened 
 the media lost the election 
the hate the lies the removal of the mask of objectivity the pushing of every single chip into the middle of the table  that can actually work  if you win 
but the media didnt win 
in the most spectacular fashion with their pants down and their bare ass hanging out for the world to see they lost 
and with that loss went everything 
and now the media is exposed in front of the whole world as a swaggering potemkin bully that no longer has the power to sway public opinion even when they throw absolutely everything they have at one man and do so with much of the republican party on their side 
not only has the media forever been exposed as brazenly dishonest and laughably out of touch worse than all that they are exposed as weak a force no one need ever fear or kowtow to again 
without that sheen of fear without that threat of intimidation like a vanquished bully so goes all their power 
f you mainstream media 
 
the delicious irony of all this is that the last desperate gasp of the political media did actually prove their precious barack obama correct about one thing 
the moral arc of history does indeed bend towards justice

some leftists still reeling from hillary clintons stunning defeat on tuesday are blaming her defeat on supposed sexism against a woman president however a new poll suggests that sexism did not play a role at all in clintons loss 
the poll conducted by conquest communications group and published on just facts  featured a question specifically geared toward gauging potential sexism if you were faced with a choice between a male and a female presidential candidate who would you vote for 
here were the results emphasis added 
overall  of voters said it does not matter  preferred a female  preferred a male  were unsure and  refused to answer 
male voters and trump voters were more likely than any other groups to say it does not matter at  and  respectively the other groups were not far behind and within the margins of error with rates of  for clinton voters  for undecided voters  for females 
naturally supporters of trump were more likely to support a male president than a female president percent to  percent respectivelyand clinton supporters were more likely to support female president than a male president  percent to  percent respectively 
the survey was conducted from october  so it was taken a couple of weeks before the election but its hard to imagine a majority of voters all of a sudden turned into a bunch of sexists 
there is a little bias towards a male president among trump voters and a little bias towards a female president among clinton voters but the results of the survey suggest that overall the genitalia of a candidate is not a significant factor involved in most voters when it comes to choosing the next president of the united states

presidentelect donald trump that is still a term that is surreal to a lot of people as he was not expected to win on tuesday what were the driving factors that propelled trump to the presidency how was he able to pull off such a stunning upset 
here are seven reasons why trump won 
 hillary clinton was unable to get the minority vote to turn out for her last night dems were calling the race a whitelash  wrong mitt won  of white vote trump won  minority voters didnt turn out  david french davidafrench november   
in fact trump was able to get a larger share of the minority vote than mitt romney did in  as the daily wire has explained  
unsurprisingly trump lost to clinton in the latino and black votes by margins of  percent to  percent and  percent and  percent respectively surprisingly this was better than romney fared among the aforementioned demographics in  as he lost both groups by margins of  percent to  percent and  percent to  percent respectively 
michael barone has noted that turnout fell in heavily black philadelphia cleveland detroit and milwaukee millennial generation turnout was tepid and trump carried white millennials by  points 
the enthusiasm was just not there for clinton 
 trump was able to pull in former obama voters according to the washington post  trump was able to win over onethird of the  counties that went for obama twice clinton was only able to win six of the  counties that didnt go for obama trump was better at obtaining crossover voters than clinton was 
so who are these former obama voters who voted for trump in  and what caused them to switch 
 these former obama voters felt that trump cared about them and the democrat party did not john daniel davidson explains in the federalist that clinton and the democrat party took the bluecollar working class whites in the rust belt for grantedexemplified by clintons pledge to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of businessand it was to their detriment the rust belt has been in economic decline for years but it has suffered greatly from the obama administrations regulations towards coal 
while the democrats wrote off the rust belt trump actually acknowledged their struggles and that was all it took 
trump was the first national political figure in generations who saw them acknowledged that they have been left behind that their cities and towns are in a state of persistent decline and promised to help out somehow writes davidson when youre used to being dismissed as bitter folks who cling to guns and religion as president obama did in  or denounced as deplorables and irredeemable as hillary clinton did during this election respect goes a long wayeven if there are no easy solutions from washington or anywhere else to the problems that plague your town 
 the fbi reopening its investigation into hillarys emails helped trump per redstate  author ed klein said on the steve malzberg show that clinton was sobbing inconsolably on election night and was blaming fbi director james comey reopening the investigation as well as obama for not stopping the investigation as to why she lost 
theres no question that the reopening of the investigation did considerably help trump as the polls severely tightened after the announcement poll numbers showed that the vast majority of americans felt that hillary was acting in an immoral manner the spotlight was off of trumps vulgar comments towards women and his sexual assault accusers and instead the focus was on clintons private email server but clinton is leaving out one major person who is responsible for her loss 
 hillary was a terrible candidate if clinton had been elected president she would have been the first elected president to have been the subject of numerous fbi investigations she broke the law by using her private email server to conduct official state department business and there was a lot of quid pro quo that occurred at the clinton foundation  clinton is robotic and devoid of charisma with a record in politics that is short of accomplishments but rich in failure sleaze and corruption basically clinton is an obama democrat without obamas charm according to jonah goldberg  
she may have been the only democratic candidate that could lose to trump and the democrats wanted to coronate her from the beginning they have no one to blame but themselves for president trump 
 the public no longer has any faith in the mediaand that includes latenight comics will rahn wrote at cbs news that the unbearable smugness of the clintonbiased media was offputting to a lot of voters as they sneered at trump supporters as stupid backward hicks while doing everything they could to prop up clinton trumps vitriol toward the press ended up benefiting him politically poll numbers reflect this as trust in the media has declined over the years rahn explains 
journalists increasingly dont even believe in the possibility of reasoned disagreement and as such ascribe cynical motives to those who think about things a different way we see this in the ongoing veneration of facts the ones peddled by explainer websites and data journalists who believe themselves to be curiously postideological 
that the explainers and data journalists so frequently get things hilariously wrong never invites the soulsearching youd think it would instead it all just somehow leads us to more smugness more meanness more certainty from the reporters and pundits faced with defeat we retreat further into our bubble assumptions left unchecked no its the voters who are wrong 
as a direct result we get it wrong with greater frequency out on the road we forget to ask the right questions we cant even imagine the right question we go into assignments too certain that what we find will serve to justify our biases the publics estimation of the press declines even further  fewer than oneinthree americans trust the press per gallup  which starts the cycle anew 
the same applies to latenight comics mollie hemingway writes in the federalist that jon stewart is partly responsible for the election of trump because of how he singlehandedly destroyed cnns crossfire resulting in a new age of hyperpolitical hyperliberal latenight comedy stewarts the daily show spawned stephen colbert john oliver trevor noah and several other lefty comics that perverted comedy into smarmy leftwing political lectures talking down to conservatives 
jon stewart is known for brutally deriding a show that featured people of differing views civilly discussing issues of the day writes hemingway he got that show killed and significantly strengthened the world where cultural elites engaged in groupthink mockery of those with whom they disagree the results include a further erosion of civility a decrease in americans ability to understand each other and their concerns and of all things presidentelect donald trump 
which all culminates into the main reason why trump was elected 
 americans are tired of being trashed by leftist elites ben shapiro explains  
trump won because many americans were sick of being told that they were the racists as barack obama and his department of justice stoked race riots in major cities around the country 
trump won because many americans were sick of watching other americans being destroyed for their supposed intolerance  for their religious beliefs for their unwillingness to label women men and men women for their support for traditional marriage or conservative political candidates 
trump won because many americans were tired of the medias constant harping on americas flaws  we were supposedly sexist racist and homophobic americans said that they did not believe the media and they were right to do so 
in other words the left has been tearing down america as a country infested with intolerant prejudicial bigots who are incapable of thinking for themselves and needed to rely on them on how to live their lives the people finally had had enough so they elected the man whom they felt best stuck it to the leftist elites tags",2016-11-11
97,chelsea for president,"this is the best picture in human history by november   
this is the best picture in human history 
it is the best picture in human history because it tells the entire tale of both parties the republic and why we are where we are 
on the left side of this picture we have donald trump  a reality television star and lifelong vulgarian the new presidentelect of the united states he points his fingers and smiles that apprentice smile as he makes a point 
on the right side of this picture we have barack obama  a man who considered himself a paragon of dignity and rectitude who thought of himself as a transformative figure and an intellectual giant he sits next to the man who maintained for years that his birth certificate was a fraud the man who has the opportunity to undo virtually his entire agenda within the first month of his assumption of office and obama rightly looks like a man with a pole shoved so far up his rectum that the glint of steel is visible behind his eyes 
behind obama sits a bust of abraham lincoln his eyes downcast mourning for his country 
yep 
greatest picture ever 
this is a picture of justice done and karma ascendant barack obamas image of himself is not accurate  to americans obama is a reality tv show star he transformed the presidency from a dignified office into a selfiestick celebrityridden sinkhole of hollywood glitterati hobnobbing with glozell and macklemore cracking wise about the presidency with jimmy kimmel before saying that a reality star like trump could never be president 
this picture looks like the chickens coming home to roost as obamas former pastor might put it 
and then theres lincoln 
lincoln who gave his life and spent his presidency building the groundwork for racial toleration mourning behind barack obama who has spent his presidency polarizing for electoral gain 
lincoln who represented wisdom mourning behind a clown as the clown gestures to the assembled crowd given republicans domination of the senate and the congress i have hopes for trumps presidency  i hope he keeps his promises and that he becomes a better man and a wonderful president and believe he has every obligation to fulfill his conservative campaign promises  but trump occupying lincolns office is at best a jarring visual

101,california cafe wants legal fees paid by muslim women who sued them,"frank camp november   
during an interview with lesley stahl for  minutes  which will air in its entirety sunday night donald trump began to walk back his campaign promise regarding the deportation of illegal immigrants 
we are getting them out of our country the president elect said about the several million illegal immigrants with serious criminal records after the border is secure and after everything gets normalized were going to make a determination on the people youre talking about who are terrific people theyre terrific people who were going to make a determination on but before we make a determination we want to secure our border 
gasp 
donald trump rose to political fame on the back of his strong stance on illegal immigration throughout the primary process he promised a  deportation force  telling msnbcs mika brzezinski in november  
youre going to have a deportation force and youre going to do it humanely dont forget mika that you have millions of people that are waiting in line to come into this country and theyre waiting to come in legally and i always say the wall were going to build the wall its going to be a real deal its going to be a real wall 
in august trump delivered a major immigration speech in phoenix arizona in which he softened his stance a bit focusing on illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes 
within ice i am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in america who have evaded justice 
he then added that anyone who has entered the united states illegally is subject to deportation that is what it means to have laws and to have a country otherwise we dont have a country 
during the final presidential debate between donald trump and hillary clinton trump reiterated his position against amnesty 
well first of all clinton wants to give amnesty which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many many years we need strong borders 
for trump diehards these statements were enough their guy was going to deport  million illegal immigrants and no one would tell them otherwise however as anyone with access to google should know the president elect has long supported amnesty in some fashion 
in july  donald trump told cnns dana bash 
i would get people out and then have an expedited way of getting them back into the country so they can be legala lot of these people are helping usand sometimes its jobs a citizen of the united states doesnt want to do i want to move em out and were going to move em back in and let them be legal 
what trump was talking about is known as touchback amnesty such a plan would indeed involve the deportation of illegal immigrants but allow them an expedited means of returning to the united states in order to obtain legal status in other words they touch base in their home country then come right back 
in november  eric trump repeated his fathers plan during an interview with fox news megyn kelly 
the point isnt just deporting them its deporting them and letting them back in legally hes been so clear about that and i know the liberal media wants to misconstrue it but its deporting them and letting them back legally 
going back further trumps support for amnesty is even more stark speaking on fox  friends in  he said 
for people that have been here for years that have been hardworkers have good jobs theyre supporting their familyits very very tough to just say by the way  years you have to leave get outim one of the worlds very conservative people but i have to tell you on a human basis how do you throw somebody out thats lived in this country for twenty years 
during the  presidential election cycle trump even called mitt romneys idea of selfdeportation  maniacal  and remarked that republican party policy toward illegal immigrants was  meanspirited  
donald trump is a man who will say whatever he needs to in order to win now that he has won hes already backtracking on multiple campaign promises from the repeal of the affordable care act aca to the deportation of illegal immigrants tags",2016-11-13
102,watch traffic reporters savage message to those who threatened to leave us if trump won," thoughts on steve bannon as white house chief strategist by ben shapiro november   
so in a notunexpected move donald trump has elevated former breitbart news ceo steve bannon to chief strategist of the white house 
when i left breitbart back in march i accused bannon of turning breitbart news into trump pravda  as i wrote indeed breitbart news under the chairmanship of steve bannon has put a stake through the heart of andrews legacy in my opinion steve bannon is a bully and has sold out andrews mission in order to back another bully donald trump he has shaped the company into trumps personal pravda to the extent that he abandoned and undercut his own reporter 
that decision paid off for bannon  in august he became trumps campaign ceo at that point i wrote this piece describing who bannon was  and this one for the washington post describing his probable impact on the campaign  
with bannons accession to a top white house role its time to answer some brief questions about the man and what hes likely to do 
is bannon antisemitic and racist i have no evidence that bannons a racist or that hes an antisemite the huffington posts blaring headline white nationalist in the white house is overstated at the very least with that said as i wrote at the washington post in august bannon has openly embraced the racist and antisemitic altright  he called his breitbart  the platform of the altright  milo yiannopoulos the star writer at the site is an altright popularizer  even as he continuously declares with a wink that hes not a member the lefts opposition to trump and their attempts to declare all trump support the altright have obfuscated what the movement is the movement isnt all trump supporters its not conservatives unsatisfied with paul ryan nor is it people angry at the media bannon knows that hes a smart man not an ignorant one the altright in a nutshell believes that western culture is inseparable from european ethnicity  i have no evidence bannon believes that personally but hes happy to pander to those people and make common cause with them in order to transform conservatism into european farright nationalist populism that means that the altright will cheer bannon along as he marbles trumps speeches with talk of globalism  and that bannon wont be pushing trump to dump the racists and antisemites who support trump anytime soon after all they love bannon  actual white supremacists like peter brimelow called his august appointment great news and richard spencer explained breitbart has elective affinities with the alt right and the alt right has clearly influenced breitbart in this way breitbart has acted as a gateway to alt right ideas and writers i dont think it has done this deliberately again its a matter of elective affinities that doesnt mean bannon will push racist or antisemitic policy or that hell be antiisrael himself  unless it serves his interests 
what does bannons accession mean bannon has goals one of those goals is maximization of personal power which is why he spent the last decade and a half glomming onto powerful rightwing personalities bachmann morris palin kissing their asses and then moving on up the chain with breitbart and trump he picked two winners in a row  and that means hes now at the pinnacle of american power 
so what will he do with that power hell target enemies bannon is one of the most vicious people in politics which is why ive been joking for months that should trump win id be expecting my irs audit any moment that wasnt completely a joke he likes to destroy people 
but more importantly bannons interested in turning the republican party into a farright european party because republicans will like some of the policy that comes with that it could happen heres what i wrote in march about the trump movement  
trump is a europeanstyle response to the europeanstyle leftism of barack obama hes a soft europeanstyle populist from his interventionist economics to his closedborders foreign policy as i wrote in december compare trumps platform with that of marine le pen whose french national front poses a significant threat to the national political establishment she calls for harsher penalties for criminals significant restrictions on muslim immigration to france protectionism on trade a restoration of the franc as the national currency rather than the euro and big government in terms of health care this sounds a lot like trump but the european right is not the american right the american right believes in constitutional ideas about checks and balances and federalism and negative rights from government the european right doesnt believe any of these things should trump win we could watch american conservatism lose the only party it has ever had 
thats the plan yesterday the daily beast reported that bannon reached out to le pen for global ultraright coalition over the weekend le pen met with nigel farage of the uk independent party and trump met with farage shortly after being elected bannon has always wanted to burn down the gop thats still his goal he wants it replaced with an american national front party in fact if not in name 
which war will bannon lead bannon considers himself a wartime consigliore  always at war always so the only question left is this what will bannons actual role be its difficult to tell since trump announced the bannon hire at the same time he announced that former rnc chairman reince priebus as his chief of staff what will their relationship be like ed morrissey of hotair thinks that bannon will lead the antimedia fight and reince will coordinate with congress that would be the best possible scenario 
others have speculated that bannon has been added to the team as a sop to the populist base which would be angry at trump hopping into bed with the most establishmenty fellow in washington that too would be fine 
its hard to tell from the outside whats happening but heres a third theory reince is the bagman for trump and bannons whispering in trumps ear that would fit the fact pattern here given reinces outsized praise for bannon this morning wise and smartvery very smart very temperate bannon is anything but temperate to those who disagree hes a consummate bully to anyone who disagrees hes actually malevolent priebus may not have seen a lot of disagreement because hes the one catering to bannons agenda 
if bannons leading and reince is following that bodes ill for the republican agenda bannon opposes the republican party hates paul ryan  minutes after the joint bannonpriebus announcement breitbart news approvingly tweeted about a congressional rebellion against speaker ryan  and wants to watch it all burn bannon loves the firefight the only question is which direction hell turn his fire tags",2016-11-14

105,thoughts on steve bannon as white house chief strategist  dailywirecom,"shapiro eviscerates raucous protesters at university of wisconsin by hank berrien november   
daily wire editorinchief ben shapiro spoke at the university of wisconsinmadison on wednesday night and amid raucous leftist protesters who consistently tried to interrupt him and even blocked him from being seen by the audience by creating a human wall in front of him found a way to respond with hilarious repartee that left the audience howling and the protesters eventually filing meekly out of the auditorium 
after the ovation he received on entering shapiro quipped hey look at this a campus that doesnt actually try to arrest me when i come he continued before i begin i did come bearing gifts for the social justice warriors in this room i hear youve started wearing these safety pins around because you want to show your fellow college students how youre not one of these awful terrible trump people that youre sensitive and that you want to signal your virtue so ive brought along these safety pins holding up safety pins and i also brought you something to wear them with  this diaper 
shapiro then held up a diaper prompting huge laughs from the audience 
when a protester yelled at shapiro that he should be wearing a swastika shapiro held out his yarmulke then fired back in case you hadnt noticed the folks with the swastikas arent too nice to my type 
shapiro continued stop being selfindulgent children stop pretending that everybody who voted for trump is a vicious racist its your right to protest of course but you just make yourself look like an idiot when you cry over a dulyheld election  donald trump doesnt care about your protest donald trump is sitting somewhere in trump tower eating a steak and bathing in your salty salty tears 
referring to the attempt by leftists to prevent people who werent university students from attending shapiros lecture shapiro opined i hear that a lot of folks at this publiclyfunded university want this campus to become a sanctuary campus for illegal immigrants i do have a quick question if this campus can be a sanctuary for people in the country illegally why are so many people trying to ban american citizens from this community from coming to this lecture and by the way im aware of this private facebook page titled f white supremacy interrupting ben shapiro with all due respect f you right back gang 
after the applause subsided and shapiro joked about how both black lives mater and the kkk target him the real fun began protesters stood up chanting shame over and over again 
shapiro quipped wow its like game of thrones  should i get undressed and walk down the aisle 
the bulk of the crowd started booing the protesters shapiro addressed the protesters saying im happy to talk with you but they responded by screaming safety over and over shapiro joked did somebody fart the crowd responded to the protesters by chanting usa 
shapiro replied i tell you try not to be children the first thing you do is start screaming like my twoyearold he added you see this is how conservatives actually treat people you stand up and you interrupt and you shout safety and youre perfectly safe look at that its amazing that provoked sustained applause 
when the protesters started screaming shame again shapiro eviscerated them pointing out if youre going to pick a chant like shame watch game of thrones first the bad guys shout shame the audience loved that line on a roll shapiro continued youre not changing anybodys mind all youre showing everybody is that your collective iq if it were channeled into electricity night be able to toast a piece of bread lightly 
he continued okay can we talk now or are you going to keep shouting nows your chance to get it out lets hear your feelings cmon just go for it or is it going to be like every thirty seconds like an annoying microwave timer 
when the protesters resumed chanting shapiro responded if you guys want to talk we can talk if you want to shout get the hell out more applause 
shapiro fired for gods sake at least wait until i say something that offends you before getting offended 
shapiro returned to deconstructing the term social justice when the protesters started again a woman who runs a soup kitchen stood up and admonished the protesters that she had driven for ten hours that day and that they should shut freaking up and listen to the man speak that prompted a standing ovation from the crowd and shapiro too he added see thats what a decent hardworking person sounds like as opposed to a loser student here on the public dime presumably 
shapiro returned to his speech racial diversity doesnt mean anything decency means everything  diversity isnt our strength decency is our strength he turned to the protesters remember that decency 
the protesters screamed back shame shapiro fired back decency the protesters chanted shame but the crowd soon joined shapiro in chanting decency shutting the protesters up 
as shapiro spoke of the falsity of white privilege the protesters formed a line in front of shapiro prompting him to quip if you guys are all going to come up here can we all just have circle time or something 
the protesters chanted safety for a minute and a half but then the crowd started yelling back free speech matters shapiro turned to the blackboard behind him and wrote in capital letters morons that again prompted cheering 
one member of the audience yelled to the protesters at least tell us what you want or otherwise just get out that brought a sustained ovation 
after one protester tried to deliver a whiny monologue the protesters started shouting safety again then filed out yelling f white supremacy while flipping off shapiro and the entire audience that prompted the crowd to sing nananana nananana hey hey goodbye it also promoted this from shapiro 
even after leaving the lecture hall protestors continued to pound on the door 
after shapiro explained why the protesters had not been arrested as the university stated that it gave the protesters time to protest at the front of the stage or otherwise it would have to shut down the entire event he continued all i can wonder is if the administration would allow the same sort of privilege for any sort of conservative who decided to do this at a leftist event 
even after leaving the lecture hall protestors continued to pound on the door prompting shapiro to quip doesnt this school give homework does anybody have a job around here i guess when youre majoring in gender and diversity studies you have a lot of time on your hands 
shapiro noted that he had engaged in a backandforth with one of the protesters who accused him of being a white supremacist when he asked her why she thought so she replied that she got that impression from his image he fired back really was it the yarmulke that did it for you 
he took another shot at the protesters during the speech noting that people were born unequal and adding some people us are born rich some of us are born poor some of us are born smart some of us are born protesters 
the rest of the speech was vintage shapiro as was the qa afterward even the chalk was impressive

107,the week after trumps win the reaction of liberal college students," things you need to know about sanctuary cities by aaron bandler november   
with donald trump elected to the presidency one of the policies that will likely come under fire is sanctuary cities cities with policies that make them safe havens for illegal aliens the issue became frontandcenter during the early portion of the republican primary when trump decried the murder of kate steinle by an illegal alien in san francisco a sanctuary city 
in response to the election of trump leftist city leaders are digging in officials in los angeles chicago and boston signaling that they will not cooperate with the federal governments deportation efforts here are five things you need to know about sanctuary cities 
 sanctuary cities are a blatant violation of federal law some on the left have tried to claim that theyre perfectly legal but this is clearly false as james walsh  former associate general counsel of immigration and naturalization services explains  usc section  deals with those persons who knowingly conceal harbor or shield undocumented aliens and could apply to officials in sanctuary cities and states 
the fact that leftists are digging their heels in on sanctuary cities means theyre supporting a form of nullification an irony not missed by victor davis hanson  
much of the rural west opposes the endangered species act can wyoming declare that federally protected rats and bugs are not protected inside its state borders when such pests obstruct construction of dams or highways many conservatives oppose federal restrictions on gun sales could oklahoma city declare handgun purchases within its citylimits free of federal firearms statutes perhaps little rock could ignore a supreme court ruling and announce that gay marriage is not legal within its jurisdiction on what rationale would liberals in california object to such nullifications  that neither state nor city had the right to ignore a federal law or to obstruct the law enforcement duties of federal officials 
trump and the gop can fight against sanctuary cities by cutting off federal funding and sending in federal agents to mandate the cities to follow the law 
 sanctuary cities undermine law enforcement not only do they refuse to cooperate with federal agents in deporting illegals sanctuary cities make it more difficult for police officers to do their job some police officers in the los angeles police department lapd expressed their frustration with the citys sanctuary city policy to heather mac donald in  
we cant even talk about it says a frustrated lapd captain people are afraid of a backlash from hispanics another lapd commander in a predominantly hispanic ganginfested district sighs i would get a firestorm of criticism if i talked about enforcing the immigration law against illegals 
in that  piece mac donald documents how members of the lapd were able to recognize known gang members but couldnt do anything to apprehend them until they had committed a crime  despite the fact that they were illegals who repeatedly snuck back into the country this is the case with other sanctuary cities as well 
 sanctuary cities are akin to roulette the odds suggest that most illegal aliens detained by officials are not career felons and thus supposedly need not be turned over to ice for deportation writes hanson on the chance that some of their  released criminals will go on to commit further crimes in the manner of juan lopezsanchez officials then shrug that the public outcry will be episodic and quickly die down or will at least not pose political problems as great as would come from deporting aliens 
but the odds dont suggest this hanson notes that according to mac donald twothirds of all outstanding felony warrants in the city of los angeles involved illegal aliens  as well as  of outstanding murder warrants 
additionally jessica vaughn of the center for immigration studies found that in a ninemonth timeframe in  sanctuary cities shielded  illegals from deportation  percent of which had significant prior criminal histories and  of them were subsequently rearrested for new crimes according to daniel horowitz at conservative review 
there is no telling how many have committed crimes and were never caught writes horowitz this is just a ninemonth snapshot of the devastation from sanctuary policies as of last year  of them were still at large so much for not being a flight risk 
according to vaughn  from january  to september   sanctuary cities rebuked over  detainers  percent of which involved individuals with a prior criminal history 
based on these statistics it would seem that the odds are against the cities residents who could be harmed by criminal aliens which makes it no surprise that 
 crime has surged in sanctuary cities the daily wire s hank berrien reported on the following from louisiana attorney general jeff landry 
according to louisiana attorney general jeff landry crime has risen in sanctuary cities across the nation 
landry told the house judiciary committees subcommittee on immigration and border security that sanctuary city policies allow illegals to commit crimes then roam free in our communities landrys appearance was prompted by the changed status of new orleans where city police are now banned from asking an individuals immigration status 
using recent statistics from los angeles another sanctuary city landry asserted los angeles saw all crime rise in  violent crime up  percent homicides up  percent shooting victims up  percent rapes up  percent robberies up  percent and aggravated assault up  percent  sanctuary cities encourage further illegal immigration and promote an underground economy that sabotages the tax base 
this would make sense given the aforementioned statistics and the fact that there is a clear link between illegal immigration and crime  
 there are an estimated  sanctuary cities counties and states according to vaughn the full map on such jurisdictions can be seen here  do you live in a sanctuary city",2016-11-17
108,shapiro eviscerates raucous protesters at university of wisconsin  daily wire,"the left says i hate myself for voting trump while female i dont i just hate you by amanda prestigiacomo november   
as a woman who rejects thirdwave feminism with the burning passion of a thousand suns on a regular basis ive had my fair share of feminists tell me that i only reject them and their ideas because i suffer from internalized misogyny or in other words im a selfloathing sexist 
heres exactly how everyday feminism defines internalized misogyny if youre unfamiliar with bats crazy 
internalized misogyny by definition is sexism turned inward toward ourselves and outward toward other women 
it becomes innate as we are socialized to the norms of our culture that indicate overtly and covertly that women are less than men  less worthy less strong less dependable less able less of a leader less logical  while also more than men more emotional more irrational more complex more to manage 
of course this is ridiculous and i gave such an assertion about as much time as a i would a male feminist hitting on me zero seconds 
but on wednesday i learned that team hillary the political left likewise thought me a selfloathing sexist who passed on my obligation to vote for queen pantsuit because i couldnt stomach the thought of a powerful woman since i apparently believe women are lessers in fact ia woman with a chronic case of internalized misogynycost hillary the election not her decision to engage in potentially criminal activity nor her inability to campaign her way out of a paper bag it was my fault clinton campaign communications director jess_mc on election loss internalized misogyny is a real thing inners httpstcorvtuih  all in wchris hayes allinwithchris november   
yeah no i didnt pull the lever for trump because i hate myself i dont not even a little actually i just hate you 
let me define you 
you are the feminists who contend my uterus must dictate all my choices those who make it their mission to drag down any woman who has the audacity to veer from your ideology one iota 
you are the feminists who tell me that theres a special place in hell for me if i dont cast my ballot for crooked hillary like all of a sudden feminists believe in god and an afterlife lol 
you are the feminists who tell me im super mean and shame women when i point out that bragging about murdering unborn babies is gross and despicable by the way it is gross and despicable  
you are the feminists who demonize men with thinkpieces on how and why we should banish socalled  toxic masculinity  from this world 
you are the feminists who shut men up because of their gender while simultaneously telling me gender is a social construct and no i will not cater to your preferred pronouns you entitled brat protip once the number of genders youve madeup passes the number of flavors at baskin robbins its time to admit you have a problem 
you are the social justice warriors who tell me im a hateful selfish capitalistic pig from your iphone at your local safe space equipped with coloring books bubbles and puppies across from the starbucks you work weekends at 
you are the social justice warriors who viciously riot when you dont get your way meanwhile youre not even registered to vote  
you are the social justice warriors shoutingdown any free speech which doesnt perfectly align with your ideology ironically in the name of tolerance and inclusiveness 
you are the virtuesignaling celebrities who think i give a hoot about your political stance please go ahead and move to canada no one will miss you i certainly wont 
you are the mainstream media so desperate for your leftist narrative that youll lie to the american people to advance it so hellbent on painting middleamerica and republicans as racist youll frame actual policy discussions into a segment of whos the biggest xenophobe republican edition 
you are the leftist telling me im a racist for not supporting the divisive hate group black lives matter first of all its mostly comprised of a bunch of loser white kids second of all call me crazy but once you start calling for and actually assassinating police officers  im out i know how racist of me 
you are leftists calling me an islamophobe because i use the term radical islam and resist an influx of refugees whom the fbi said we cannot properly vet pouring into our country 
you see this election had virtually nothing to do with donald trumpi could take him or leave himand almost everything to do with you the left trump was indeed a protest vote he was a direct repudiation of everything you stand for and everything you tell me i should stand for by virtue of my uterus 
so no im not a selfloathing victim of the patriarchy who passed on a vote for hillary because shes a woman i just hate you",2016-11-17
109,gallup americans more confident in trump since election  daily wire,"media claim trump transition chaos trumps way ahead of schedule by ben shapiro november   
the media desperately in search of a narrative to cast the incoming trump administration as dangerously incompetent are once again overplaying their hands instead of focusing on the nepotistic fact that trump relies heavily on his soninlaw jared kushner and his daughter ivanka  he invited them to a state meeting with japan  theyre trying to claim that he just isnt moving fast enough on appointments 
thats nuts 
barack obama didnt name his picks for secretary of state defense or attorney general until december  nearly a month after the november   election george w bush didnt name his picks for state defense or attorney general until middecember december  for colin powell december  for donald rumsfeld december  for john ashcroft bill clinton didnt name his picks for those positions until at least december  george hw bush was the fastest off the mark  he named james baker secretary of state the day after the november  election ronald reagan waited until december  to get started jimmy carter waited until december  
were still waiting on trumps state and defense picks but hes already out of the gate with senator jeff sessions for attorney general its november  
the media are so eager to bury trumps administration that they are falling all over themselves to do so instead of soberly covering potential problems with top level picks  steve bannon for example is a rotten pick  but not because hes a racist or antisemite  the media keep proclaiming the end is near this sort of alarmism doesnt convince americans who dont really see why theres any giant rush to appoint people who arent going to be formally considered by the senate until january  anyway 
if this election was about repudiation of the media  and it was  the media arent doing themselves any favors when they promulgate factfree narratives while simultaneously attempting to label conservative outlets fake news for years americans have assumed that the leftist media are ladling them fake news each day each day the media seem determined to prove them right tags",2016-11-17

111,the left says i hate myself for voting trump while female i dont i just hate you  daily wire," things you need to know about trump attorney general pick jeff sessions by aaron bandler november   
presidentelect donald trump has announced that his selection for attorney general is sen jeff sessions ral who has long been a favorite of conservatives the democrats already have the long knives out for sessions spitballing their usual accusations of racismwhich should indicate that sessions will be an effective attorney general 
here are seven things you need to know about sessions 
 sessions has a  percent liberty score on conservative review  sessions has been in the senate for  years and has been described by the washington times as a tea partier before the tea party was cool per conservative review s biography  
 sessions has been one of the leaders in the senate in fighting against amnesty for instance sessions was among the most prominent members of the senate leading the opposition to the gang of eight bill national review  which dubbed sessions amnestys worst enemy explained how sessions would reveal true facts about the bill in an attempt to persuade some senators that hadnt decided how to vote on the legislation sessions and sen david vitter rla would find other clever ways to oppose the bill such as an amendment to a resolution honoring the late latino union organizer cesar chavez in which vitter noted chavezs opposition to illegal immigration putting sen bob menendez dnj in an awkward position 
in  sessions introduced a bill that would overhaul the immigration system according to conservative review  overturned the zadvydas v davis supreme court case that obama is using as an excuse to release criminal aliens after six months of detention explicitly deputized the states to enforce federal immigration law eliminated sanctuary cities by cutting off dhs and doj law enforcement grants expedited deportation of gang members applied the ramifications of treating illegal aliens as criminal aliens to those convicted of drunk driving clamped down on loopholes that allow legal immigrants who commit crimes to continue on the path to citizenship instead of getting deported this would address cases like the legal immigrant who murdered the family in the washington dc mansion murders 
sessions has also fought efforts to increase legal immigration as he has railed against it as the primary source of lowwage immigration into the united states 
what we need now is immigration moderation slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together sessions wrote in a  oped in the washington post  
 sessions has also spearheaded efforts to crack down on budgetary issues according to conservative review s biography of sessions 
in january  he was named ranking member of the senate budget committee in this capacity he led the republican charge against majority leader harry reid and barack obama for not offering a serious budget proposal given that the senate had not passed a budget since april  he has fought guerilla warfare often a lonely battle against democrats spending by raising budget point of orders against the breach of budget caps he has even fought his own party when his office put out devastating research against the ryanmurray budget deal sessions has also been a strong leader on welfare reform and publishing studies and data on the extent of the welfare state 
sessions has voted against the tarp bailout stimulus bills and increases to the debt limit and has traveled through his state with charts warning of the united states crippling debt per the washington post  
 sessions endorsed trump early on to the surprise of many in the establishment sessions endorsed trump in february declaring  i believe we are on a movement that must not fade away this is a campaign this is a movement the american people are not happy with their government 
it shouldnt have come as a surprise though given sessions record on immigration and that sessions tends to be more protectionist on trade 
 sessions is wellliked by his senate colleagues on a personal level according to the washington post  
say what you will about him former longtime senate democratic communications aide jim manley told the almanac of american politics he was always nice to the late ted kennedy and other democrats as well 
even people who have run against him have nice things to say about him stanleybecker talked to susan parker a democrat who tried to unseat sessions in  during a debate she asked for a tissue and sessions handed her one she joked she would use it to dry her eyes when sessions made her cry and he responded please dont say that thats my nightmare i promise ill be nice 
its no wonder then that sessions will likely be confirmed by the senate 
 accusations of racism against sessions are absurd when president ronald reagan nominated sessions who at the time was a us attorney to a federal judge the democrats smeared sessions with accusations of racism which included calling a black attorney boy quipping about the ku klux klan i used to think they were ok but they are pot smokers joking that a white attorney was a traitor to his race because he was collaborating with civil rights groups calling the naacp and aclu unamerican prosecuting a civil rights organization for voter fraud 
the last point isnt racist at all the jokes as ben shapiro has written  were made in front of the black lawyer even the lawyer accusing sessions of racism acknowledged that sessions was joking clearly sessions meant them as harmless jokes sessions has also denied calling the lawyer boy the civil rights group sessions prosecuted has faced accusations of voter fraud for many years 
sessions record on race actually shows that he has consistently fought against racism as the weekly standard s mark hemingway writes 
as a us attorney he filed several cases to desegregate schools in alabama and he also prosecuted the head of the state klan henry francis hays for abducting and killing michael donald a black teenager selected at random sessions insisted on the death penalty for hays when he was later elected the state attorney general sessions followed through and made sure the hays executed the successful prosecution of hays also led to a  million civil judgment against the klan effectively breaking the back of the kkk in alabama 
 as attorney general sessions would uphold the rule of law the reason why sessions has been such an immigration hawk is that he supports the rule of law he has also fought against judicial activist nominees and is a strong supporter of the death penalty between that and his legal background as a us attorney and alabama attorney general there is every reason to believe that sessions will follow the law and not politicize the justice department 
his interpretation of the law will not please everyone but i predict it will be fairly applied without fear or favor robert driscoll  former deputy assistant attorney general wrote in national review  clear cases will be prosecuted with vigor creative interpretations of the law may cease but the meatandpotatoes work of the division intentional discrimination police misconduct disability law will continue apace conducted without impropriety or political favoritism that alone will be a breath of fresh air tags",2016-11-17

the democratic congressman who is challenging house minority leader nancy pelosi ohio rep tim ryan threatened a youngstown street fight if donald trump attempts to defund planned parenthood 
speaking with jake tapper on cnns state of the union on sunday ryan intimated that defunding planned parenthood wasnt the only stimulus he would need to launch violence he stated if he tries to defund planned parenthood if he tries to kick people off their health insurance if they try to privatize medicare or cut taxes for the wealthy you know we are going to have a youngstown street fight in the capitol 
youngstown has been plagued by violent street fights in the recent past last may and august violence erupted on the streets of the city 
ryan called trumps infrastructure plan a bunch of smoke and mirrors he added that he didnt blame pelosi for focusing any specific economic issues i cant in good conscience hang this election around nancy pelosis neck of course but moving forward we have to win congressional seats in areas of the country that voted for donald trump even in my district where they voted for me and they voted for donald trump 
ryans campaign to replace pelsoi is picking up steam on sunday new york rep kathleen rice endorsed him stating he has a lot of good ideas but maybe most importantly he also isnt suggesting he has all the answers  he has stressed that he wants these conversations to be ongoing that he wants more voices in the conversation so that we can work together to craft our message and forge a winning strategy rice said in a statement

117,texas officer shot dead outside police hq,"snowflake colbert didnt want to write jokes about trump winning by hank berrien november   
conversing with fellow daily show comic john oliver at the montclair film festival on saturday night late show unfunny host stephen colbert admitted that he couldnt even conceive that donald trump would win the presidency so much so that he couldnt write jokes bout trump winning for election night 
in the roughly twohour discussion and qa titled wow that was weird montclair film festival executive director tom hall set the somber tone by allowing when we planned this evening i think we all thought wed be looking back with laughter instead of looking forward with deep concern about the uncertainty we face 
speaking of the late show s election night special on showtime colbert admitted that the staff was prepared for every result of the election except the one that actually transpired 
there was not a bear big enough in the world that we werent loaded for we were so loaded for every possible eventuality we had so many guests we had so many pretaped pieces all based on a different eventuality we had three shows hillary clinton wins and we know hillary clinton wins and we dont know because its not called before the shows over donald trumps going to win and we dont know because everyone said he had such a narrow path to victory thats not wishful thinking thats what everyone was saying 
and then there was the last show which is the show we did which is donald trump is going to win and we know hes going to win my execs and my writers were like you dont want to write something for that and im like no there is nothing you can write you dont understand i have  people in my theater if we know donald trump is going to win its going to be like doing standup comedy for one of those chilean soccer stadiums where the villagers watch you execute one of the natives there will be no laughter we only did about  minutes of material before we went f it its going to be him lets just talk for another hour so i think we have two and a half whole shows that you will never see of material that we had to kill that night 
colbert moaned that the special was the hardest thing ive ever done in my life adding i was tying my tie at  and i went oh he took ohio oh well we expected that he took it by  points wow thats not expected and then over my guests shoulders people kept holding up signs that said florida iowa nebraska he revealed that numerous fake commercials were prepared but none of them were appropriate once we knew we were playing to an audience of the condemned our audience was sobbing openly and those are people who work for me like my cameramen 
as daily wire editorinchief ben shapiro pointed out years ago  colberts manipulative act has been laced with hatred of conservatives 
he engages in conservativeface he needs no makeup or bulbous appendage to play a conservative  after all conservatives come in every shape and size instead he acts as though he is a conservative  an idiotic racist sexist bigoted brutal conservative he outarchie bunkers archie bunker his audience laughs and scoffs at brutal religious colbert who wishes to persecute gays they chortle at evil sexist colbert who thinks men are victims of sexism this is the purpose of colberts routine his show is about pure hatred for conservatives in the same way that blackface was about pure hatred of blacks in order to justify their racism racists had to create a false perception of blacks in the same way colbert and his audience can justify their racism only by creating a false perception of conservatives 
on saturday night colbert waxed eloquent over his fear of a trump presidency arguing im all for giving him a chance but dont give him an inch because i believed everything he said and i remember everything he said and its horrifying its possible the job changes a man thats the cliche of the presidency he pontificated 
every president tries to achieve what they promised and you can say well there are levers of power in washington that can slow him down but two things one is theyre cowards second is that the levers in washington are apparently merely attached to blinking red lights that make the people happy when they pull because they tried to stop trump everybody tried to stop trump do not delude yourself 
everyone except the people hes going to appoint tried to stop him and they didnt he owes them nothing he goes out on the balcony and he says to the crowd shall i do it and they say yes and he says it shall be so and the balcony is twitter he goes onto twitter and he goes what do you think do you think im right thats what scares me that he owes the checks and balances of washington nothing because they tried to stop him and they couldnt and hes a vindictive person so its all going to be fine merry christmas no there is nothing you can write stephen colbert 
colbert concluded the next person who says to me you must be happy on a certain level is going to have their eye carved out

so soontobeexpresident obama wont be going away anytime soon 
after george w bush left office he essentially went silent he had no criticism for president obama he didnt sound off about mitt romney or donald trump he went away not so for obama it seems that barack obama will follow the jimmy carter pathway to annoyingland hell be commenting whenever possible after acknowledging that bush could not have been more gracious to me when i came in obama said as an american citizen who cares deeply about our country if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle or go to core questions about our values and ideals and if i think that its necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals ill examine it when it comes 
this comes as welcome news for republicans obamas policy unpopularity  and his tendency to lecture from on high to americans in rural areas  means that hell suck all the oxygen out of the room when it comes to criticizing trump and republicans middle americans voted for trump in order to sound off against obamas obvious scorn for them heres what obama had to say about those who didnt vote for trump in todays der spiegel  
if you look at the new generation of americans they reflect the vision that i spoke about theyre diverse they believe in tolerance theyre accepting of things like samesex marriage they believe in integration the problem though is that young people are less likely to vote than older people what results is a situation in which sometimes the elections dont fully reflect the views of the american population essentially the presidentelect was supported by about  percent of the american population one of our challenges historically is that we have very low voting rates even during presidential elections 
this sort of language drove americans to trump and if obama continues to critique trump from the outside with this sort of language not only will he be doing trump a favor hell be preventing any other democrat from taking a leading role in opposing trump hell become the point of resistance for his own party  and his party wont be able to escape his shadow 
obamas ego has already cost his party the presidency the senate the house a bevy of state legislators and governors mansions now it may cost them the future

for some people fishing is a long boring day of sitting and staring endlessly at a rod and reel that may never get a bite but what if you could get down with those mocking waterbreathers and have highnoon shootout with them the way nature intended 
well thats just what some florida boys thought when they decided to take their modified glock mm pistol into the gulf of mexico to help deal with the infestation of lionfish 
thesickest provides some more details on the lionfish overpopulation problem and the boys creative way to address it 
lionfish are an invasive species with no natural predators whos females lay a staggering two million eggs a year the intersection between ammunitionhappy americans and the determent of an overpopulated species is where the the use of this new sporting phenomenon was birthed 
lionsfish were never intended to be in the gulf of mexico and while its speculated that their transplant may be linked to a hurricanes back in the s because of their rapid reproductive nature the waters have become flooded by their presence

swedish democrat party member of parliament anna hagwall has announced her resignation from all party posts and will not stand for reelection in  after a furor following her exposure of the fact that a single family of jews control the swedish media one jewish family helps to brainwash the entire population of sweden this swedish mp has had enough 
the uproar followed her letter to the aftonbladet newspaper in which she said that ethnicity should be a factor in determining media ownership of more than  percentan obvious reference to the jewish bonnier family media group 
the bonnier group owns  book publishers  business and trade press newspapers  digital news platforms  film production companies  magazines  major newspapers  tv stations and  other media outletsand quite literally dominates the controlled media in sweden 
hagwall had earlier submitted a motion to the swedish parliament which proposed cuts to the state subsidies paid to media in sweden 
although she never mentioned jews by name hagwall said in an explanatory letter to the aftonbladet that it would be a good idea to let bonniers newspapers go under so that no family ethnic group or company could control more than  percent of the media 
an entire  percent of the media is owned and controlled by the same owners hagwell wrote this is not acceptable therefore media ownership should be spread over many independent companies and people in order to change this i suggest press subsidies only for the independent media 
when asked by aftonbladet how the abolition of press subsidies to the countrys local newspapers reduce bonniers power over the media in sweden hagwall answered by email that most small newspapers are directly or indirectly controlled by bonnier and why they have to be subsidized by the swedish taxpayer is a mystery 
let the little bonnier newspapers in the provinces go under because then a void will be created which can be filled by newspapers that care about people and business owners 
she also said that the swedish public service broadcaster sveriges television svt should be switched to pay channels to reduce svts propagation of the politically correct agenda 
the comments provoked a stream of attacks upon hagwall and the swedish democrat leadership also distanced itself from her saying in a statement that the matter will affect her future in the party 
this week hagwall resigned her position as member of the parliamentary committee on taxation and internal group leader of the sweden democrats tax policy group she also will not seek reelection to parliament in  at the request of the party leadership and it is currently unclear if she will continue to sit in parliament for the remainder of the current term",2016-11-23

here is a sufi story that addresses the very same concept but in a different manner that of strength as opposed to what is typically perceived as weakness dont just read the story reflect on it extend it out in your mind and see where it takes you in that search you will discover issues within yourself that must be addressed 
there once was a sufi master who was a soldier 
during a protracted war he was at one point engaged in fierce mortal combat in the thick of furious battle he finally overcame a vicious determined foe besting the enemy and driving him to ground the sufi closed in for the kill 
at the very moment he was about to deliver a fatal thrust of his sword to the neck of his prostrate enemy his foe cried out in anguish ah if only i had your sword for a single moment how different things would be 
at once the sufi stopped his attack and surrendered his sword to his fallen enemy 
the soldier was dumbfounded 
taking the sword from the sufi he said why did you do this you could have killed me i was lost and now you stop and present me with your sword why would you do such a stupid thing  for it is now i who will kill you  
the sufi shrugged i come from a family that grants any request no matter how great he replied cooly you asked for my sword i am honor bound to fulfill your request 
the fallen soldier rose and recognizing the sufi as a perfected master returned his sword to him falling at the feet of the man who had just spared his life he asked to become his disciple 
from that day forth he followed the sufi as his master like this share it now",2016-11-23

136,clinton policy on syria would lead to ww iii trump,"clintons nofly zone over syria will lead to war with russia warning of jcs chairman general dunford october   at  am global research  october   the media has failed to address the confrontation between the us state department and the joint chiefs of staff 
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general joseph francis dunford image right has warned both the us senate as well secretary of state john kerry in no uncertain terms that a no fly zone over syria would lead to war with both syria and russia intimating a dangerous process of military escalation 
in a senate arms services committee hearing dunford said responding to questions from republican senator roger whicker mississippi 
right now senator for us to control all of the airspace in syria it would require us to go to war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make  senate armed services committee september   emphasis added 
at the third presidential debate hillary clinton reasserted her commitment that if elected president she would implement a noflyzone intimating that the objective was to save lives 
i think a nofly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict i am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general clinton said in response to a question from fox news debate moderator chris wallace 
this would not be done just on the first day this would take a lot of negotiation and would also take making it clear to the russians and syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground  i think we could strike a deal and make it clear to the russians and the syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interest of the people on the ground in syria fox news emphasis added 
at present under the obama administration the joint chiefs of staff are opposed to the no fly zone 
the joint chiefs of staff are appointed by the secretary of defense 
under a clinton presidency a new secretary of defense as well as a new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff firmly committed to a no fly zone over syria would be appointed 
michèle angelique flournoy a former under secretary of defense for policy is hillarys choice for the position of secretary of defense who favors the no fly zone option 
according to defense one the woman expected to run the pentagon under hillary clinton said she would direct us troops to push president bashar alassads forces out of southern syria and would send more american boots to fight the islamic state in the region 
confirmed by the leaked emails michele flournoy is a crony of the clintons she has called for limited military coercion to help remove assad from power in syria including a no bombing zone over parts of syria held by usbacked rebels this is tantamount to a no fly zone to protect the terrorists including isis daesh from actions by syrian and russian forces 
according to defense one flournoy and several of her colleagues at the center for new american security or cnas have been making the case for sending more american troops into combat against isis and the assad regime than the obama administration has been willing to commit
since russias increased involvement the facts on the ground in syria she said do not support the kind of negotiated conditions we would like to get to us policy should be the removal of assad even if that meant using limited military coercion flournoy said at mondays annual cnas conference in washington 
flournoy did not deny the entire report that she favors increased us intervention for instance she acknowledged her support for us strikes using standoff weapons  to retaliate against syrian military targets to enforce the nobomb zone 
the press reports however did not quote the details of the discussion and testimony of general dunford and secretary of defense carter at the arms services committee hearing let me see if the chairman wants to add anything
senator wicker well let me just ask this if you dont mind secretary carter it would help if the barrel bombing ended and i spoke to a democratic colleague of mine today ive been calling for a nofly zone to stop the barrel bombing and i asked this colleague of mine on the other side of the aisle if he would support that and he said yes he said i want to call it something else rather than a nofly zone but that this particular senator it is a fact that this particular senator has now changed his position and would like us to take action to present  to prevent the barrel bombing 
what is your position about that and wouldnt it help if we took decisive action and ended this carnage 
secretary carter i dont know the specific proposal which youre discussing with your colleague ill make one comment and see if the chairman wants to add anything 
senator wicker i think he was talking about a nofly zone  
secretary carter well okay 
senator wicker  but described in more palatable terms 
secretary carter there are  a number of different proposals have been made but i  the one that i think it the focus on right now is the one secretary kerrys trying to promote namely a nofly zone for the russians and the syrians who are attacking the syrian people if theyre talking about a nofly zone for american aircraft fighting isil needless to say that  thats not going to get any enthusiasm get strong opposition from me 
senator wicker im speaking about a  
secretary carter but i think thats what a  but  its not called that but secretary kerry is trying to get a standdown of the syrian and russian air force and if hes successful that would be a good thing 
let me ask the chairman if he has anything to add 
general dunford senator the only thing id say is you know as the situation on the ground changes i think i have a responsibility  we the joint force has a responsibility  to make sure the president has a full range of options we have discussed that issue in the past under certain conditions the conditions on the ground will change and well continue to look at those options and make sure theyre available to the president 
senator wicker what about the option of controlling the airspace so that barrel bombs cannot be dropped 
general dunford all options  
senator wicker what do you think of that option sir 
general dunford right now senator for all of the airspace in syria it would require war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make 

concluding remarks 
from the above testimonies and statements one thing is clear decisionmakers at highest levels of the us government and the military believe in their own propaganda they are not able to reflect on their actions outside the realm of propaganda and this also applies to nuclear warfare which is presented as a peacemaking operation 
it is unlikely that any drastic action regarding a no fly zone will be taken under the obama administration prior to the november elections and the instatement of a new president of the us in january  
consequently the next three months will be absolutely crucial for syria ie during this period the counterterrorism campaign waged by syria with the support of russia and iran will seek to eliminate remaining terrorist pockets and pacify the entire country 
the footsoldiers of the western military alliance will be defeated on the ground if this objective is achieved it will inevitably have an impact on us options regarding the proposed deployment of groundforces and the no fly zone what prevails however is an attempt on the part of washington to redeploy its isis terrorist footsoldiers in mosul by transferring them from iraq to syria the original source of this article is global research",2016-10-27

138,dr duke and dr macdonald call for prosecution of hillary for treasonous support of isis,"how they could steal the election from trump even if he is announced the winner next tuesday october   at  am 
how they could steal the election from trump even if he is announced the winner next tuesday 
by dr patrick slattery  there has been a great deal of talk recently about the rigging of elections trump talks about it and then the media accuses him of being a threat to democracy by refusing to accept the will of the voters nobody asks hillary if she will accept the will of the voters 
of course we know that our electoral system is unfair biased and even rigged at a variety of levels without going into detail the media which plays an absolutely crucial role in staging our elections has abandoned even the pretense of neutrality ballot access is unfair campaign finance is corrupt electronic voting machines are vulnerable voting by foreigners and dead people exists as does multiple voting by individuals 
but one massive threat has so far gone completely unmentioned the vulnerability of the electoral college to postelection shenanigans 
what people are not aware of is that under the constitution the president is not elected on november  the tuesday after the first monday in november is designated for congressional elections it just so happens that over the years all the states decided to have their electors to the electoral college selected by the voters on that day in the early days of the republic it was actually more common for state legislatures to select the electors and the constitution allows the state legislatures to determine how the electors are selected 
it is actually the electoral college that elects the president and that happens on the monday after the second wednesday in december which this year will be december  on this day the electors will meet in their respective state capitals to cast their ballots which will then be sent to washington to be opened by vice president biden before a joint session of congress on january  of next year some of you may remember the scene from michael moores fahrenheit  showing vice president gore reading votes that elected president bush ironically denying the objections raised by some congressmen to floridas electoral votes which bush won over gore amidst the greatest of controversy 
so if this system is enshrined in the constitution what could possibly go wrong plenty 
unless hillary goes into complete meltdown over the next week a trump victory on november  will likely be a narrow one in terms of the electoral college map one very plausible scenario has trump losing pennsylvania but winning the rest of the main battleground states plus one of maines congressional districts maine along with nebraska allow for electors to be elected on a congressional district basis rather than winnertakeall under this scenario  republican electors would be elected a bare majority while  democrat electors would be elected 
notice i did not say trump would get  electoral votes which is what we are used to hearing the fact is that the electoral votes are not cast until december  and there is no guarantee that every single one of the  republican electors would actually vote for trump do you remember a few months ago how alarmed we were at the prospect of supposed trump delegates to the republican national convention deserting trump and voting for cruz it was only that trump piled up such large victories in the final primaries that he had big enough majority of delegates to cause the never trump people in the republican establishment to give up on rigging the convention 
so who are these electors just as the method of electing the electors is left up to the states the method for nominating the candidates for the electoral college is also left up to the states some states allow the presidential candidates to nominate their own slate of electors presumably these people could be counted on to be loyal but in other states the partys slate of electors is chosen at state party conventions and even electoral district conventions 
as a young man i attended one such convention and had my name put into nomination as a democratic elector myself and the other three contenders then made short speeches to the convention the other three talked about being precinct captains or hardworking party volunteers then i gave a speech calling for the direct election of the president and the abolition of the electoral college i got a huge round of applause i would have easily won but as a matter of principle i withdrew my name from nomination 
the point of the story is that most of the electors are unknown to the public typically cogs in the party apparatus and not even necessarily highlevel ones and some of them may even be smoothtalking slicksters like me unknown to the party itself 
so how likely is it that one or more republican electors would betray trump such a person is known as a faithless elector and while faithless electors have never ultimately altered the outcome of a presidential election there have been  faithless electors in our history in fact faithless electors caused the congress to have to decide the  election for vice president 
it is true that about half the states have laws punishing faithless voters but in all but a few states the votes of faithless electors would still count 
the nightmare situation would be after a close election the hillary people or the never trump people could bribe or pressure republican electors some of whom may not like trump anyway not to vote for trump they could vote for hillary they could vote for pence they could vote for anyone else or they could even abstain from voting 
then what happens if enough republican electors are cajoled into voting for hillary in the above  scenario it would only require two then hillary gets inaugurated on january  if its a tie then the house of representatives breaks the tie obviously there have been republican members of the house that say they wont vote for trump for president in november so there is no reason to assume they would vote for him in january 
however not only are republicans likely to retain a significant majority in the house but the voting for president by the house is not one vote for each representative but one vote per state this means that california which currently has  democratic representatives would get only one vote while alaskas single representative who is a republican would also get one vote this heavily favors the republicans and means that if hillary cannot flip enough republican electors to herself to win a majority of the electoral votes she is finished there is no real prospect of the house of representative electing hillary 
but what if enough republican electors vote for other people paul ryan for example so that no candidate gets a majority then the house of representatives gets to choose between the top three vote finishers in the electoral college vote you could get a coalition between democrats and republican defectors that would deny trump the presidency and give it to someone like ryan the same applies in the case that mormon excia operative and nevertrump independent presidential candidate evan mcmullen wins utah  which some polls predict is possible 
while none of the above scenarios may come to pass we do have to face the fact that the establishment has so far stopped at nothing to try to defeat trump and so it is not too far fetched to think that they would try these tactics especially if the november  voting produces a very narrow victory for trump the media could start inventing more reasons why trump is uniquely unfit to become president and claim that the constitution allows for these scenarios which is the case and that this in fact was why the framers of the constitution created the electoral college which is not the case 
it would then be incumbent on us to make it clear to the members of the electoral college and the congress that any violation of the peoples will would not be tolerated",2016-10-27

148,after debate duke says usa becoming banana republic,"david brooks whites are voting their gene pool after being ruined by globalization immigration and feminism november   at  am by dr patrick slattery 
on the pbs news hour on friday david brooks said white people are voting their gene pool wow just wow this is the same david brooks who wrote in his new york times column about a jewish woman who came up to him after a speech and knowing that he was jewish too told him that his speech was a description of how jews had taken over america which he acknowledged in the column was indeed the caseone of my jewish professors once boasted that jews earn like episcopalians but vote like puerto ricans in other words they voted their gene pool of course they eventually bought out the republican party as well which gave their gene pools vote a choice
blacks famously vote their gene pool hispanics are expected to vote their gene pool but when whites and whites alone consider their ethnic interests in voting it is something that brooks and the rest of the zio elite and their goyish lackey find deplorable 
basically less educated or high schooleducated whites are going to trump it doesnt matter what the guy does and collegeeducated going to clinton 
sometimes you get the sense that the campaign barely matters people are just going with their gene pool and whatever it is and that is one of the more depressing aspects of this race for me 
but what brooks said about the reasons for whites besides the collegeindoctrinated whites voting their gene pool was even more interesting 
we had a lot of good things over the years that were really good for america i think globalization has been really good for america i think the influx of immigrants has been really good for america feminism has been really good for america 
but there are a lot of people who used to be up in society because of those three good things are now down a lot of high schooleducated white guys and they have been displaced 
when david brooks was growing up whites make up close to  of the american population so it doesnt really make sense to say that the displacement of the bulk of the american population is good for america 
of course he did specify high schooleducated white guys well were blacks helped by globalization immigration and feminism what did that do for their employment rates crime rates illegitimacy rates etc 
and white women well maybe all they ever wanted in the first place was to have blue hair nose rings tattoos and raise cats instead of babies i guess we never asked them 
and college educated white guys well they used to go to harvard and yale now with affirmative action for blacks and hispanics competition from asians and massive jewish nepotism a white guy is lucky to get into a secondtier state school 
brooks conclusion was even more breath taking 
and shame on us for not paying attention to that and helping them out and therefore as a result what happened was they were alienated they got super cynical because they really were being shafted and so they react in an angry way 
well thats not a shock given the last  or  years of american history and so for us going forward its to not reverse the dynamism of american society and the diversity its to pay attention to the people who are being ruined by it and so this doesnt happen again 
here he admits that whites got shafted that we are being ruined by diversity but the weird thing is that line about so this doesnt happen again what is he concerned that hispanics might be jewed out of the america they inherit from whites 
the rest of his appearance was just a poetic rant against donald trump with any luck on tuesday trump will be elected president and we can make begin the process of making america america again",2016-11-03

today dr duke focused on the threat of jews infiltrating and taking over movements with a potential to become a base for opposing jewish power the altright currently includes people who are extremely critical of jewish power and those who either ignore it or downplay it we must be wary of establishment efforts to parachute leaders into our movement who would focus attention away from the jewish issue whether it be milo or alex jones 
dr slattery joined the show and recounted how jews created a culture of self criticism in the s among whites and then used the resulting environment to push through an immigration act that fundamentally transformed the demographics of the country to the extent that it took a miracle for whites simply to elect the president of their choice

160,david duke on cnn," views share 
dr david duke offers a new paradigm for humanity read and listen to this amazing statement that will create a revolution in the concept of human rights a recognition of the absolute right of every people to preserve its human diversity independence and freedom the right of every people to preserve its culture traditions art forms and characteristics of society 
a path to peace and harmonious nations and societies why we must resist globalist destruction of freedom globalist forms of economic and financial slavery and globalist zionist wars 
in the power of its reason love and understanding this declaration of human diversity and freedom can be the moral engine to saving our european heritage and truly the rights of every people on earth the foundation of human freedom 
i believe that each of us must be committed to the preservation of human diversity i cherish not only the value of every form of life on earth in what we call biodiversity but also respect and honor the diversity of mankind i believe that every people has the right to preserve their expression of humanity its own heritage and culture that every people on earth has the right rule themselves and the right to be free and independent 
human freedom is the principle that all peoples must be free to be different humanity is not one it is many destroying the variety diversity and freedom of a diverse humanity is a destruction of humanity itself 
not recognizing the inborn urge of every people to express their essence in their own forms of art music culture religion societal structure and government leads to human conflict and often to violence and human suffering on a horrific scale 
much of the worlds conflicts are not because peoples and cultures are different but because they are not allowed to be different because globalists and imperialists seek to expand their empires they want to control the resources and economy of all nations and destroy real human diversity human differences in values cultures economies religions and their freedom and independence to preserve and celebrated those differences stand in the way of the globalists who want to regiment mankind and make them soulless consumers human diversity is natural 
human life is expressed in a multitude of diverse peoples created by geographic and social adaption over the course of thousands of years whether we celebrate human diversity as the handiwork of nature or in a religious sense as the creation of god we celebrate the rich tapestry of different peoples and cultures across the earth 
we believe that every people and culture has the right to preserve its unique expression of humanity that every people has the right to maintain and enrich its unique culture to nurture its particular expressions of art music literature philosophies architecture religion diet traditions and values that make every people unique and add beauty and possibility for mankind 
we believe that every people has the right to be politically free and independent and not be ruled over or exploited by any other people or nation and we reject the globalist power that seeks to destroy the independence and freedom of every people and destroy human diversity every people must have the right to self preservation and freedom 
we believe that every free people has the right to live in a harmonious society created in its own image its own nature and spirit 
for example the people of tibet have the human right to live in a society oriented to the heritage culture and tradition of that nation as should all peoples today the tibetan people are threatened by massive nontibetan immigration forced by an imperial power meant to marginalize the heritage and culture of tibetan people in their own homeland the loss of the unique people and culture of tibet is a horrific loss for them and truly a loss for all of humanity what is true for tibet and the tibetan people is true for every people on earth we believe that the people of tibet and every nation have the right to defend their borders and an inherent human right to preserve its unique ethnic and cultural character and its freedom and independence 
nations more similar in their cultural ethnic religious and social traditions are tend to be far more harmonious that those wracked with internal cultural ethnic or religious divisions 
we also affirm that states with significant ethnic and cultural minorities tend to be more happy peaceful and cooperative when each group has the freedom to an autonomy that makes each group feel more at home in society 
if one looks honestly at the world he quickly recognizes that the greatest source of civil conflict hatreds wars genocide and other horrific human rights violations comes from ethnic conflict often accompanied by religious conflict and when that happens it is like putting a fuse into dynamite 
it is a truism that if you want to reduce ethnic conflict you must endeavor to give every people the human right to live and to create society and community in its own values and that every group respect the right of every other group to do this 
we believe that these endemic conflicts are rooted in supranational states and globalist denial of the reality of human diversity and denial of the natural human desire of people to live in a society reflecting their own heritage traditions culture and values one size does not fit all 
instead of recognizing this reality the globalists and empire builders seek to destroy the distinctions of humanity so they will become more compliant to their control and exploitation instead of accepting the reality of human nature and truly the diversity of all life including human life the globalists continue to promote destructive policies that destroy the harmony of traditional societies and historical character of nations massive immigration of diverse peoples into another peoples living space produces conflict not harmony 
we believe that massive forced immigration of nonindigenous people into other peoples lands is almost always against the will of the indigenous people 
and this leads to civil repression conflict hatreds violence one does not have to look much further than the palestinian nakba or the massive immigration into tibet as examples of this universal truth but this reality is just as true in europe and other areas of the world that have undergone massive immigration into it regions and nation states 
look at the riots and deep social unrest and conflict that have befallen traditional harmonious societies that have experienced massive unwanted immigration 
a world of independent cultures is true diversity and freedom 
a multicultural state does not contribute to human diversity it does not contribute to human happiness peace and harmony it more often than not lessens human love and human rights no matter what the high motive it produces more disharmony than harmony more discord than accord 
just as in the natural world every life form needs its own living space and needs the preservation of its own ecosystem to survive and flourish so it is true for every people of humanity 
every people needs a living space and ecocultural system in which it can thrive ignoring this reality leads to conflict diverse human peoples and cultures and religions competing in a limited living space is the greatest single cause of civil war and crimes against humanity 
united nations studies show ethnic cultural and religious conflicts within nations are the primary engines of civil conflict and war which takes an enormous toll in human suffering numbering hundreds of millions of dead injured and dispossessed human beings 
this urge to diversity has always been in mankind and always will be not to recognize this elemental part of mankinds nature is the progenitor of conflict 
in fact with the rise of the idea that people have the right to be free ethnic conflict is increasing as the imperial states created by conquest can no longer repress the desire of diverse people for their freedom and ethnic expression 
nations whose rulers have established immigration policies ignoring human differences are increasingly divided and conflicted trying to change the natural urge toward freedom is like screaming against the tide 
the global elite in government and media which has a huge stake in trying to regiment the worlds populations tell us we are all the same and they endeavor to destroy every unique culture and human expression  
they attempt to change human nature but history and an increasingly conflicted world show that this is like screaming against the tide 
better to recognize human nature and within that context support national and regional freedom that lessons conflict and supports mutual respect 
it is time to teach the new ethic that recognizes the human right of every people to exist and thrive however those who seek their own peoples freedom must understand that these rights must be afforded to every people and any effort toward this worthy goal must be in the spirit of not destroying the rights of others and to peaceful resolution of the conflicts 
it is far better to recognize these realities and inherent desires of humanity and avoid as much human conflict as possible than to try to destroy human distinctions in pursuit of imperialist empire or globalist regimentation and conformity even if the destruction of peoples is based on a utopian vision because it goes against basic human nature it ultimately leads not to a dreamed of peace and love between people but to conflict and hate attempts to control exploit or harm any people is a crime against humanity 
we must condemn violence and the harming or destruction of any people we must adopt a clear human ethic that attempts to control or exploit any other nation or people is a crime against humanity 
we support human freedom and we support human diversity and we support the right of every people to have their own nation or society but we do not support supremacism control or repression of any other people efforts to control or exploit is a crime against humanity 
as a person of european descent i see that much of the repressive globalism damaging the world originates in mostly european peopled nations that are today called the west i see that this globalism not only damages and harms the worlds diversity of peoples but that it harms my own people and i have learned that we must not allow this exploitation of our own heritage and be just as committed to the well being of all of humanity 
this is a lifechanging lesson that i have learned in my own life as a very young man i joined a nonviolent klan organization in my community like so many young people across the world i longed to identify with my own people to defend the heritage that i love and that i believed was threatened 
but still as a young man i left the organization because i came to realize i have no moral right to speak about human rights for my own people unless i embrace the idea of the same human rights for every people and further that we must be committed to securing human rights not with war not with violence not with human suppression but the power of human ideas and ideals 
i believe that the vast majority of the earths people believe in the principles i set forth here in my own life i further realized that other peoples have the same the desires for their own peoples heritage and rights that i have for mine 
i realize fully that only in a context of genuine commitment to respect the rights and freedoms of all humanity can one morally campaign for your own peoples fundamental rights defending the diversity of humanity is a defense of humanity itself 
there is nothing wrong with a people defending their own rights and heritage in fact defending and preserving the diversity of humanity is defense of humanity itself 
but it must come with a genuine concern for the rights and heritage of all 
in that context and only with that understanding can we move toward peaceful resolutions of social religious and ethnic conflicts and at the same time preserve our own heritage and the diversity and freedom of humanity 
nations that have an overwhelmingly unifying heritage culture religious and social tradition have the right to preserve their expression of humanity and their societal harmony 
it is a crime to destroy those values in pursuit of socalled multiculturalism and if one wants to see where massive immigration of alien peoples cultures and religions lead just look to what happened in the warravaged now dismembered nation once called yugoslavia look to the cultural and ethnic genocide in tibet look to the tribal and religious conflicts in many nations of the mideast 
group differences run deep even though the muslim quran repeatedly teaches muslim unity still some extremist elements of shiites and sunnis blow up the children of each other in the others holy places of worship nor did the admonitions of jesus christ against violence and for love and reconciliation stop irish catholics and scottishderived protestants from a cascade of violence that has lead to the death of countless innocents 
although we understand the historical motives of mass immigration of one people into another peoples lands we must not continue to repeat those mistakes in the modern world and create more divided and strifetorn communities regions and nations models of self rule and societal harmony 
and just as a majority has the human right to live in a social fabric in harmony with its history and values so minorities must be accorded their human right to have their own communities or regions that reflect their own essence or helped to migrate to a sovereign region of compatriots 
this is human freedom and this is human rights on the most fundamental level those nations with significant minorities of diverse people should strive toward recognizing their desire for freedom and self expression 
autonomy within nations such as the german language speaking south tyrol region of north italy and the italian french and germanspeaking cantons of switzerland offer models of how recognition of differences in language heritage ethnicity and a liberal degree of autonomy can lead to a more peaceful national fabric 
nation states that seek imperial power through the conquering and subjection of other peoples are now coming apart at the seams because of the inherent will to freedom and identity that grow in suppressed people 
even european nations divided by slight differences in history identity genetics and culture seek this freedom the artificially created nation of czechoslovakia was composed of czechs and slovaks held together by  years of intense totalitarian physical suppression propaganda and conditioning 
when the communist tyranny collapsed they used their new freedom to create the independent states of the czech republic and the slovak republic 
they did this with mutual respect and not war and without horrific crimes against humanity 
contrast that to the artificially created state of yugoslavia created in name of empire and then held together under a ruthless authoritarian regime when communism fell people wedded to old ideas of empire tried desperately to hold on to control over vast areas of diverse peoples as a result a long war and brutality and massive crimes against humanity occurred on both sides of the conflict 
how much better if all parties in the conflict had embraced the ethic that all people have a right to self rule and self expression in their own regions take for example two of the many peoples trapped in the old yugoslavia the serbians and the croatians even though serbians may have dominated the government of yugoslavia to effectively control other peoples such a totalitarian state must suppress the natural differences in people and force a regimentation and conformity 
so even the serbian people lost some of their unique identity as well as the other peoples over whom they ruled people now warmly embrace the right of serbians and croatians to be themselves and rule themselves globalism is a continuation of yugoslavian totalitarianism on a global scale 
ironically the serbians and the croatians and indeed all of us face globalist tyrants demanding to control the economy of serbia and croatia their currencies controlled by new york and london rather than by their own people and increasingly they are subject to a media controlled by hollywood and new york rather than the spirit of their own traditional heritage and values 
and in the height of insanity the globalists are eyeing mass immigration into both serbia and croatia of massive numbers of noneuropean immigrants who are far more fundamentally different than serbs and croats a prescription for future human conflict the rights of both majorities and minorities 
there are many harmonious nations on earth that are overwhelmingly of one primary heritage with only minor differences among their inhabitants 
but nations corrupted by the globalist power and media elite and propagandized that humanity is one and not many go against the peoples will and usher in massive immigration of an alien population 
this process is almost always against the democratic will of the nations inhabitants as history repeatedly shows and then as the numbers increase and societal differences and conflicts and discord increase the globalists resort to the old totalitarian tactics of suppressing free speech free association and all kinds of human liberty even to the point of forbidding the public displays of the traditional culture of the vast majority 
a powerful example is how the american government has now made it illegal to display a christian christmas motif on public ground even in an overwhelmingly christian cultural nation america supposedly created by e pluribus unum out of the many one is now dominated by identity and ethnic politics 
the most powerful lobby in american politics by far is for instance the jewish lobby comprised of an ethnic group of two percent of the american people but driven by ethnic and religious supremacism jewish organizations lead the fight in the destruction of christian christmas traditions 
the political landscape of america is dominated by special interest groups to which every politician must now bow except of course the european american majority which must silently watch as its cultural traditions such as christmas are destroyed of course it goes far beyond christmas americans are experiencing increasing identity politics and division such as generated by massive illegal immigration the rights of small nations cannot be sacrificed 
on the international level it must be recognized as a crime against humanity for any imperial state to occupy another peoples lands for exploitation of its labor or resources where autonomy or independent regions are not possible a degree of autonomy is certainly possible where significant groups in an area can have community institutions schools and other structures oriented toward both their needs and their spirit 
it is time to stand for freedom for all peoples it is time to stand up to globalist destruction of biodiversity destruction of human diversity destruction of the earths indigenous cultures artistic expressions lifestyles traditions and independence zionist globalism is actually supremacism 
the globalists seek the destruction of every unique expression of humanity they want to destroy the unique character of your people and every people on the earth 
they seek to destroy the human diversity of the earth so they can more easily rule over all of us and market the same brands of junk movies media and music they want you and all of us to consume the same junk food from a world agribusiness and media that advertises it that not only destroys the planets ecosystems but destroys your health and the health of hundreds of millions of people spawning epidemics of obesity heart disease diabetes and other ills 
they want to control the value of the currency in your pocket and force you and your nation under a corrupt zionistcontrolled global banking system that exploits you and all of us and put whole nations and peoples as slaves in a perpetual debt 
they want to put you and all of us under a soulless globalist government that takes away your freedom and that of every people and every nation 
and these globalists want war perpetual wars and conflicts in their attempts to expand their power over the earth and over all people 
they grow stronger by divide and conquer tactics and they seek to stamp out human diversity and seek to regiment all of humanity to their new world order all while the new york centered globalist media supports israel as a quote jewish state and supports zionist control of the international banks and the globalist media so in reality zionistdriven globalism is actually form of jewish supremacism 
globalism is imperialism on a global level and the greatest threat to human freedom diversity and independence in all of world history yes to freedom yes to diversity and independence 
but my dear friends all over the world in my homeland of america and that of my brethren in europe but among all freedom loving people across the globe millions of us say no to globalism 
we say yes to freedom yes to human diversity and independence 
we say no to globalist wars such as the iraq war the afghanistan war the planned war on iran horrific wars that are part of the zionist globalist agenda 
we say no to the zionist dominated globalist media that spout the lies that fuel these wars 
we say yes to a free internet and the freedom of people create their own media literature music and art forms no longer will we drink the toxic poisons of the globalist elite 
we say no to globalism yes to human freedom yes to human diversity yes to world of peace and prosperity 
we say yes to every peoples striving to preserve their way of life their particular heritage their particular expression of humanity 
whether we are kurds or pakistanis or iranians or palestinians whether we are chinese or japanese or africans or indians or of european heritage we say no to globalism 
we say yes to human freedom and global diversity we say yes to the peoples of our own nations and societies determining our destiny 
we say no to the global corporations and huge imperial powers wiping out human diversity in pursuit of their ungodly power we say yes to preserving our heritage and our way of life yes to our independence and freedom no matter who we are or where we live upon the earth 
we are humanity we are many 
because we honor our own heritage and traditions we honor every heritage and tradition 
because we value our own freedom and independence we value the freedom and independence of every people on earth 
because we refuse to be economically exploited we pledge not to exploit other s 
just as most europeans now want to preserve their own heritage and cultures we refuse to support the globalists who seek to use us to control and exploit other nations around the world 
because we love peace we refuse to support their zionistdriven globalist wars a new paradigm of human rights 
this is a new affirmation of human rights a new paradigm it is the human freedom movement and it is found wherever there are free people who desire to preserve their heritage and freedom 
it is found where people yearn for human societies allowed to be as naturally diverse as the biodiversity in nature 
the globalists have global economic media political and military power but we represent the true desires of humanity for freedom 
we represent the natural desires of every majority population to want to preserve the character of their nation and people and every minority population who seeks more freedom and autonomy in their own communities or regions human diversity freedom and independence 
we must resist rule of the globalists over us with a global coalition of mutually free peoples 
we are rising in every nation 
our paradigm for human freedom and diversity is growing among people all over the world 
the globalists cannot rule over us without our consent they cannot defeat us if we rise in defense of human freedom and diversity not just for ourselves but as a new principle for all mankind good for all people on this planet 
the principles we stand for we hold for our own people and for every people on the face the earth 
this is the world i am committed to the humanity i am committed to the nation in my own land that i am committed to 
i hope you join me in this quest for a new paradigm for humanity a new commitment to human freedom and diversity

rev dankof quoted an article by former reagan administration assistant treasury secretary paul craig roberts that goes farther than he has ever done before in identifying the jewish nature of the power establishment in america the very same establishment that is fighting presidentelect trump tooth and nail there seems to be the start of a sea change in which people are becoming more willing to point out that the emperor has no clothes

164,slattery and dankof we won now what,"editorial by dr david duke  
trump appoints men who will take america back 
presidentelect donald trumps appointment of bannon flynn and sessions are the first steps in the long and arduous project of taking america back 
trump chief strategist bannon has repeatedly exposed the vicious war on white people on his breitbart website 
national security head flynn realizes that americas foreign policy has been downright traitorous with the support of the radical jihadists of saudi arabia over our natural allies the christian muslim and moderate secularists of syria he also understands that putin of christian russia should not be our enemy but our ally he is an avowed enemy of the jewish warmonger traitors called neocons and they in turn intensely hate this us army general who truly puts america first 
attorney general sessions has been hated for years by the jewishdominated media for his opposition to massive immigration into america and for the fact that he has dared to publicly oppose the massive institutionalized racial discrimination against white people called affirmative action 
during his us senate confirmation hearings senators should demand that he expose the blatant media and political blather of equal rights and opportunity when white people face massive racial discrimination as well as a media hate campaign against the people whose ancestors created america

165,dr duke and pastor dankof quote jews boasting of jewish media power," views share by dr david duke when i was first began to understand the ultraracist supremacist ideology of judaism and zionism i came into contact with the theory that presentday jews are genetically unrelated to the historical jewish community the allegation known as the khazar theory claims that the ashkenazim jews of today are actually the descendants of the khazar people a central asiatic nomadic tribe that allegedly converted to judaism in the th century ad it is claimed that these newlyminted jews then migrated into what is now russia eastern europe and later western and northern europe the theory is also used to advance the idea that jewish actions are character are not genetic or racial because the khazar people adopted the talmudic values of shephardic and other jews who were unrelated to them interestingly enough the khazar theory was launched and is still to this day driven primarily by communist jews and other jews who promote it in the gentile community as a refutation that the jews cant be racist because they are not a race it is ironic that the three most prominent exponents of the theory that the jews are not a race all have almost exaggerated caricatures of features people ascribe as jewish above left to right zionist extremist and communist party member arthur koestler author of the the thirteenth tribe jewish geneticist eran elhaik and shlomo sand an israeli academic and former member of the union of israeli communist youth banki all three maintain that large numbers of presentday jews are completely genetically unrelated to the middle easternorigin jews who wrote the babylonian talmud 
for years i accepted the khazar theory as true after it all it was repeated by some writers who also recognized the leading jewish role in communism and their leadership in many other subversive movements it was only later when i considered the question logically and scientifically were my doubts about the khazar theory aroused one thing that i did not know then was that koestler the communist jew who popularized the khazar theory bragged in a jewish magazine that he advanced the theory as way to fight against antisemitism his theory was that since the gospels and europeans blamed jews for the crucifixion of jesus christ if he could make europeans believe that they are not related by blood to the christkiller jews talked about in the new testament that he could lessen hatred against jews one must remember until the jewish triumph of christian zionism  percent of christianity viewed jews as the greatest enemies of jesus christ and god as the new testament makes very very clear so in those days some jews such as koestler saw an advantage to say that the jews were not actually related to the jews who crucified christ and so persecuted christians koestlers official biography written by michael scammell specifically quotes him on why he wrote the thirteenth tribe  his argument was that if he could persuade people that a nonjewish khazar heritage formed the basis of modern jews then this would be a weapon against european raciallybased antisemitism should this theory be confirmed the term antisemitism would become void of meaning he said according to scammell koestler told french biologist pierre debrayritzen he was convinced that if he could prove that the bulk of eastern european jews were descended from the khazars the racial basis for antisemitism would be removed and antisemitism itself could disappear source scammell michael koestler the literary and political odyssey of a twentiethcentury skeptic random house  isbn  p  in the s the khazar theory was also promoted by benjamin friedman a prominent rich jew who converted to christianity and turned against the jews it was certainly selfserving for him to promote the idea that jewishness was mostly cultural and religious and not racial in nature therefore facilitating more acceptance of him there are three fundamental issues which need to addressed the scientific evidence thehistoricallogical evidence and the reasons why the khazar theory came about part i the scientific evidencetwelve dna studies which disprove the khazar theory  a  study titled jewish and middle eastern nonjewish populations share a common pool of ychromosome biallelic haplotypes  mf hammer etal proceedings of the us national academy of sciences  doi pnas  found that despite their longterm residence in different countries and isolation from one another most jewish populations were not significantly different from one another at the genetic level admixture estimates suggested low levels of european ychromosome gene flow into ashkenazi and roman jewish communities    jewish and middle eastern nonjewish populations were not statistically different the results support the hypothesis that the paternal gene pools of jewish communities from europe north africa and the middle east descended from a common middle eastern ancestral population and suggest that most jewish communities have remained relatively isolated from neighboring nonjewish communities during and after the diaspora  a november  study titled the y chromosome pool of jews as part of the genetic landscape of the middle east  almut nebel et al american journal of human genetics nov     found that in most jewish populations male line ancestors appear to have been mainly middle eastern the study found that ashkenazi jews in particular share more common paternal lineages with other jewish and middle eastern groups than with nonjewish populations in areas where jews lived in eastern europe germany and the french rhine valley this is consistent with jewish traditions in placing most jewish paternal origins in the region of the middle east  a september  study titled european population substructure clustering of northern and southern populations  michael f seldin etal plos genetics doi journalpgen  found that both ashkenazi jews as well as sephardic jews showed more than  membership in the southern european group which made their results consistent with a later mediterranean origin of these ethnic groups  an april  study titled counting the founders the matrilineal genetic ancestry of the jewish diaspora  doron m behar etal plos one   e doi journalpone  found that about  of ashkenazi jews originate maternally from just four female founders who were of middle eastern origin  a january  study titled a genomewide genetic signature of jewish ancestry perfectly separates individuals with and without full jewish ancestry in a large random sample of european americans  anna c need etal genome biology   r doi gbr  found that individuals with full jewish ancestry formed a clearly distinct cluster from those individuals with no jewish ancestry this study showed that in dna terms jews both sephardic and ashkenazim cluster as a distinct groupsomething that if the khazar theory was true would be impossible  a december  study titled genomic microsatellites identify shared jewish ancestry intermediate between middle eastern and european populations  naama m kopelman etal bmc genetics    doi   found that  jewish populations show a high level of genetic similarity to each other clustering together in several types of analysis of population structure these results support the view that the jewish populations largely share a common middle eastern ancestry and that over their history they have undergone varying degrees of admixture with nonjewish populations of european descent  a december  study titled the genomewide structure of the jewish people  doron m behar et al nature    july  doinature  analyzed individuals from  jewish diaspora communities and compare these patterns of genomewide diversity with those from  old world nonjewish populations in order to provide comprehensive comparisons between jewish and nonjewish populations in the diaspora as well as with nonjewish populations from the middle east and north africa the results identified a previously unrecognized genetic substructure within the middle east and that most jewish samples form a remarkably tight subcluster and that traces the origins of most jewish diaspora communities to the levant  a june  study titled abrahams children in the genome era major jewish diaspora populations comprise distinct genetic clusters with shared middle eastern ancestry  atzmon et al american journal of human genetics   refuted the idea of largescale genetic contributions of central and eastern european and slavic populations to the formation of ashkenazi jewry this study found used genomewide analysis of seven jewish groups iranian iraqi syrian italian turkish greek and ashkenazi and demonstrated distinctive jewish population clusters each with shared middle eastern ancestry proximity to contemporary middle eastern populations and variable degrees of european and north african admixture this paper specifically excluded the khazar theory as an origin for presentday jews saying the genetic proximity    is incompatible with theories that ashkenazi jews are for the most part the direct lineal descendants of converted khazars or slavs  a march  study by steven m bray et al titled signatures of founder effects admixture and selection in the ashkenazi jewish population  proceedings of the us national academy of sciences  doi pnas  found that the ashkenazi jewish aj population    has a common middle eastern origin with other jewish diaspora populations while concluding that the ashkenazi jewish population has had the most european admixture  a march  study by christopher l campbell et al titled north african jewish and nonjewish populations form distinctive orthogonal clusters  proceedings of the us national academy of sciences doi pnas  found that genomewide analysis of five north african jewish groups moroccan algerian tunisian djerban and libyan demonstrated distinctive north african jewish population clusters with proximity to other jewish populations furthermore the study showed the sephardic jewish genome is compatible with the history of north african jewsfounding during classical antiquity with proselytism of local populations followed by genetic isolation with the rise of christianity and then islam and admixture following the emigration of sephardic jews during the inquisition finally this study added  these populations showed a high degree of endogamy and were part of a larger ashkenazi and sephardic jewish group endogamy the practice of marrying within a specific ethnic group rejecting others on such a basis as being unsuitable for marriage or for other close personal relationships  in his book legacy a genetic history of the jewish people oxford university press usa may  harry ostrer a professor of pathology and genetics at albert einstein college of medicine of yeshiva university and director of genetic and genomic testing at montefiore medical center medicine concluded that jews exhibit a distinctive genetic signature  jews are a race genes revealauthor uncovers dna links between members of tribe the jewish daily forward may    ostrer who is also director of genetic and genomic testing at montefiore medical center said in his conclusion that jews are a homogeneous group with all the scientific trappings of what we used to call a race ostrer also deals specifically with the khazar theory he pointed out that the findings from the jewish hapmap project see below completely refute the theories that ashkenazi jews are the descendants of converted khazars or slavs  jews a religious group people or race jerusalem post    the jewish hapmap project  a joint project of albert einstein college of medicine and new york university school of medicine was created to understand the structure of the genomes in jewish populations and is an outgrowth of the human hapmap project according to this project jewish populations are remarkable for maintaining continuous genetic cultural and religious traditions over  years despite residence all over the world its findings based on first hand dna studies amongst jewish populations around the globe found no evidence to support a central asian dna origin for jewry according to the jerusalem post the jewish hapmap project in new york city has so far shown in exquisite detail what had been conjectured for a century jewish populations from the major jewish diaspora groups  ashkenazi sephardic and mizrahi  form a distinctive population cluster that is closely related to semitic and european populations within this larger jewish cluster each of the jewish populations formed its own subcluster a high degree of mixing of ashkenazi sephardi italian and syrian jews caused them to become more closely related to each other than they were to middle eastern iraqi and iranian jews this genetic split seemed to have occurred about  years ago  jews a religious group people or race jerusalem post   dna studies find that ashkenazim jews have  european admixture both the behar study section  above and the atzmon study section  above were commented upon by the british former deputy editor of the journal nature  and currently the scientific correspondent for the n ew york times  nicholas wade in an article in that newspaper as follows jewish communities in europe and the middle east share many genes inherited from the ancestral jewish population that lived in the middle east some  years ago even though each community also carries genes from other sources  usually the country in which it lives adding that a major surprise from both surveys is the genetic closeness of the two jewish communities of europe the ashkenazim and the sephardim wade pointed out that the two studies refute the suggestion made by the historian shlomo sand in his book the invention of the jewish people that jews have no common origin but are a miscellany of people in europe and central asia who converted to judaism at various times jewish communities from europe the middle east and the caucasus all have substantial genetic ancestry that traces back to the levant ethiopian jews and two judaic communities in india are genetically much closer to their host populations wade wrote the shared genetic elements suggest that members of any jewish community are related to one another as closely as are fourth or fifth cousins in a large population which is about  times higher than the relationship between two people chosen at random off the streets of new york city ashkenazic and sephardic jews have roughly  percent european ancestry with most of the rest from the middle east the two surveys find the two communities seem very similar to each other genetically which is unexpected because they have been separated for so long  studies show jews genetic similarity nicholas wade new york times june    eran elhaiks single study attempts to refute the mass of earlier dna evidence the mass of dna and genetic evidence is therefore overwhelmingly indicative that despite a certain amount of european admixture among ashkenazim jewry there is still a clearly definable middle eastern genetic component to both ashkenazim and sephardic jewry despite all of these studiesand many more too numerous to list individually herein december  a single individual by the name of eran elhaik from the johns hopkins university school of medicine attempted to refute all of the above mentioned evidence his paper titled the missing link of jewish european ancestry contrasting the rhineland and the khazarian hypotheses was published in the journal genome biological evolution    doi gbeevs  in a nutshell elhaikwhose rather obviously jewish physical appearance should by itself indicate that there is indeed a common jewish type how else can many jews be physically recognized as jewsargues that his method of doing comparative studies between presentday central asian populations ashkenazim jews and nonjewish test groups proves that ashkenazim jews are a hotchpotch of genetic origins with a strong link to what he identifies as the khazar tribe even though elhaiks work is the only single paper as opposed to literally dozens of opposing dna studies written by a single jewish individual as opposed to the other papers which were written by dozens and dozens of scientists from around the globe jewish and nonjewish alike it has quickly become the mostquoted proof of the khazar theory critical errors in elhaiks paper elhaiks paper has a number of errors some small and a number of major ones but they are all serious because even the small errors cast doubt on his academic ability and motivation for example his paper discusses in detail what he sees as the geographic origin of the khazarsyet he completely misidentifies the geographic location of one of his test sample groups the mbuti and biaka pygmies these two groups elhaik asserts at least twice are to be found in south africa actually the mbuti and biaka pygmies are nowhere near south africa and are only to be found literally half a continent away in the congo while this may seem a small error it does indicate sloppiness in research which certainly does not bode well for the rest of the paper this sloppiness is again repeated when elhaik asserts that eastern and central european jews account for approximately  of over  million worldwide jews in reality the figure is far less of the estimated  million jews worldwide  million are ashkenazim and  million are sephardic a division of  european jews to  noneuropean jews and it should be pointed out that the zionist state of israel actually has a sephardic and mizrahi nonashkenazi jewish majority among jews these actual facts on jewish ethnicity are readily available and elhaiks motivation for making this clearly false claim could only be ascribed to a desire to underscore his general assertion namely that most jews are not middle eastern in origin and that jews are not race or a genetically similar people the most important error in elhaiks paper however is actually openly admitted namely that there is actually no khazar dna in existence against which any sort of measurement can be taken elhaik himself admits this in his paper the khazars have been vanquished and their remains have yet to be sequenced   in other words there is no record of what exactly khazar dna might have been as there is no record of what khazar dna isit is ipso facto physically impossible to determine who is descended from it and who is not elhaik attempts to circumvent this major problem by selecting what he calls surrogate populationsin this case contemporary middle eastern and caucasus populations anyone with a basic understanding of historical events in the caucasus in particular will immediately see that elhaiks assertion that current populations in that region can be taken to reflect those of  years ago is highly problematic and quite simply unsustainable the caucasus a region at the border of europe and asia situated between the black and the caspian seas has been crisscrossed by numerous peoples and races over the last  years ranging from indoeuropeans semites mongols and othersand is today highly genetically diverse a claim that dna samples from this region can be taken as any sort of dna yardstick is dubious to say the very least finally elhaiks methodology in comparing the dna samples is to make an understatement unique to him as marcus feldman director of stanford universitys morrison institute for population and resource studies said he elhaik appears to be applying the statistics in a way that gives him different results from what everybody else has obtained from essentially similar data  jews a race genetic theory comes under fierce attack by dna expert the jewish daily forward may    interestingly the study which was cited in the new york times of the jews as a race is exactly the same conclusion that was reached by german national socialist anthropologists and other experts who studied race science in the united states and elsewhere also many of the presentday extensive studies have been carried out by both gentile and jewish geneticists alike obviating any claims of racial bias elhaiks theory is completely refuted by the new most massive and most complete study ever done of the jewish genome one of elhaiks arguments was that the previous studies referenced above were done in the pregenomewide era using uniparental markers and including different reference populationsimplying that their results are not in line with the most modern dna sequencing methodology in fact at least one studywhich appeared after elhaiks work was first publishedhas confirmed the accuracy of the original studies and also completely refuted elhaiks hypothesis titled no evidence from genomewide data of a khazar origin for the ashkenazi jews this study was published by the journal human biology in august  behar doron m etal human biology access preprints paper   this paper emphasized the serious error with elhaiks work because the khazar population has left no obvious modern descendants that could enable a clear test for a contribution to ashkenazi jewish ancestry the khazar hypothesis has been difficult to examine using genetics furthermore because only limited genetic data have been available from the caucasus region and because these data have been concentrated in populations that are genetically close to populations from the middle east the attribution of any signal of ashkenazicaucasus genetic similarity to khazar ancestry rather than shared ancestral middle eastern ancestry has been problematic this latest most massive study of the jewish genome was a worldwide effort of geneticists both gentile and jewish to analyze jewish genetics researchers from laboratories around the globe including estonia russia italy greece bosnia and herzegovina croatia armenia the us and israel gathered together the largest jewish dna data set ever yet assembled the paper explained as follows here through integration of genotypes on newly collected samples with data from several of our past studies we have assembled the largest data set available to date for assessment of ashkenazi jewish genetic origins employing a variety of standard techniques for the analysis of population genetic structure we find that ashkenazi jews share the greatest genetic ancestry with other jewish populations and among nonjewish populations with groups from europe and the middle east no particular similarity of ashkenazi jews with populations from the caucasus is evident particularly with the populations that most closely represent the khazar region thus analysis of ashkenazi jews together with a large sample from the region of the khazar khaganate corroborates the earlier results that ashkenazi jews derive their ancestry primarily from populations of the middle east and europe that they possess considerable shared ancestry with other jewish populations and that there is no indication of a significant genetic contribution either from within or from north of the caucasus region the latest most uptodate and modern dna analysis has therefore completely refuted the khazar theory it is important to understand that this refutation has come from nonjewish and jewish scientists from dozens of different universities and geneticists all over the world and cannot be ascribed to a conspiracy part ii the historicallogical evidence the historical record shows jewish physical consistency one of the most obvious indicators of genetic commonality is physical appearance european people broadly resemble each other african people broadly resemble each other chinese people broadly resemble each other australian aborigines broadly resemble each other and so on it is a characteristic of genetically similar people to physically resemble each other jews are no different in this regard to any other people they too show a resemblance to each otherthis is why it is possible to often recognize a jewish person by his physical appearance a good example in point is the already mentioned jewish geneticist eran elhaik who despite physically embodying a jewish sterrotype recognized around the world tries to claim that there is no genetic commonality amongst jews the khazar theory holds that most ashkenazim jews are not semitic but are central asian converts to judaism proponents of the khazar theory fail to understand the logical consequence of their beliefnamely that a supposed central asian origin of most ashkenazim jews means that they will not physically resemble other jews as anyone can see this is not the case sephardic jews are on average slightly darker than ashkenazim jews but there is no doubt that there is a physical similarity which allows them still to be recognized as such above these two illustrations make the point even more dramatically on the left the ashkenazim jewess barbara streisand new york  on the right a jewish leader of israelite trade delegation as portrayed on a mural on the wall of the th dynasty  bc tomb of sobekhotep thutmose iv egypt two thousand years before the alleged khazar conversion and they look the same as modern ashkenazi jews streisands paternal grandparents came from galicia polandukraine and her maternal grandparents came from russiaif anyone would be khazar according to that theory it would be her nonetheless she closely resembles the only designated jew as portrayed on an egyptian tomb from  years ago the leader of a jewish trade delegation to egypt the genetic continuity is clearand if the khazar theory was true there would be no physical similarity because there would have been a racial sea change in jewish appearance left the famous banker of pompeii jucundus who lived circa  ad  years before the alleged ashkenazi conversion identified as a jew by the german anthropologist hans fk günther in his book  racial elements of european history fig a and b chapter viii  alongside the ashkenazi jew abe foxman of the adl the similarity between jucundus and foxman is clear and serves a further indication of the physical continuity of the jewish type over centuriessomething that would be impossible if the khazar theory was true in addition to genetic studies there have been extensive physiological comparison of jewish remains from burial sites from ancient israel and presentday ashkenazi and sephardic physiology all of which conclusively shows their similarity across both the sephardic and ashkenazi spectrumand their difference from european populations jewish supremacist behavior through the millennia disprove the khazar theory another piece of the jigsaw which disproves the khazar theory is that jewish supremacist behavior has remained constant throughout the millenniafrom biblical times right through to the present day most christians are aware of the behavior of the old testament jewswho burn rampage kill rape and enslave their way through palestine supposedly on order of their tribal god they are aware of the fact that the gospels of the new testament show that elite of the jews the pharisees were the biggest enemies of christ and arranged for his crucifixion and the new testament is clear that they led the persecution of christians which has continued through both jewish bolshevism and the cultural assault in the zio global media it must also be clear that the talmud the books of jewish law promoting jewish extremist supremacism and hatred against all nonjews was written hundreds of years before any alleged khazar conversion while it another debate altogether as to the historical accuracy of those events there is no question about jewish interaction with gentilesand romans in particularduring the first century ad the worlds first antijewish riots broke out in the city of alexandria in  ad and reoccurred in  ad  ad  ad and  ad in that year the archbishop of alexandria cyril ordered the expulsion of all jews from the city the roman historian socrates of constantinople not be confused with the socrates of classical greece in his ecclesiastical history recorded the reasons for this first great expulsion of jews from a nonjewish city in detail and reveals behavior by jewish supremacists exactly as the world experiences it today over  years later   the jews were continually factious and there was added to their ordinary hatred of the christians    cyril on being informed of this sent for the principal jews and threatened them with the utmost severities unless they desisted from their molestation of the christians these menaces instead of suppressing their violence only rendered the jewish populace more furious and led them to form conspiracies for the destruction of the christians one of which was of so desperate a character as to cause their entire expulsion from alexandria socrates hist eccl vii  pc lxxxii  ff the very first jewish community outside of the middle east was established in rome in  bcand it was not long before their activities roused roman public opinion against them the famous orator cicero among others frequently spoke against the presence of jews during sittings of the roman senate in his famous pro flacco oration which dealt with the case of a roman aristocrat lucius valerius flaccus accused of unlawfully confiscating jewish money cicero said now let us take a look at the jews and their mania for gold you chose this site chief prosecutor laelius and the crowd which frequents it with an eye to this particular accusation knowing very well that jews with their large numbers and tendency to act as a clique are valuable supporters to have at any kind of public meeting many other prominent and famous romans such as seneca juneval and tacitus all went on record as complaining about the activities of jews within the roman empire the roman historian tacitus in his most famous work histories described the activities of the jews as follows in order to secure the allegiance of his people in the future moses prescribed for them a novel religion quite different from those of the rest of mankind among the jews all things are profane that we hold sacred on the other hand they regard as permissible what seems to us immoral    the other practices of the jews are sinister and revolting and have entrenched themselves by their very wickedness wretches of the most abandoned kind who had no use for the religion of their fathers took to contributing dues and freewill offerings to swell the jewish exchequer and other reasons for their increasing wealth may be found in their stubborn loyalty and ready benevolence towards brother jews but the rest of the world they confront with the hatred reserved for enemies they will not feed or intermarry with gentiles though a most lascivious people the jews avoid sexual intercourse with women of alien race among themselves nothing is barred they have introduced the practice of circumcision to show that they are different from others tacitus histories  the famous british historian edward gibbon in his monumental work the decline and fall of the roman empire lippincourt philadelphia  vol  page  discussed jewish supremacist behavior in roman times this way from the reign of nero to that of antoninus pius the jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion of rome which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres and insurrections humanity is shocked at the recital of horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of egypt of cyria and of cyrene where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting natives and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a race of fanatics whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the roman government but of all human kind antijewish literature during roman times was very widespread one work by the greek apion was so wellknown that the romanized jewish historian josephus who wrote the famous account of the jewish uprising of  ad called the jewish wars wrote an entire book trying to refute apions arguments the roman emperor tiberius formally expelled the jews from rome in  ad they returned shortly thereafter only to be expelled once again in  ad in  ad emperor trajan ordered that all jews in mesopotamia should be killed saying that they were the cause of continual uprisings in that region one of the most famous emperors of the eastern roman empire justinian  ad adopted a comprehensive antijewish policy which barred jews from the civil service military posts and any other positions of influence in his government all of these events predate the supposed khazar conversion by centuriesyet it can be seen that the identical behavioral patterns are on display before and

dr duke and pastor dankof on trumps america first foreign policy 
today dr duke had pastor mark dankof as his guest for the hour they talked about donald trumps appointments to his new cabinet they gave low marks to representative mike pompeo as the new cia director for his past policy positions although they noted his loyalty to trump as a potential silver lining they also panned nikki hailey as the un ambassador which however does allow trump supporter henry mcmaster succeed her as south carolina governor 
the most hopeful prospect is congresswoman tulsi gabbard from hawaii who is a potential secretary of state she has supported trumps desire to reconcile with russia and has been the most vocal opponent in congress of the obama administrations efforts to overthrow syrian president assad her appointment would go a long way towards wresting control of american foreign policy from jewish neocons and putting americas interests first again

tulsi gabbard for secretary of state an example of the need for political realignment 
by dr patrick slattery  on monday donald trump met with hawaii congresswoman tulsi gabbard she has been mentioned as a possible secretary of state or even secretary of defense she is an iraq war combat veteran and major in the hawaii national guard its not just that she would be preferable in these jobs to john bolton rudi giuliani or mitt romney but is probably the very best candidate from the ranks of the washington establishment 
in particular she is unique in being a strong and principled opponent of any intervention in syria she wants the united states to stop supporting isis and other rebel groups and let the russians iranians and hezbollah help president assad defeat the jihadists and end the syrian civil war which is more an armed invasion than a real civil war this is exactly the right approach 
and its not just that she is on the right side of this issue it is her signature issue she is on the armed services and foreign affairs committees so this is what she has spent her time on 
its not that shes perfect it has been noted that she at the very least pays lipservice to israel everyone on capital hill does lets face it zionism is the established religion in america and there is a religious test for office but her fault goes further than that she condemned the government of thenukrainian president victor yanukovich in february  just as hillary clintons erstwhile secretary of state victoria nuland was organizing his overthrow gabbard like everyone else in congress then supported arming the jewishdominated government that nuland put in place in kiev 
even so her congressional website does not carry any mention of ukraine since  and her vocal opposition to starting world war iii with russia over syria seems to indicate that her view towards russia have become more realistic this as has been noted elsewhere is in line with trumps view 
but there is one more significant benefit of appointing gabbard as secretary of state it could help trigger a badly needed realignment of american politics as people like ralph nader have long been telling us there is no significant difference between democrats and republicans that is because the most divisive issues in politics are not the existential issues that face our society and the world 
if there has been one litmus test in politics during my lifetime it has been abortion it may engender strong emotions but it hardly ranks with nuclear war as a threat to humanity yet i cannot tell you how many staunchly antiwar people in  voted for prowar democrat john kerry because they were worried about bush appointing prolife judges to the supreme court talk about getting your priorities backwards 
this year despite senior statesmen like mikhail gorbachev warning us that the threat of a nuclear world war iii has never been higher foreign policy was all but absent from the campaign only nonmainstream elements like the paleoconservatives the altright greens and stray individuals from the old left like stephen f cohen managed to finally get it injected into the campaign just in the nick of time in such a close election one could certainly make the case that this made the difference 
at this point in time war has to be the top priority as important as immigration may be what difference will it make in a postapocalyptic mad max world of course if we could organize around opposing jewish power it would take care of war but far too few people are awake enough to make this possible in fact israel currently has no role as an organizing feature in americas political alignment as both parties so unanimously support it blindly but as the realignment proceeds along an america first noninterventionist foreign policy an america first immigration policy is a natural outcome 
if trump embraces gabbard and rejects the neocons and their goy toys like mitt romney it would really help clarify the sides in this struggle party labels mean nothing romney and ryan and the like already revealed themselves by opposing trump there are tons of people outside of the republican party who could conceivably rally around trumps foreign and other policies and it is imperative that the donald make a point of bringing in some of these people into high profile positions while visibly snubbing his true enemies from within the republican party",2016-11-22

another great video from project veritas that shows you just how blurred the lines between politics and organized crime have become 
the latest of the project veritas videos shows once again that its all one integrated system despite any protests to the contrary the same democratic machine that spouts off about dark money lives on it breathes it and thrives on it and will take it no matter how dark and dubious it is whether its routed from foreign interests through foreign institutions and through roundabout ways 
the system runs of money on power and favors traded and influence bought and sold for all the leftist politics on the surface beneath the waters is the murkier tide in which folks like the clintons swim its the dark water in which money gets you access to hillary or obama in which the royal courts of the royal left are filled with power brokers who do the things that make the money move around",2016-10-29
178,eng subs  bombardment of residential lugansk village osce records craters,"they knew the end of the clinton lies begins theres only one lie left october   daniel greenfield 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
during hillary clintons first presidential campaign neera tanden was described as the wonk behind hillary a close associate of the clintons tanden helped shape policy for both bill and hillary then she switched to playing that role for obama 
while hillarys email scandal broke tanden was in charge of the center for american progress a radical leftwing group that had been described as obamas idea factory and she was chatting with john podesta the top clintonite who had founded cap podesta had cochaired the obamabiden transition project neera tanden would cochair the hillarykaine transition project under podesta who headed up hillarys presidential campaign podesta had helped shape the last eight years of national politics through obama and tanden looked forward to shaping the next eight under hillary 
and what did they think of hillary did they believe their defenses of her wrongdoing 
podesta and tanden ridiculed her associates for the coverup why didnt they get this stuff out like  months ago so crazy she wondered unbelievable podesta wrote they wanted to get away with it 
since the early days of the email scandal weve been treated to the sordid rituals of feigned innocence the issue was a nonissue clinton surrogates were quick to assure us and even if it was no one did anything wrong the flies on the wall knew better though and now we can all be the flies on the wall 
away from the cameras and the briefings the clintonites held their bosses in contempt neera tanden a supposed close associate of hillary blasted her instincts as suboptimal and described her as suffering from a character problem and there was never any doubt as to what was going on 
tanden ridiculed cheryl mills for the mess mills fired off an email to podesta warning that obamas denial wouldnt hold up we need to clean this up  he has emails from her  they do not say stategov she warned 
obama had offered his usual denial claiming to have only learned about the scandal from the media the revelation that hillary had emailed obama from her illegal address would show that he had lied but meanwhile his people struggled to reinvent his lie by claiming that while he knew about her illegal address he didnt know that it was illegal this put his lie in line with hillarys lie 
there was only one problem 
when in doubt the clintons take refuge in the final lie that you may be able to prove that they did wrong but not that they meant to do wrong that was hillarys final email defense to the fbi spliced with claims of memory loss due to a concussion was that old sergeant schultz favorite i know nothing 
but that defense completely falls apart once you prove that they did know that is what the leaked emails have begun doing they are establishing that the sergeant schultz defense is utterly hollow 
cheryl mills knew john podesta knew barack obama knew and hillary clinton knew 
when obama told a lie that could easily be disproven while trying to distance himself from hillary mills quickly fired off a warning that he had better get his story straight and his people did that makes obama complicit before and after the fact he knew what hillary was doing when she was doing it and his people participated in the effort to cover it up afterward not just to protect her but to protect him 
hillary clinton was not a rogue actor she was part of an administration that had waged a war on transparency even media allies had dubbed it as the least transparent administration in history 
lies censorship and targeting whistleblowers were the norm for obama inc a new york times reporter dubbed it the greatest enemy of press freedom in a generation the washington post noted that the obama administration routinely makes a mockery of its longago pledge to establish itself as the most transparent administration in us history the ap pointed out that it more often than ever censored government files or outright denied access to them 
bizarre administration email dodges included epa boss lisa jackson using richard windsor as her alias jacksonwindsor left the epa and took a seat on the board of the clinton foundation 
tanden and podesta didnt take issue with hillary clinton breaking the law but with her clumsy political instincts her inability to fake sincere apologies and spin scandals as smoothly as obama hillarys biggest flaw in their eyes was her clumsiness at covering up acts that were routine in in obamaworld they didnt despise her because she broke the law but because she was bad at it 
that made her a threat to their political futures 
hillarys clumsy instincts led her to the point of having to admit what she did while denying having intended to do it motive is simultaneously the strongest and weakest defense you can prove what someone else did but it is hard to prove what someone else meant to do 
unless you have their emails 
this is hillarys firewall its what every painful trickle of the scandal was meant to drag out and delay every partial revelation is buying time while bringing us closer to the final breach in the motive wall 
what the podesta emails tell us is that they knew those around hillary knew and those around them knew that the inner circle knew they knew and they hated hillary for being a bad liar and now as the inside drama of clintonworld spills across the internet the red queen moves closer to being in check 
by making it all about motive hillary clinton turned personal communications particularly emails into the key instrument of culpability that is why podestas emails are such a hot commodity its why her emails are becoming an even bigger prize 
neera tanden was right hillary clintons political instincts are suboptimal she is the member of the obama graduating class voted least likely to be able to lie convincingly on national television and she has a perverse knack for dragging everyone around her into her scandals while exposing their own 
we know that her people knew that she lied we know that obama lied all thats left is her final lie",2016-10-30
179,jewish pirates of the caribbean,"search election law violation was hillarys idea orders to use donald duck to foment violence at trump rallies came straight from the top october   matthew vadum 
democrat hillary clinton personally authorized illegal dirty tricks operations against republican donald trumps campaign according to top democrats appearing in undercover video 
in the third hillaryrelated video released by acorn slayer james okeefe and his project veritas action fund this past sunday oct  clinton is directly implicated in a scheme to use donald duck to mock trump and troll his supporters at trump campaign rallies 
among disney cartoon characters donald duck was a natural choice after all his name used to appear regularly on voter registration documents when bill and hillary clintons favorite community organizing group the nowdefunct acorn hired hobos and felons to go on voterregistration drives 
earlier this year democrats in donald duck costumes started appearing at trump events across america costumed individuals would walk around carrying signs one said trump ducks releasing his tax return 
this cutesy publicity stunt isnt necessarily the problem though the problem is that hillary clinton ordered it and apparently broke the law by coordinating with a taxexempt nonprofit group 
prominent in the video is political organizer robert creamer who is very high up in the democratic partys hierarchy he has reportedly visited the obama white house  times including  meetings with obama personally 
one of the visits took place in obamas personal living quarters 
its a very big deal that creamer visited the presidents residence in the white house a former senior white house employee told frontpage in an interview white house employees can work there for years and never visit the residence 
creamer a practitioner of the agitation arts taught by marxist community organizing guru saul alinsky is husband tof rep jan schakowsky dill a socialist and advocate of singlepayer health care creamer is considered by many to be the legislative architect of obamacare he also wrote a series of bad checks to cover his salary at a nonprofit and went to prison prosecutors wanted to send him up the river for  months but he got off with merely five months and  months of home confinement from a friendly democrat judge 
creamer is a founder of the unsavory political consulting firm democracy partners  the list of partners on the companys website is a whos who of elite democratic party power players 
in addition to creamer the partners are 
midwest academy founder heather booth  website developer marc cerabona  organizer wyatt closs  seiu veteran mac dalessandro  maccabee group founder brett c di resta  crosscurrents foundation cofounder ken grossinger  former media matters for america online organizer david grossman  former seiu national field director for politics john hennelly  strategic communications advisor marilyn katz  organizer jackie kendall  strategist lupe lopez  political consultant mike lux  strategic advisor josie mooney  consultant patrick pannett  organizer christine pelosi her mother is house minority leader nancy pelosi usaction president khalid pitts  former dnc general counsel joe sandler  consultant linda saucedo  fundraiser renee schaeffer  former new organizing institute senior fellow joel silberman  and organizer cheri whiteman  
listed as associates are lauren windsor  executive director of american family voices and aaron black  who appears in the undercover videos black describes himself in the footage as basically deputy rapid response director for the dnc on the ground at trump events adding nobodys supposed to know about me 
frontpage published an article yesterday examining democracy partners 
for a master practitioner of fascistic tactics creamer is amazingly lacking in selfawareness or just plain dishonest he wrote a fatuous ahistorical oped in the huffington post earlier this year titled can fascism triumph in america 
like other fascist movements trump says out loud  and legitimates  the kind of hateful violent language that was previously whispered only in the privacy of peoples living rooms 
bear in mind that quite apart from his mischaracterization of trumps public statements creamer is shown in the videos masterminding an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents 
fomenting and carrying out acts of violence against political opponents was what the fascist third reich did using the sturmabteiling or sa also called brown shirts and storm troopers ditto for mussolinis squadristi black shirts maos red guards irans basij  and haitis tonton macoute  
creamer explains the donald duck action in the third video 
in the end it was the candidate hillary clinton the future president of the united states who wanted ducks on the ground creamer says in one of several exchanges so by god we would get ducks on the ground 
creamer makes it clear he knows that this coordination between his consulting firm democracy partners and the campaign was a huge legal landmine when he said dont repeat that to anybody 
the whole duck thing that came about the reason we moved it from dnc to americans united for change was to just do a hopscotch but the actual idea was hatched way back in may creamer associate scott foval said making a pun 
the duck has to be an americans united for change entity creamer said this had to do only with some problem between now acting dnc chief donna brazile and abc which is owned by disney because they were worried about a trademark issue thats why its really silly 
we originally launched this duck because hillary clinton wants the duck in any case so she really wanted this duck figure out there doing stuff so that was fine so we put all these ducks out there and got a lot of coverage and trump taxes and then abcdisney went crazy because they thought our original slogan was donald ducks his taxes releasing his tax returns 
creamer is shown in the video hoping disney would file a lawsuit against democrats for using donald duck in the campaign likely because such a thing would generate publicity 
let them sue us please god he says looking to the heavens and clasping his hands together as if in prayer i doubt they will because were paying to rent or buy the suits thats where they get their license fees were not using it for commercial purposes 
the wall street journal reported aug  that donald ducks was the creation of the democratic national committee then on sept  the paper reported the dnc is no longer associated with the duck  americans united for change is now managing the duck  
but out of public view the dnc and the clinton campaign were still controlling the duck operation breaking federal campaign coordination laws okeefe says in narrating the third video 
we kind of divvy up responsibilities so sometimes it will be like campaign owned said jenna price assistant press secretary at the dnc so sometimes you will see that they advised something or they are taking credit for things so like we arent taking credit for the duck anymore thats like random ally groups but its still something that were involved in 
brad woodhouse president of americans united for change expected the presence of the duck at events would spark violence i think this duck is going to get roughed up somewhere 
in one segment foval says i almost got punched on monday morning i mean i was in a duck costume 
the nations campaign coordination laws were enacted after president richard nixons watergate scandal okeefe notes 
for an activity to violate the law it must meet a threepart test he explains 
first there must be payment by someone other than the candidate for electionrelated activity second a campaign has to be materially involved in shaping communications for a third party group and third electoral advocacy has to take place close to an election 
okeefe continues 
the payment prong of the test is complicated but just the fact that foval a paid employee of americans united for change was the duck at some events constitutes payment by aufc conduct based on their own admission the campaign creamer their agent and aufc coordinated the duck activities and finally content donald ducks is undeniably political content directed against one candidate for the sole purpose of helping another 
the fourth video released yesterday isnt so much an expose of wrongdoing but it does provide ample evidence of creamers ties to the clinton campaign and to president obama himself 
in a phone call creamer says i spend most of my time overseeing the trump events around the country i mean thats what i do for the clinton campaign uh so thats interesting as well 
in another scene when an undercover reporter phones saying he needs an immigration lawyer with powerful connections for a wealthy client in syria creamer makes it clear he is happy to help by reaching out to obamas inner circle 
i just need to i will try and find a couple of good referrals to you and get back to you pretty quick then okay  on the first well ill just talk the guy im going to talk to first to see if this is up his alley the first thing is up his alley its the guy who ran the campaign for president obama he has a firm thats pretty well connected 
in another setting creamer says 
heres what i do for the clinton campaign by the way im a consultant to the clinton campaign wherever trump or pence go in the country we make sure that there are press events in the tv market or whatever  whether theyre big turnouts or little turnouts whatever that drive our message wherever the candidate goes to drive his message so that on any given day they will be between them probably in six places so our team makes sure there are events in all those six places every day so it is a lot of events and we try and help define the other candidate 
every morning i am on a call at  that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters added creamer 
he continued 
im in this campaign mainly to deal with what you know earned media with the television radio with earned media and social media not with paid media not with advertising there would be a whole different advertising  everybody is driven on the same tracks though so then there are a couple a bunch of people in the brooklyn office of the clinton campaign that are responsible for possible aspects of communication like we do rapid response and there is a guy there i work with heavily is the guy that i was just communicating with on that kind of stuff for instance we just found i just sent him a note beforehand when we came here that said my understanding is there might be another revelation of another woman talking about trump this afternoon 
creamer bragged again about his ties to president obama 
oh barack obamas was the best campaign in the history of american politics i mean the second one i mean the first was good too i was a consultant to both the second one was everything hit on every level and every aspect 
obama is a pro creamer said ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago 
i was just at an event with him in chicago actually on friday last he is just as good as ever i do a lot of work with the white house on their issues helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in i mean for immigration reform for the the health care bill trying to make america more like britain when it comes to gun violence issues 
the second video  released oct  was a primer on how democrats get away with massive voter fraud 
its a very easy thing for republicans to say well theyre bussing people in said scott foval then national field director for americans united for change 
well you know what weve been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin assholes for  years and were not going to stop now  were just going to find a different way to do it so i mean i grew up with that idea they used to bus people out to iowa if we needed people out there wed bus people out to iowa 
in a discussion okeefe described as focusing on bringing people from one state to another state to vote illegally foval who also worked as deputy political director at george sorosfunded people for the american way pfaw explains how to get away with voter fraud 
instead of bussing people in it is better to have them travel in their own personal vehicles he said 
would they charge each individual of voter fraud or are they going to go after the facilitator for conspiracy which they could prove its one thing if all these people drive up in their personal cars if theres a bus involved that changes the dynamic 
its the legality because you can prove conspiracy if theres a bus he said if there are cars its much harder to prove  if theres enough money you have people drive their povs personally owned vehicles or you can have them drive rentals 
foval says its easy to keep the voter fraud operation a secret so you use shells use shell companies 
democrats are untouchable he said the question is whether when you get caught by a reporter does that matter because does it turn into an investigation or not in this case this state the answer is no because they dont have any power to do anything 
foval explained in the first video how proclinton super pacs communicate with each other and how their information finds its way to the dnc presumably a violation of federal law 
i guarandamntee you that the people who run the super pacs all talk to each other and we and a few other people are the hubs of that communication 
were consultants foval says so were not the official entity and so those conversations can be had between consultants who are working for different parts 
he adds 
the thing that we have to watch is making sure there is a double blind between the actual campaign and the actual dnc and what were doing theres a double blind there so they can plausibly deny that they knew anything about it 
the clinton campaign is fully in it veteran leftwing strategist robert creamer confirms on hidden camera hillary knows through the chain of command whats going on 
okeefes group project veritas action fund filed a formal complaint against the clinton campaign with the federal election commission last week 
the complaint states that project veritas 
uncovered a criminal conspiracy where in the words of scott foval the way it works is the hillary for america campaign pays dnc dnc pays democracy partners democracy partners pays the foval group the foval group goes and executes  on the ground this has been done in a manner to evade federal election law and violating coordinated expenditures rules 
the complaint also accuses priorities usa action alliance for retired americans americans united for change and the democratic national committee of accepting prohibited and excessive contributions in the form of coordinated expenditures contrary to federal law and regulations 
the first undercover video okeefe released sent shock waves through the political community 
in that video  released oct  we learned that the frequent outbursts of violence at republican candidate trumps campaign rallies have been orchestrated and paid for by clintons campaign 
the idea was to foment violent at trump rallies in order to create the false impression that his campaign and supporters were violent crazy people and at the same time provide evidence to support the lefts predetermined narrative that the billionaire businessman is a dangerous fascist 
such behavior constitutes terrorism austin bay writes at the observer  
creamer ran what amounts to a domestic us political terror and propaganda operation dedicated to undermining the  us presidential electionrigging the election to use the current term  
the election rigging scheme he commanded relies on street thuggery that means physical fearterroris a core component of americans united for changes crooked enterprise street thuggery is very lowlevel terrorism but it is a type of terrorism nonetheless and it is wrong to call it otherwise hardboy muscle bottles and two by fours are street thuggerys kinetics bottles and baseball bats are not al qaedas high explosivesbut they incite fear and when they crack heads they cause casualties people bleed street thuggery as an arm of politics is violent criminalized politics on an ugly downward slope to much worse the worse including lynchings and pogroms if you dont think street thuggery is terror then consider kristalnacht 
and okeefe isnt finished with the hillary clinton campaign yet

180,project veritas ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago,"realism about the jihad threat in oklahoma oklahoma state rep john bennett ventures where few dare to tread october   robert spencer 
in an age of nearuniversal denial and willful ignorance at the highest levels about the ideological roots nature and magnitude of the jihad threat it is as unusual as it is refreshing to find lawmakers at any level who are willing to approach the problem honestly state representative john bennett of oklahoma a marine and combat veteran of iraq and afghanistan  is one of an alltoorare breed 
on tuesday bennett held an interim study on the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america in his request to hold this study he explained this will be a study of the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america 
this kind of study should have been held not just in the oklahoma house of representatives but in the us house and senate as well that such an idea is inconceivable is an indication of the fix were in and the situation is only marginally better in oklahoma nowadays the misinformation and disinformation about what were up against is so universal that anywhere the truth is told about this threat there is significant pushback from the allies and enablers of jihad and islamic supremacism 
and so it was in tulsa on tuesday the interim study featured testimony by former fbi agent john guandolo and chris gaubatz whose exploits as an undercover agent infiltrating the hamaslinked council on americanislamic relations cair are chronicled in the eyeopening book muslim mafia  
gaubatz and guandolo presented evidence including land records showing that the islamic society of greater oklahoma city isgoc is owned by the muslim brotherhood group the north american islamic trust nait that both cair which has an active chapter in oklahoma city and isgoc are muslim brotherhood organizations and that cair has extensive ties to the jihad terror group hamas which styles itself the muslim brotherhood for palestine they pointed out that since imad enchassi the imam of isgoc is a palestinian and has all these ties to the muslim brotherhood he likely also has links to hamas 
guandolo and gaubatz did not base their case on innuendo and hearsay they laid out fbi evidence muslim brotherhood documents and more demonstrating that the claims they were making were based on solid evidence 
predictably however the mainstream media which we now know beyond any shadow of a doubt is simply and solely a propaganda arm for the left and the democratic party  focused entirely on the presence of adam soltani of cairok and enchassi the tulsa world ran a piece with the hysterical headline state representative brands cairok its director and a local imam as terrorists it quoted soltani raging against bennett rep bennett is shamefully wasting taxpayer money to promote his own biased agenda this hearing was a new low for rep bennett as his guests presented a biased narrative that achieves nothing more than demonizing and marginalizing the oklahoma muslim community 
the world magisterially told its readers that cair is a muslim civil liberties and advocacy group working to enhance the understanding of islam it didnt see fit to mention that cair is an unindicted coconspirator in a hamas terror funding case  so named by the justice department there was not a word in the world report about how cair officials have repeatedly refused to denounce hamas and hizballah as terrorist groups several former cair officials have been convicted of various crimes related to jihad terror  cairs cofounder and longtime board chairman omar ahmad as well as its chief spokesman ibrahim hooper have made islamic supremacist statements  ahmad denies this but the original reporter stands by her story  a california chapter distributed a poster telling muslims not to talk to the fbi and a florida chapter distributed pamphlets with the same message  cair has opposed virtually every antiterror measure that has been proposed or implemented and has been declared a terror organization by the united arab emirates 
but the tulsa world and other mainstream media outlets that covered bennetts study did not see fit to inform their readers of any of that instead predictably enough they portrayed the hearing as a baseless exercise in racebaiting and fearmongering conducted by a politician up for reelection 
john bennett and the people of oklahoma deserve better there are legitimate questions about cair and isgoc bennett dared to raise them tuesday for that he is being subjected to a media lynching that is cynically designed to obscure the genuine concerns he raised  yet ever since a member of isgoc beheaded a coworker in  these concerns are more urgent than ever 
the media enablers of jihad must be decisively repudiated please email the speaker of the oklahoma house jeff w hickman politely and courteously expressing your support for john bennett and requesting that his hearing be just the first of a series his email is email protected and his phone number is   
john bennett has yet again stuck his neck out for freedom in these hard times those who are willing to do that have to hang together",2016-10-27
181,they knew the end of the clinton lies begins,our new country women and minorities hit hardest the rape culture the media wont cover october   ann coulter every ethnic group except whites blocvotes for the democrats coincidentally the democrats have brought in another  to  million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades it doesnt help that white voters cant agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate in  workingclass whites sat out the election rather than vote for the outoftouch rich guy they saw in mitt romney this year the outoftouch rich guys say theyll vote for hillary because trump is tacky and gross the sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats  the top  percent the rest of us will be their servants the people who will be worse off are everybody else  the working class the middle class who will soon be working class and most of all women minorities children the elderly the weakest and most vulnerable members of society look to mexico for your future  or any third world country or to univisions jorge ramos the ruling class in mexico is composed of europeanlooking white descendants of spanish conquistadors who raped the native population giving them only their spanish names in return british settlers in america brought women with them explaining latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape criminal justice researcher shana maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household and women are subordinate to men  hispanics and latinos are more likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim the victim not the perpetrator is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family one american detective said that today police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing when it comes to multiculturalism you cant say we love the empanadas  but we dont want yearold men raping their nieces this isnt an a la carte menu we get all the attributes of the cultures were importing as described in excruciating detail in adios america the lefts plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole  our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants thus for example where i would have chosen the headline illegal alien convicted of incest child rape the chattanooga tenn times free press went with the less catchy man guilty in case of human smuggling and where i would have used the headline illegal alien repeatedly raped yearold girl at job site the commercial dispatch in columbus mississippi went with the more subtle columbus resident charged with molestation immigrant women arrive in america thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape incest and spousal murder are acceptable only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled in  brooklyn judge edward pincus sentenced a chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood the female head of the asianamerican legal defense and education fund margaret fung applauded the ruling somewhat amazingly newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime anything to keep the third world immigration flowing in  a yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens who cheered and videoed the attack when the news first broke shaneequa jupiter who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger that could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants even if shaneequa had scoured the headlines she would have been on the lookout for austin men or two compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack  two held in attack on child  austin americanstatesman texas july    two mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  daily mail online uk july   needless to say the new york times did not cover the mexican illegal alien gang rape at all by contrast the times and every major american news outlet extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age at about the same time in about the same place the second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was  but she was an enthusiastic participant sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex those rapes just a few years earlier got a fullcourt press the defendants were africanamerican the victim was mexican that time there were articles in the huffington post gq slate salon and mother jones it even made the new york times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team similarly within a few months of one another in  two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur alabama for assaults on yearold girls one suspect was africanamerican the other was a hispanic immigrant only one made the newspaper guess which one when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of hillarys foreign policy successes journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and colleagues definitely not islam sampling of new york times commentary on logans rape  why we need women in war zones i would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened  this attack also had nothing to do with islam  reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not  in my experience muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment perhaps american men could do better but as american women may soon discover they never had it so good manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america they are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the democrats and cheap labor to the rich the chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife for example came to america based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher our country will be zimbabwe but  if all goes according to the democrats plan  theyll get to be mugabe thats hillarys dream if she wins joe sobrans parody of the typical new york times headline about anything will come true women and minorities

there are some very dubious awards out there that you just dont want to win being one of the top recipients of islamic money in politics certainly tops that list hillary clinton likes to complain about dark money this is as dark as money gets as the middle east forums research shows  
hillary clinton tops the list raking in  from prominent islamists this includes  from senior officials of the council on americanislamic relations cair declared a terrorist organization by the united arab emirates on november

other top recent recipients of money from the enemy include rep keith ellison  and rep andre carson  
the top ten list includes nine democrats one independent sen bernie sanders accepted  and no republicans

we saw the statistical outcomes with the refugee numbers where the vast majority of syrian refugees were muslims with hardly any christians at all now we have a snapshot of how that same bias worked with jobs 
according to an email chain from  john podesta received lists of exclusively muslims and asians to be considered for jobs in the obama administration the email chain revealed that in this process middle eastern christians were purposefully excluded or set aside in a separate list with an aide writing 
in the candidates for top jobs i excluded those with some arab american background but who are not muslim eg george mitchell many lebanese americans for example are christian in the last list of outside boardscommissions most who are listed appear to be muslim american except that a handful where noted may be arab american but of uncertain religion esp christian

186,weird bans on women in iran,"bill clinton inc billions for the foundation  million for the clintons october   
call it the unintended revenge of doug band 
band used to be bills huma the guy that the big guy couldnt go to the bathroom without let alone perform the simplest tasks the clinton foundation was a band project the waters grew murkier but the recent email leaks revealed a rather devastating doug band memo on how he was making money for the whole infrastructure of what he called running bill clinton inc 
and band was also organizing personal income directly for clinton under the heading forprofit activity of president clinton ie bill clinton inc band wrote we have dedicated our selves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activitiesincluding speeches books and advisory service engagements in support of the presidents forprofit activity we also have solicited and obtained as appropriate inkind services for the president and his familyfor personal travel hospitality vacation and the like neither justin nor i are separately compensated for these activities eg we do not receive a fee for or percentage of the more than  million in forprofit activity we have personally helped to secure for president clinton to date or the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements 
band mentions four such arrangements without naming them bill clinton was paid nearly  million to be honorary chancellor of a forprofit college laureate international universities according to reports and the familys tax returns a dubaibased firm gems education paid bill clinton more than  in  according to the tax returns band also lists a variety of speaking fees previously disclosed by the clintons including hundreds of thousands of dollars each from ubs ericsson bhp and barclays in  alone according to the clintons tax returns bill clinton earned  in speaking fees 
of course there was lots of synergy between the for profit stuff and the non profit stuff between dougs teneo interests and the entire clintonworld octopus 
we have dedicated ourselves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activities band wrote he also said he had sought to leverage my activities including my partner role at teneo to support and to raise funds for the foundation 
bands memo provided data showing how much money each of teneos  clients at the time had given to the clinton foundation how much they had paid bill clinton and in some cases how he or kelly had personally forged the relationships that resulted in the payments 
band wrote that teneo partners had raised in excess of  million for the foundation and  million in paid speaking fees for bill clinton he said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out  million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place 
band also described how kelly helped expand a fruitful relationship with ubs global wealth management introducing bill clinton to a top executive at a  charity dinner in the ensuing years ubs upped its giving to the foundation signed on as a teneo client and agreed to pay bill clinton for speeches band wrote 
band was actually making the case that the entire network of the clinton foundation is completely entangled with the private financial interests of the clintons not to mention the interests of people around them 
banks and major corporations were doing business with bills toady paying bill money and donating to the clinton foundation through arrangements made by the party of the first part 
band described in the memo how he combined his work for cgi and teneo he wrote that he had used a hotel room upstairs from the  cgi gathering to meet with teneo clients he also acknowledged giving free cgi memberships to target teneo clients being cultivated as potential foundation donors memberships generally cost  a year 
teneo meanwhile named bill clinton its honorary chairman clinton had been initially tapped for a threeyear arrangement in which he would provide advice to teneo regarding geopolitical economic and social trends according to a separate june  memo that band wrote to the state department seeking ethics approval for the former presidents employment 
bill clinton was initially paid  million by teneo according to man of the world a book written with the former presidents participation by author joe conason 
and heres where it gets appropriately entertaining 
but band outlined that kelly his teneo cofounder had served simultaneously between  and  as an unpaid economic envoy to northern ireland appointed by thensecretary of state hillary clinton and as head of a separate consulting company whose clients included coke ubs and dow band wrote that the arrangement was consistent with kellys state department ethics agreement 
kellys multiple roles came together during one state department event in  when thensecretary clinton recognized dow among other companies for creating jobs in northern ireland and thanked kelly for his work on the issue 
dow became one of teneos first major clients according to bands memo dow chief executive andrew liveris had been introduced to bill clinton over a round of golf with kelly in august

187,hillary clinton tops islamist money in politics list,"wife of fbi official investigating hillary got k from hillary allied pac october   daniel greenfield 
the system is broken its deeply corrupted by insider politics  the situation at the center of power has reached the point of utter unaccountability insider politics function as a shadow government that needs to change restoring america requires dismantling much of the federal government not only for constitutional reasons but because its a simple matter of saving the republic 
hillary clinton headlined a major fundraiser for a political action committee shortly before the group steered nearly  to the wife of the fbi official who oversaw the clinton email investigation dailymailcom has learned 
clintons ties to the common good va  a virginia state pac run by clintons longtime friend and advisor terry mcauliffe its governor  came under scrutiny this week after the wall street journal reported that the group donated heavily to the state senate campaign of jill mccabe 
her husband andrew mccabe led the fbi investigation into clintons emails 
andrew mccabe now the deputy director of the fbi told the wall street journal that he complied with federal ethics rules and was not promoted to lead the clinton probe until months after his wifes unsuccessful state senate bid ended 
common good va was the largest single donor to jill mccabes campaign election records show giving her  between june and october of  
she was the thirdlargest recipient of money from the group which can only contribute to virginia state candidates 
her campaign also received an additional  from the democratic party of virginia a group over which mcauliffe exerts significant control combined the money made up nearly onethird of her total funding 
now mccabe a pediatrician suddenly decided to run for public office unopposed that was certainly nice of the dems to not only put a first timer unopposed but to throw piles and piles of cash at her and some of that cash was coming from a key former clinton foundation man at the center of the latest foundation scandal 
although common good va is only allowed to fund statelevel candidates many of its largest donations came from outside of virginia  including  from clinton foundation official doug band in new york  from clinton loyalist robert johnson in maryland and  from clinton megadonor stephen cloobeck in nevada 
in the following months common good va received several major donations from other close clinton associates including  from bill clintons business partner ron burkle in california and  from ready for hillarys finance committee member leonard lauder in new york 
there are basic conflicts here someone this linked to the clinton network should never have been investigating hillary regardless of the dates and timing but this is exactly what happened with benghazi",2016-10-27
188,obama used religious test to favor muslims over christians,"reprinted from spectatororg  
tom hayden the vietnam war protester and sds founder died this past weekend at age  
haydens journey was in many ways tragic born december  in the detroit suburbs he was not unlike many radical leaders a reddiaper baby his parents were irish catholics who named him after st thomas aquinas and sent him to catholic school his father was a marine who worked for chrysler and an abusive drunk haydens parents had a rocky marriage and divorced when he was a boy which affected him terribly haydens friend and exradical david horowitz observed that hayden harbored what irving howe once described as an obscure personal rage possibly from his estrangement from his father tom was indeed an angry man wrote horowitz who seemed in perpetual search of enemies 
hayden channeled that anger into a group that did much damage to america and was the antithesis of anything that thomas aquinas would have ever imagined sds students for a democratic society 
hayden will be forever young and forever a hippie in the memories of many americans the snarling activist who married hanoi jane fonda and literally wrote the script for sds hayden wrote sdss manifesto its founding port huron statement which haydens creampuff obituary in the washington post generously referred to as an expansive utopian manifesto that extolled participatory democracy as an antidote to the complacency and conformity of the eisenhower decade 
right 
haydens odd expressions of participatory democracy included another writing he scribbled an infamous june   letter wishing good fortune and victory to the north vietnamese colonels who were killing american boys in southeast asia  using the same kind of artillery that haydens sweetheart jane posed beside in her stint as a viet cong covergirl that was just one of countless disturbing actions by tom hayden at the time all of which todays leftists merrily sweep under the rug as they uphold him as a crusader for civil rights and of course social justice 
but not etched in our memory was what might have been tom haydens swan song long after his and his wifes cheerleading for the viet cong namely the document that he wrote for our president of fundamental transformation few know this but hayden was a founder of another group of destructive forces a group called progressives for obama 
the groups members came together in  coalescing around the only democratic presidential nominee in their lifetimes who was farleft enough for them to support they constituted a whos who of the s sds crowd among the nearly  formal signers to progressives for obama were mark rudd carl davidson jane fonda thorne dreyer daniel ellsberg richard flacks john mcauliff jay schaffner and more columbia university was naturally wellrepresented if not through the likes of rudd who shut down the campus in  then through current faculty such as todd gitlin a former sds president who today is professor of journalism sociology and chair of columbias doctoral program in communications 
whereas the likes of obama friends bill ayers and bernardine dohrn were thrust into the national spotlight in  by conservatives like glenn beck and sean hannity progressives for obama flew under the radar largely unnoticed even by the right 
appropriately spearheading progressives for obama was the man who had spearheaded sds tom hayden was one of the four initiators of progressives for obama along with barbara ehrenreich bill fletcher jr and danny glover 
it is no exaggeration to say that the signers list of progressives for obama resembled the roster of sdsers called to testify before congress in december  for their subversive activities aside from the likes of hayden rudd and davidson other sdsers among progressives for obama were bob pardun who was sds education secretary from  and paul buhle a professor who has recently sought to revive sds 
among these names from the insane s all were fired up in  over the unique opportunity that a fellow farleft radical one barack obama offered they saw obama as a golden chance a onceinalifetime moment and they got it on november   obama won the day and they at last won the day too 
and therein among the progressives for obama the testimony of leader tom hayden was especially revealing 
understand that after his early life establishing sds meeting with and expressing good fortune and victory to the viet cong and vigorously protesting the american system hayden went into politics professional activism and education like his erstwhile sds brethren hayden grasped the power of higher education which they have pervaded and served as a professor at pitzer college and also at obamas alma mater occidental college 
like mark rudd like bill ayers like bernardine dohrn all of them now in higher education hayden had come to view a quick revolution of the system as too daunting if not impossible he had become much more patient instead advocating a progressive evolution of slower measured change  by  he was seeking to advance the progressive cause within the established mainstream democratic party 
of course hayden once helped blow up the democratic partys national convention in  no matter the party of  was different and warmly accepted him 
hayden was ecstatic over barack obamas presidential campaign he jumped in with both feet looking to assist wherever he could with a rush of enthusiasm not seen since his days undermining america in vietnam not one to tinker around hayden got to work on a formal organization and unifying statement as he had done for sds  once again there at the creation the man who drafted sdss pivotal port huron statement got to work drafting mission statements for progressives for obama 
during the  campaign a touched hayden was moved to verse over the emergence of obama in one article titled obama and the open and unexpected future written for commondreamsorg selfdescribed as a website for breaking news  views for the progressive community hayden mused 
i didnt see him coming when i read of the young state senator with a background in community organizing who wanted to be president i was at least sentient enough to be interested when i read dreams of my father sic i was taken aback by its depth this young man apparently gave his first public speech against south african apartheid at an occidental college rally organized by students for economic democracy the student branch of the campaign for economic democracy which i chaired in  the buds of curiosity quickened 
hayden saw in obama a longawaited vehicle for economic democracy an instrument to channel an equal distribution of wealth  economic justice or redistributive change as obama himself had once put it hayden wished that win or lose the obama movement will shape progressive politics for a generation to come he also hoped that that progressive movement likewise might transform obama as well both could reinforce and shape one another 
hayden wrote that in june  when obama was elected later the following november hayden was beside himself with joy surely shocked that the american electorate had finally voted for a president that tom hayden saw as his kind of president once upon a time traditional democrats like haydens parents had shaken their heads in disgust at what tom and his pals did to their partys convention in chicago in  at what they did during the days of rage the next year at what they did at columbia during the student strike and on and on but now by  the democratic party was theirs it belonged to the s kiddies 
the former sds founder became particularly vocal in his praise for obama once the election was over during the election the goal was to organize raise money but not speak too loudly out of fear of driving away the moderates and remaining traditional democrat moms and pops who had worked in the mines and the mills who joined unions who clinged to their god and guns who prayed rosaries and filled churches who were prolife and antigay marriage with the presidency now secured hayden could open up joined by his former comrades at the takenoprisoners website of progressives for obama he began regularly sounding off against obamas critics  those opposing single payer or the public option in healthcare reform or government management of general motors  with the subtlety of a howitzer 
with the presidency won hayden and his allies were free to express themselves to demonize healthinsurance companies the financialservices industry aig the big three automakers or whatever other capitalist reptile lenins phrase stood in the way of president obamas desire for reform and mandate for change 
in the twoterm presidency of fundamental transformation under obama hayden and friends achieved many of their common dreams 
by this election cycle in  tom hayden must have been mesmerized by the revolution he and his fellow radicals had pulled off in the democratic party 
alas it was fitting that tom hayden became seriously ill his final stand during a turn for the worse at the democratic national convention in philadelphia this past summer where he was striving to ensure that the democratic party continue along the radical path of fundamental transformation that he and his allies had been unable to achieve via sds and the weather underground that path in the hands of hillary clinton is assured 
today at long last for tom hayden and friends the new democratic party and the new america is theirs he can rest in peace assured that his mission is finally being accomplished",2016-10-27

obamas abstention from a un vote against the us is a new low for the most antiamerican administration in american history under obama our foreign policy has been reoriented toward damaging our own interests as much as possible but actively opposing us policy at the un is a new low 
the resolution ares is on the necessity of ending the economic commercial and financial embargo imposed by the united states of america against cuba 
it was introduced at the request of cuba back in  with a memorandum that accused america of pursuing an aggressive policy against cuba with the declared aim of imposing on it the political social and economic order which the united states authorities consider most fitting this policy has included direct military intervention the threat of nuclear annihilation the instigation and carrying out of countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate cuban leaders 
as obamas creepy toady ben rhodes tweeted no reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose 
except the failed policy is that of the united states by we rhodes means that obama and the left arent going to defend the united states in international forums when they disagree with the us 
all this is yet another reminder that the people running the country are not of the country theyre a hostile foreign ideology that sees itself as separate from the united states and does not believe it has any responsibilities toward the united states 
at the un samantha power took the antiamerican positions to applause from a un united with obama against america 
for more than  years the united states had a policy aimed at isolating the government of cuba for roughly half of those years un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain applause thank you

butbut i thought we were trying to help people 
obamacare visionary jonathan stupidity of the american voter gruber is back when last we heard from the man with the same name as the die hard villain he was being ushered off the scene after explaining how stupid everyone was  
an architect of the federal healthcare law said last year that a lack of transparency and the stupidity of the american voter helped congress approve obamacare in a clip unearthed sunday massachusetts institute of technology professor jonathan gruber appears on a panel and discusses how the reform earned enough votes to pass 
he suggested that many lawmakers and voters didnt know what was in the law or how its financing worked and that this helped it win approval lack of transparency is a huge political advantage gruber said and basically call it the stupidity of the american voter or whatever but basically that was really really critical for the thing to pass gruber made the comment while discussing how the law was written in a tortured way to avoid a bad score from the congressional budget office he suggested that voters would have rejected obamacare if the penalties for going without health insurance were interpreted as taxes either by budget analysts or the public if cbo scored the individual mandate as taxes the bill dies gruber said 
now the gruber is back and ready to explain why the only problem with obamacare is the lack of severe beatings  
there is no sense in which the law has to be fixed the law is working as designed however it could work better and i think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that we need a larger mandate penalty we have individuals who are essentially freeriding on the system theyre essentially waiting until they get sick and then getting health insurance the whole idea of this plan which was pioneered in massachusetts was that the individual mandate penalty would bring those people into the system and have them participate the penalty right now is probably too low and thats something i think ideally we would fix 
ideally we would penalize gruber and everyone involved in inflicting this monstrosity on the public but predictably grubers proposal is to offer up more beatings until morale improves while pretending that anyone who isnt on obamacare is just a free rider",2016-10-27
191,tom hayden from sds and viet cong to progressives for obama,"search the left in power  clinton to obama david horowitz explains how the democrats became a leftwing party in volume vii of the black book of the american left october   richard baehr 
below is richard baehrs review of david horowitzs new book the left in power clinton to obama reprinted from american thinker with permission the book is volume  of the black book of the american left  a multivolume collection of david horowitzs conservative writings that will when completed be the most ambitious effort ever undertaken to define the left and its agenda order here  we encourage our readers to visit blackbookoftheamericanleftcom which features horowitzs introductions to volumes  of this volume series along with their tables of contents reviews and interviews with the author 
every year there is some report of the blissful ignorance of american history demonstrated by the supposedly best and brightest at elite american universities suffice it to say the collected writings of david horowitz on the american left which constitute part of a solid foundation for understanding the last half century of american politics are nowhere to be found on any college or high school reading list 
horowitzs latest book the left in power clinton to obama  is the seventh volume in his ninevolume collection the black book of the american left  this new volume provides a collection of his writings over the last quarter century focusing primarily on the lefts control in our government and culture as horowitz reveals even during the bush years conservatives were on the defense and leftists controlled the narrative as they attempted to destroy bush and his chances for reelection in  their primary mode of attack was to undermine americas efforts in iraq almost from the start of the conflict when just months earlier a majority of senate democrats and near half of house democrats had supported the president the left then destroyed bushs second term with bogus charges of racist neglect in the handling of hurricane katrina there was plenty of incompetence in the response to katrina but local and state officials  all democrats of course and many of them african american  were the principal operators on the ground during the crisis 
the immediate abandonment of support for the iraq war effort was a signal event in american history sending a message that a large part of the democratic party was not remotely concerned about the morale of our men and women fighting overseas the weak effort by some democrats to hold onto an ounce of patriotic resolve  end the war support the troops  was designed more for campaign speeches than any meaningful attempt to convey national unity for the effort underway by our armed forces so too the obsession with abu ghraib gave the lie to the democrats support our troops message as a broad brush was used to paint the incident as somehow what you would expect from our military on a routine basis 
horowitz outlines this narrative faulting the bush administration for failing to fight harder to present its story of why we went into iraq and the risks if we had done nothing regrettably the bush administration never had a chance to get a better defense of the iraq war out to the media most in the media considered the bush administration illegitimate due to its narrow victory in the  presidential contest a lie to be sure  unfortunately it is almost certainly true that the media today are far more in the bag for the left than ten or twenty years ago and work harder at pushing the lefts agenda the soft liberalism of walter cronkite has been replaced by cable and national network anchors who routinely bury stories embarrassing to their side and focus on those that can do damage to the other side during the current presidential election cycle we have seen the most prestigious media organs explain why it is necessary and appropriate for them to be biased this year it is a special time they argue because trump is in their view a unique threat to the republic 
on the other hand the media have been loath to consider the damage to the country caused by barack obama  the loss of respect abroad for americas will to fight the degradation of our military readiness the fraying of ties with allies and the near obsessive outreach to americas enemies that led to agreements such as the nuclear deal with iran best described as an abject surrender of american interests that will lead to the funding of fanatical nuclear regime about  of those supposedly sensible proisrael democrats walked the plank behind their great leader on that deal with no visible regrets to date there was simply too much political risk to oppose the first black president of their party the media were happy to parrot the administrations talking points for the nuclear deal something the manipulators crowed over at the white house 
at least in the propaganda use of abu ghraib the left was honest in revealing what it thinks about the military as horowitz outlines in article after article the left is fighting a war that most americans do not see disguising its intentions through its aggressive unceasing promotion of progressive policies to make america a better place this commitment to deception emerges horowitz reveals from the allegiance to the ideology of saul alinskys rules for radicals a formative doctrine for both barack obama and hillary clinton the progressive goal is to achieve a new society that has never been seen before in this country though it has been promised and has catastrophically failed in many places around the globe in america the left is not only unconcerned with selling their program to the public but also horowitz argues it is fearful of the result of voters knowing what it is pursuing one prime example was the admission of mit professor and obamacare architect jonathan gruber that health care law would never have made it through congress if it had been presented honestly 
the left is also busy at work making it easier for itself to win politically horowitz provides chapter and verse on the lefts efforts to rapidly change the composition of the voting pool  motor voter registration with no birth certificate required fighting every effort to combat voter fraud with charges of racism and turning the clock back even when states were willing to pay for potential voters obtaining the needed documents to register support for open borders expansion of legal immigration and amnesty and citizenship and voting rights for more than ten million already in the country illegally here the lefts mentor and financier is george soros and his buddies who have funded dozens of organizations which fight on multiple fronts every day to advance the left politically and horowitz has done a great public service by his discover the network listing of the people responsible for americas steady drift to the radical left 
the left uses the racism charge in many of the confrontations it creates of course the problems of americas inner cities all under complete control of one political party for half a century have never been of even near equal interest to the democrats as their ability to continue to win enormous majorities among inner city voters particularly african americans the left has fully endorsed the teacher unions opposition to charter schools and voucher programs though both are popular with minority group parents and children the two major teachers unions are simply too powerful a support group for the democratic party campaign cash votes and volunteers for the left to support policies that might lead to a better future for kids as opposed to continued growth in expenditures for the teachers unions and their workforce 
in the last two years the sorosfunded black lives matter movement has created a near national hysteria over the alleged systematic effort by police to kill unarmed black men between two and three dozen unarmed blacks are killed by cops each year many of them in situations where the victims were almost certainly responsible for what happened to them  michael brown in ferguson is a prime example one wonders where the news media are to report on the police shooting of unarmed whites which greatly outnumber those of unarmed blacks perhaps because there are no riots or looting these incidents have no cachet more likely they do not fit the systemic racism charge now routinely thrown around by everyone from the current president to hillary clinton 
in chicago in  months this year over  blacks mostly men have been shot and killed almost exclusively by other black men by year end over  chicagoans will have been shot one might think this was a bigger story of urban calamity and civil society breakdown than a shooting in charlotte chicagos mayor says that police have gone fetal avoiding making stops in crime ridden neighborhoods with the aclu looking over their shoulder demanding a report for every stop and activists in the neighborhoods treating the police with scorn and abuse following a bad police shooting captured on video and kept hidden from the public by chicagos mayor to protect his reelection bid rahm emanuel must also have read alinsky for he knows whose hide to protect first and foremost the victims of the police pullback in chicago baltimore st louis and other cities called the ferguson effect are many more dead black men killed in crime waves that are reminiscent of the s even the fbi director admits the ferguson effect is real when not covering for hillary clinton 
horowitz latest book is full of insights and straight talk on the goals and the mission of the left and how it has advanced its cause this last quarter century he provides the kind of arguments that keep his books from getting reviewed by the new york times and there is always a horrible slur available from the left to describe a viewpoint that counters one of its missions the left chooses to ignore the argument and uses character assassination for the people making it it argues that these are people horowitz included unworthy of serious consideration or respect 
silencing the critic or the dissident or limiting his visibility has been a long time weapon of the left so far horowitz keeps writing and america is free enough that the left though it clearly wants to cannot ban his books george soros and his family have another  billion to spend on changing america the alinsky acolytes have their mission laid out to make use of the funds and create an america where the smart bureaucrats can organize society and distribute its wealth so results are all equal and we can all sing along with the pete seeger songs as we turn away from any role overseas where of course we have primarily been an agent of evil and disinvest in defense every year 
lets hope that some of americas young will read horowitz booksand learn what their professors and teachers wont teach them",2016-10-27
192,obama votes against us at un,"an eyebrowraising new study from a nonpartisan research institute october   matthew vadum 
the obama administration is using billions of dollars in banking fines to fund radical leftwing activist groups that work to elect democrats according to an eyeopening new study from a nonpartisan research institute 
during eric holders term as attorney general from february  through april  a little under  billion was paid by us banks under the threat of federal lawsuits all but  million of that sum came from three big settlements bank of america citigroup and jp morgan chase 
many of the cases rest on bogus disparate impact theory which leftwing government lawyers use to make sure that banks become liable for charges of racism based upon the perceived injustice of lending disparity in certain lower income areas regardless of the reasons for the disparity 
instead of being used to help the supposed victims of these banks the money flows to leftist allies of president obama 
adding insult to injury the process by which the money snakes its way to leftwing organizations is both corrupt and unconstitutional according to the report from the government accountability institute that is called follow the money how the department of justice funds progressive activists bestselling clinton cash author and anticorruption crusader peter schweizer is gais president the full page report is available in pdf form here  
the report states 
the department of justice has curated an opaque system wherein appointed attorneys can legally extract money from the private sector and redistribute the funds to thirdparty organizations outside of the appropriations processan unprecedented and extraordinary disregard for congressional authority 
it adds these funds directed by the doj effectively replaced funding to activist nonprofits previously denied by congress 
much of the cash moves through neighborworks the nonprofit gave more than  million to the rabblerousing group neighborhood assistance corp of america naca whose leader bruce marks calls himself a bank terrorist it also gave over  million to asian americans for equality aafe an organization with communist roots and continued close ties to a very vocal north korean sympathizer 
the illgotten funds extorted from the banks also trickle down to leftwing groups such as national council of la raza nhs of chicago national urban league and operation hope 
many of the nonprofits that receive such funding spend the money to elect democrats 
catalist a george sorosfunded forprofit data analytics company specializing in leftprogressive causes along with a group called nonprofit vote mobilize these federally funded nonprofits  to get the vote out for those who tend to be reliably progressive the report states 
catalist was founded by former bill clinton aide harold ickes in  following democrats electoral wipeout in  leftwing activists believed republicans owed george w bushs reelection victory to heavy spending on voter contact technology including databases 
according to a capital research center report  
catalist boasts it was vital to president obamas  victory by its own admission over  organizations campaigns and committees used the companys services based on data that was loaded into the catalist databases and then standardized a catalist analysis of the  cycle says progressive organizations the obama campaign and federal party committees attempted to contact more than  million people this means that the progressive community attempted to contact over  of the us adult population contacts were delivered inperson over the phone by mail and over the internet 
of course leeching off others is generally how the activist left funds itself apart from oceans of cash supplied by leftwing fatcat megadonors like george soros and michael bloomberg and a galaxy of radical foundations the left derives its sustenance by ripping off taxpayers at the federal state and local levels 
the report states the evidence shows the left is using the department of justice and the power of the federal government to extract money from financial institutions for redistribution to progressive activists whose real intent is far more partisan than the housing and housing education for which they ostensibly exist 
in other words the left plays by a different set of rules than the rest of america there is no level socalled playing field in american electoral politics in a sense the system is rigged there is the parasitic left feeding at the taxpayer trough versus everybody else 
conservatives knew about this travesty already but few studies have been put together that follow the money trail for a half century the left has been using taxpayer dollars to fund efforts to advance radical subversive causes in the united states 
changes in federal social policy in the mids helped lay the groundwork for this insidious leftist astroturfing under the profoundly antisocial war on poverty the federal government has been handing out taxpayer money since  to liberal and radical socalled community organizations to help them agitate against the status quo one could say america declared war on itself and conscripted saul alinskyinspired pressure groups to do the fighting in recent decades those on the left  including groups like acorn and moneygrubbing con artists like jesse jackson sr  have also become quite adept at working outside the public sector to shake down banks and other businesses to fill their war chests 
conservative groups receive no such largesse from uncle sam and in fairness many such organizations would likely reject government funding on principle if offered it 
this sueandsettle corruption will undoubtedly continue if hillary clinton becomes president secretary of labor tom perez  no stranger to the shakedown business himself is said to be a top contender for the attorney general post in any new clinton administration perez who previously ran the dojs civil rights division is also a past president of casa de maryland a notorious advocacy group for illegal aliens funded by george soros and the late venezuelan strongman hugo chavez 
the moneyraising scam described in the gai report isnt the only way leftwing groups fill up their bank accounts 
activist groups were encouraged to agitate by the carterera community reinvestment act which enshrined in law a kind of lending protection racket banking regulators who had come under the influence of groups like acorn had the power to make trouble for banks that failed to lend enough money to borrowers in socalled underserved communities banks that paid enough  whatever that means  got left alone but banks that didnt got their legs broken 
few serious economists doubt that the mortgage market debacle and the economic collapse of  were caused by the deliberate weakening of underwriting standards carried out in the name of ending discrimination 
leftists played both sides they called banks racist and demanded more subprime lending for minorities and then when the loans went bad called the banks racist for supposedly targeting minority borrowers it was and is pure gangsterism through the magic of dysphemism the once sought after subprime lending was transformed into predatory lending 
the shaking down of lenders intensified when thentreasury secretary robert rubin presided over the clinton administrations effort to put the cra on steroids banks began to make risky subprime loans and fannie mae and freddie mac aggregated them for sale in the secondary market as mortgagebacked securities these practices made it easier for banks to give in to the demands of acorn and other groups to originate more and more doomed mortgages because they knew they could offload their highrisk debt on quasigovernmental suckers fannie and freddie which were under intense political pressure to service the subprime market 
president clinton turned the community reinvestment act a onceobscure and lightly enforced banking regulation law into one of the most powerful mandates shaping american citiesand as senate banking committee chairman phil gramm memorably put it a vast extortion scheme against the nations banks howard husock of the manhattan institute wrote in city journal  
when husock wrote in  us banks had committed nearly  trillion for innercity and lowincome mortgages and real estate development projects most of it funneled through a nationwide network of leftwing community groups intent in some cases on teaching their lowincome clients that the financial system is their enemy and implicitly that government rather than their own striving is the key to their wellbeing 
enterprising leftwing levelers never tire of dreaming up these redistribution schemes

193,obamacare is great we just need to punish people for not using it,"search what will replace isis this is a war to determine whether the future will belong to the west or to islam october   daniel greenfield 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
before long the same administration that declared the fighting in iraq over several times will claim victory over isis the timetable for its push against the islamic state appears to have less do with the victimized christians and yazidis who have been prevented from coming here as refugees in favor of syrian muslims than with the clinton presidential campaign like obamas declarations that the wars in afghanistan and iraq were over the announcement that isis has been defeated will be premature 
it is based on a profound misunderstanding and misreading of islamic terrorism 
long before its current string of defeats isis had begun evolving into another al qaeda a multinational alliance of jihadists scattered around the world bombing mosul isnt hard but try bombing marseille brussels or london there is no doubt that the ability of isis to temporarily establish a caliphate allowed it to build a network that could carry out terror attacks from new york to miami to nice to munich but it would be dangerous to assume that losing iraq and syria will stop isis 
isis doesnt matter the idea of isis does and the idea of isis is islamic supremacism 
the organization we think of isis has transformed and rebranded countless times even now our leaders vacillate between calling it isis isil or more childishly daesh while it dubs itself the islamic state we have been fighting it in one form or another for over a decade it would be unrealistically optimistic to assume that the war will end just as this old enemy has shown its ability to strike deep in our own cities 
the bigger error though is to think that we are fighting an organization we are fighting an idea that is not to contend as obama does that we can debate it to death it is not the sort of idea that argues with words but with bullets bombs and swords but neither does it just go away if you seize a city 
al qaeda in iraq not only survived the death of zarqawi but it became even more dangerous under baghdadi it would be risky to assume that isis will die with him instead it may very well grow into a new phase of al qaeda one that ties together some of the worlds deadliest islamic terror groups into a network that is decentralized enough that it will not suffer from al qaedas leadership fatigue 
the rise of islamic terrorism has been an incremental process in which new groups learn from the mistakes of the old and supersede them if isis does recede into a localized oblivion reemerging only on occasion to suicide bomb something or someone in baghdad then a deadlier and even more effective group is likely to take its place each group will move one step closer to realizing the caliphate 
to break the cycle we must confront the idea of the caliphate at the heart of islamic terrorism 
isis is not unislamic it is ruthlessly and uncompromisingly islamic in that unlike its predecessors in the muslim brotherhood and al qaeda it makes the fewest compromises to civilizational sensibilities its goals are the same as those of every islamic political organization including those dubbed moderate it seeks to restore and enforce an islamic system in every part of the muslim world before moving on to conquer and subjugate the nonmuslim world if this were merely some fringe belief held by a tiny minority of extremists then it could be bombed to pieces in some syrian or iraqi backwater 
but its the driving force of islam thats why it wont go away no amount of appeasement will banish it 
taking in more muslim settlers pressuring israel and letting the muslim brotherhood colonize our foreign policy wont do it weve tried it and it actually makes islamic terrorism much worse 
when the announcement is made the usual suspects will pat themselves on the back for having defeated isis by mobilizing a muslim coalition but it wasnt obama who mobilized a muslim coalition the coalition such as it was mobilized them obama provided useful support to islamic state sponsors of terror such as iran and turkey assorted islamic jihadists on the ground some blatantly associated with sunni and shiite terror groups in their internal jihadist conflict with isis over who will fight us 
the allies we are aiding today will be the ones bombing us tomorrow 
and that is why claiming credit for beating isis accomplishes nothing isis is an expression of an islamic impulse encoded in the koran islamic groups differ in the tactical expression of that impulse isis was nastier and uglier than most of the islamic terror groups we had dealt with before this though even it found its boko haram affiliate in nigeria occasionally a little too much to stomach 
if isis vanishes from the world stage islamic terrorism will be easier to dismiss or so the thinking goes the islamic state was better at viral videos than the media that tried to whitewash islamic terror it was hard to ignore but a scattering of islamic terror groups around the world will be forgotten by the public 
history suggests thats wishful thinking 
islamic terrorism has shown no signs of receding growing muslim populations both at home and in muslim settlements in the west and the increase in travel and communications the infrastructure of globalism spread it from the most backward to the most advanced parts of the world wealthy and unstable muslim countries rich in oil but poor in power finance its spread through mosques and guns 
these are the ingredients that give us isis or any other combination or letters that stands for islamic terror to do anything meaningful about it we would have to reverse the decline of the west 
islam originally spread into a vacuum created by civilizational decline civilizational decline is why it is rising once again an obscure local terror group eventually turned into isis by filling a power vacuum even as obama performs another touchdown dance some other group will be making that same journey its mission will be the familiar one of replacing our civilization with its own 
until we come to terms with this civilizational struggle we will go on fighting endless wars in the sand and coping with endless terror attacks in our own cities because we have failed to recognize the nature of the enemy we are not fighting an acronym whether its isis or isil we are fighting an islamic state 
this is a war to determine whether the future will belong to the west or to islam",2016-10-28
194,the left in power clinton to obama,"the splcs libelous new report on antimuslim extremists equating counterjihadists with jihadists robert spencer 
the objective of this libelous new report from the hardleft moneymaking and incitement machine the southern poverty law center splc is made plain within it before you book a spokesperson from an antimuslim extremist group or quote them in a story research their background  detailed in this indepth guide to  of the most visible antimuslim activists and consider the consequences of giving them a platform 
they wish to silence those who speak honestly about the nature and magnitude of the jihad threat blaming us for a supposed rise in islamophobia if they really want to stamp out suspicion of islam of course they will move against not us but the likes of omar mateen syed rizwan farook tashfeen malik nidal malik hasan mohammed abdulazeez dzhokhar tsarnaev and the myriad other muslims who commit violence in the name of islam and justify it by reference to islamic teachings 
the splc doesnt do that because its objective is not really to stop islamophobia at all but to create the illusion of a powerful and moneyed network of islamophobes who can only be stopped if you write a check to the splc thats what this is really all about 
in constructing this illusory edifice the splc labels me and fourteen others antimuslim extremists we are of course no more antimuslim than foes of the nazis were antigerman but note the word extremists thats the mainstream media and obama administrations term of choice for jihad terrorists in what way are we extremists has anyone on the splcs hit list and given the splcs track record of inciting violence against its targets that is exactly what it is ever blown anything or anyone up beheaded anyone boasted of our imminent conquest of any territory and the massacre of or enslavement of its people no all we have done is speak critically about jihad terror and sharia oppression the splc is trying to further the libel that we are the other side of the coin the nonmuslim bin ladens and awlakis until we commit any terror attacks or conspire with others to do so however the splcs libel is only that a libel 
its also passingly ironic that the splc list includes several people who are doubtless horrified to be in this company as they have endeavored for years to distinguish their message from that of those whom they themselves would smear as islamophobes but their temporizing and pandering didnt work they ended up on the index of prohibited thinkers anyway as will ultimately anyone who dares to note that islam just might have something to do with the acts of murder committed in its name and in accord with its teachings 
the report as a whole stands as an example of the lefts strange tendency to present true statements as if they were selfevidently false without bothering to explain why apparently the splc knows its supporters and is aware that it doesnt need to bother with troublesome things like you know facts 
the splcs hit list recurrently excoriates people for making true statements that it apparently regards as selfevidently false for example it says that ann corcoran of refugee resettlement watch accuses immigrantrun stores of illegally trafficking in food stamps this is a case that corcoran makes with evidence  evidence that the splc doesnt bother to try disproving it says that steven emerson of the investigative project on terrorism has claimed that the obama administration extensively collaborates with the muslim brotherhood that he actually has done so doesnt seem to bother them as andrew c mccarthy has noted  barack obama has spent his presidency cultivating islamists particularly from the international muslim brotherhood and its affiliates in the united states the splc also hits emerison for having asserted that europe is riddled with nogo zones regarding nogo zones here are some news articles from just the past few weeks 
germany police sick of citizens nogo zone fears 
the splc excoriates brigitte gabriel of act for america for saying that any practicing muslim who believes the word of the koran to be the word of allah  who goes to mosque and prays every friday who prays five times a day  this practicing muslim who believes in the teachings of the koran cannot be a loyal citizen of the united states yet it says nothing of course about the many teachings of the quran that contradict american constitutional principles the denial of the freedom of speech the death penalty for apostasy the devaluation of women and more how to reconcile these teachings with us citizenship the splc did not bother to explain 
the splc quotes david horowitz saying there are only a couple of degrees of separation between anybody on the left and the terrorists  and that includes people in the democratic party even those who are antiterrorist here again no refutation is offered  yet the lefts dalliance with palestinian jihad groups and overall antiamericanism make it impossible to dismiss horowitzs assertion 
frank gaffney of the center for security policy were told is gripped by paranoid fantasies about muslims destroying the west from within the splc doesnt bother to mention the explanatory memorandum on the general strategic goal for the brotherhood in north america  the captured muslim brotherhood internal document that explained that brotherhood members must understand that their work in america is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions 
in attacking pamela geller of the american freedom defense initiative the splc descended to outright fabrications notes geller  their claim that i insist that obama is the love child of malcolm x is patently untrue the splc also states that i have spoken to a neofascist group in germany when in fact i have never even been to germany it characterizes former fbi agent john guandolos claim that cia director john brennan was a convert to islam as an outlandish accusation when in fact a us asset assigned overseas with brennan in saudi arabia when he was station chief confirmed years ago their firsthand account that brennan was indeed the target of a saudi intelligence influence operation that led to his conversion brennan has also stated publicly that he visited mecca which is impossible for a nonmuslim to do unless he is a special guest of the saudi king 
even more strangely the splc targets ayaan hirsi ali a woman who grew up as a muslim in somalia suffered genital mutilated at the hands of muslims is under death threats from muslims and lives in exile from her homeland because of muslims instead of trying to discredit her the splc should be honoring her for her stand for human rights against sharia oppression but the splc has other priorities 
of me the splc concedes that i am a real intellectual but complains that i am entirely selftaught in the study of islam an odd objection one cannot be both selftaught and a real intellectual in any case its false i am indeed mostly selftaught in the study of islam and make no secret of or apologies for it every days headlines proves me correct nonetheless the fact is that i did first read the quran and began studying islam in earnest while at the university of north carolina my claims says the splc are provably false but then only offers a number of them that are demonstrably true without any attempt to refute them 
it even says that i have referred to barack obama as the first muslim president this one epitomizes the dishonesty of the splc the quote comes from an article i wrote in  discussing how obama was not a muslim stating that his obvious affinity for islam and the muslim world could make him into our first muslim president the way bill clinton was called our first black president after eight years of obama id say i was proven correct in rather spectacular fashion 
the splc finally hits me for having even suggested that the media may be getting money to depict muslims in a positive light 
the facts are once again deeply unfortunate for the splc george soros funded a report on islamophobia on twitter and gave  to the center for american progress for a defamatory report on alleged islamophobes he also spent  for favorable coverage of the muslim migrant inundation bought favorable coverage of the iran deal  and bought islamophobia propaganda after the san bernardino jihad massacre 
but what need does the splc have of facts it knows its readers wont check up on the veracity of its claims but will accept them at face value since the splc is of the camp of the saints the enlightened and tolerant left those who are outside that camp clearly have no rights that the splc feels bound to respect",2016-10-28
195,bank fines elect democrats,"the psychopathic and insincere jihad islams natural appeal to criminals psychopaths and murderers october   
raymond ibrahim is a shillman fellow at the david horowitz freedom center 
whenever muslims engage in behavior that ostensibly contradicts islamfrom taking drugs and watching porn to killing fellow muslims islams apologists loudly proclaim aha see theyre not true muslims or in the words of cia head john brennan on the islamic state they are terrorists theyre criminals mostmanyof them are psychopathic thugs murderers who use a religious concept and masquerade and mask themselves in that religious construct 
overlooked is that many selfstyled jihadis are indeed psychopathic thugs murderers some may not even believe in allah at all yet this does not exonerate islam for its religious construct was designed to entice such men 
as usual  this traces back to the prophet muhammad after telling his followers that allah had permitted muslims four wives and limitless concubines koran  he later claimed that allah had delivered a new revelation koran  permitting him muhammad alone to marry and sleep with as many women as he wanted in response his young wife aisha quipped i feel that your lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires apostates from islam regularly cite this episode as especially disenchanting them with the prophet 
but it is the concept of jihad that especially comports with those who seek to indulge their carnal appetites for whoever fights in the name of allah andor seeks to empower islamthat is jihadisterroristsis exonerated of all blame and if he dies fighting guaranteed the highest levels of paradise where more sex awaits 
thats because allah made a pact with them according to koran  allah has bought from the believers their lives and worldly goods and in return has promised them paradise they shall fight in the way of allah and shall slay and be slain rejoice then in the bargain you have struck for that is the supreme triumph muhammad elaborated lining up for battle in the path of allah jihad to empower islam is worthier than  years of worship moreover the martyr is special to allah he is forgiven from the first drop of blood that he sheds he sees his throne in paradise he will wed the aynhour supernatural celestial women designed exclusively for sexual purposes and will not know the torments of the grave and safeguards against the greater horror hell fixed atop his head will be a crown of honor a ruby that is greater than the world and all it contains and he will copulate with seventytwo aynhour 
as for those muslims who reject jihad muhammad said they will be tortured like no other sinful human for many more islamic scriptures depicting jihad as the greatest undertaking one that earns unconditional forgiveness and paradise see here  
there is no denying that the historic growth of islam is related to its carnal incentives after more than a decade of preaching in mecca muhammad had about  followers mostly relatives it was only when he became a successful warlord and caravan raider that his followers grew and multiplied so long as such fighters helped spread the banner of islam into infidel lands they were deemed good and pious muslimsregardless of their true intentions priorities or even faith 
many of the original jihadis now revered in islamic hagiography were by modern standards little more than mass killing psychotics consider khalid bin alwalid a meccan pagan he opposed muhammad for years but when the prophet seized mecca khalidlike many of muhammads foes such as his archenemy abu sufyanexpediently converted proclaimed the shahada  joined the winning team and then went ajihadingmutilating plundering raping enslaving crucifying and setting people on fire in the process but because he did so under the banner of jihad this serial killer and rapist is today one of islams most revered heroes 
the reason for this is that nowhere in islam is there talk about the condition of the jihadis heart or if hes right with god allah is not god he is not interested in hearts and minds but in fighters and swords so long as his fighters proclaim the shahada there is no god but allah and muhammad is his messengerand fight under the banner of islam they can take plunder murder and rape the infidels and if they die doing so they go to paradise 
such was the genius of muhammad in the arabian society he lived in members of ones tribe were as inviolable as nonmembers were free game to be plundered enslaved or killed with impunity muhammad took this idea and infused it with a pious rationale henceforth there would be only two tribes in the world the umma which consists of all muslims regardless of raceand the infidels who deserve to be plundered enslaved or killed with impunity for rejecting allah 
this explains why other tribalnomadic societiesturks and mongolstatars whose way of life consisted of preying on everyone outside their tribealso converted to islam and under the banner of jihad continued preying on the other the infidel but now as venerated champions of the faith 
christian europe was aware of islams true appeal from the very beginning theophanes the byzantine scholar d  wrote the following about muhammad in his chronicles he taught those who gave ear to him that the one slaying the enemyor being slain by the enemyentered into paradise see koran  and he said paradise was carnal and sensualorgies of eating drinking and women also there was a river of wine  and the women were of another sort and the duration of sex greatly prolonged and its pleasure longenduring eg koran     and all sorts of other nonsense 
centuries later st thomas aquinas d  made similar observations he muhamad seduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh urges us his teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure in all this as is not unexpected he was obeyed by carnal men as for proofs of the truth of his doctrine muhammad said that he was sent in the power of his armswhich are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants what is more no wise men men trained in things divine and human believed in him from the beginning those who believed in him were brutal men and desert wanderers utterly ignorant of all divine teaching through whose numbers mohammed forced others to become his followers by the violence of his arms 
there is finally another group of muslims who should not be overlooked these do not give a fig for allah nor wish to be martyred in exchange for paradise but they rely on islam to justify robbing enslaving raping and killing nonmuslims as many christian minorities in nations like pakistan and egypt will attest because their victims are just infidelsand its a sin to aid a nonmuslim against a muslim that is a nontribal member against a tribal membermuslim criminals target nonmuslim minorities precisely because they know muslim authorities will not do a thing on behalf of the victimized infidels 
in short enough of these claims that this or that jihadi is in the words of the cias brennan terrorists criminals psychopathic thugs and murderers yes they are but that doesnt change the fact that one group of them is convinced that no matter how immoral or perverse their behavior is as long as they continue fighting and dying in the name of jihad paradise is assured them and another group doesnt care a bit about the afterlife but knows that as long as they only victimize infidels no muslim will hold them accountable in both cases islam aids and abets their behavior",2016-10-28
196,what will replace isis,"the muslim bloc may have won the battle but did israel win the war october   ari lieberman 
by now it should be clear to all but the blindest or rabidly disingenuous that the united nations is an organization that has been coopted by the nefarious interests of muslim nations and their despotic third world allies it is an organization rife with prejudice and hypocrisy an organization that can undeniably and without equivocation be described as todays greatest purveyor of judeophobia historical revisionism and conspiracy theories this fact is best illustrated by three resolutions passed this year by united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco that deny the indisputable jewish nexus to the holy city 
on april  the member body voted in favor of an asinine and wholly onesided resolution that referred to jewish holy sites in jerusalem exclusively by their muslim names and designated the temple mount judaisms holiest site as a muslim holy site of worship to add insult to injury the resolution also adopted wild conspiracy theories including a claim that israel was planting jewish fake graves in other spaces of the muslim cemeteries 
unsurprisingly the resolution which was submitted by seven muslim nations passed by a wide margin with  votes in favor six against and  abstentions two nations were absent for the vote france sweden slovenia and spain shamefully supported the vile resolution 
that the resolution would pass was never in doubt given the large number of muslim and despotic third world nations that constitute the makeup of unesco but it was hoped that the resolution would fail to garner european support and israel could thus claim a moral victory france with its collaborationist past and proclivity to kowtow to the worlds despots did not disappoint and predictably voted with the rabble 
but following the vote a crack appeared in the façade of antiisrael invective so prevalent at the un it appeared that france was having a case of buyers remorse in an address to the french parliament prime minister manuel valls termed the resolution clumsy and unfortunate he then added in rather sharp and pointed terms that france will never deny the jewish presence and jewish history in jerusalem it would make no sense it is absurd to deny this history 
france is one of europes strongest advocates for the palestinians the palestinian authority and their muslim allies at unesco should have understood from valls statement that future resolutions with similar toxic content would no longer enjoy automatic european support instead of declaring victory and moving on they pressed their luck by introducing another vile resolution in october 
the october  resolution  sponsored by the usual suspects contained nearly identical language as the april resolution it condemned israel for various contrived transgressions and again severed the jewish and christian nexus to the city this time however the muslim bloc was in for a rude awakening while the resolution passed the muslim bloc was unable to garner a majority in the member body 
of the  nations that voted in favor of the resolution mexico later withdrew support lowering the final tally to   were composed of states with muslim majorities while a fifteenth nigeria is  percent muslim making passage of the resolution a forgone conclusion what was notable was the fact that this time around the resolution failed to garner a single western european concurrence other developing nations like india which had hitherto supported arabsponsored drafts also abstained israels behindthescenes political offensive aimed at exposing the lunacy of the muslim initiative was paying dividends 
following the resolutions passage the palestinians and their muslim allies suffered additional political reversals mexico  asked for a revote because it wished to withdraw support for the motion mexicos secretariat of foreign affairs said in a statement that his governments changed position reiterates the recognition that the government of mexico gives the undeniable link of the jewish people to the cultural heritage of east jerusalem 
brazil soon followed suit echoing mexicos position in a statement the brazilian government noted that it would no longer support such onesided resolutions italy which had abstained went one step further and announced that it would actively oppose such resolutions in the future prime minister matteo renzi told an italian radio station that these resolutions were incomprehensible unacceptable and wrong he added that to say that the jews have no links to jerusalem is like saying the sun creates darkness 
even unescos directorgeneral irina bokova voiced disapproval by stating that the heritage of jerusalem is indivisible and each of its communities has a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city she later received death threats for voicing objection to the motion 
on wednesday the palestinian authority and jordan introduced a third draft resolution to unescos world heritage committee seeking to generate further political terrorism the proposed resolution once again attempted to sever the jewish nexus to the city and its holy sites the member whc body was expected to pass the resolution by consensus but in a surprise move croatia and tanzania asked for a secret ballot which infuriated the muslim bloc instead of the motion passing by consensus the vote was  in favor two opposed eight abstentions and one nation absent 
the two nations opposing were tanzania and the philippines of the  ayes seven were muslim it was a pyrrhic victory at best 
given the large number of muslim countries represented at the un and the hostility that most of these nations harbor against israel it is a virtual certainty that toxic resolutions of this nature will continue to be sponsored and passed but as evidenced by recent arab political reversals gone are the days that the palestinians can rely on automatic european and nonaligned support 
israel has been effectively reaching out to the socalled nonaligned nations and it is having a significant positive impact part of the israeli success lies in the fact that the jewish state has much to offer these nations in the fields of water technology agriculture energy counterterrorism cyber warfare and arms this outreach has translated to political dividends at the un 
nevertheless the unesco resolutions serve to highlight the noxious nature and malevolence of many un member states it also underscores the need for the united states to maintain its commitment and assurance to israel that it will never allow the un to impose terms and dictates on israel 
there have been rumors circulating that barack obama in his twilight months would seek to impose a deleterious settlement on israel utilizing the un security council the white house has remained uncharacteristically mute on the subject raising fears that there may be some merit to the speculation 
the administrations objective would be accomplished by actively supporting a proposed antiisrael resolution likely introduced by france or by choosing to abstain rather than exercising a veto in addition to betraying longstanding commitments to israel and running counter to strong bipartisan opposition the notion that the united states would throw israel under the bus and allow those who engage in despotism and blatant antisemitism to have a say on israels fate is beyond asinine hopefully the outrageous conduct exhibited at unesco steers the administration in the right direction",2016-10-28
197,the splcs libelous new report on antimuslim extremists,"originally published by the jerusalem post  
in one of the immortal lines of godfather   mafia boss michael corleone discusses the fate of his brother who betrayed him with his enforcer i dont want anything to happen to him while my mother is alive corleone said 
message received the brother was murdered after their mothers funeral last week it was reported that the obama administration has delivered a message to the palestinian authority the administration has warned the pa that the us will veto any antiisrael resolution brought before the un security council before the us presidential elections on november  message received open season on israel at the security council will commence november  the palestinians are planning appropriately israel needs to plan too israels most urgent diplomatic mission today is to develop and implement a strategy that will outflank president barack obama in his final eight weeks in power lobbying the administration is pointless obama has waited eight years to exact his revenge on israel for not supporting his hostile strategically irrational policies and he has no interest in letting bygones be bygones before turning to what israel must do first we need to understand what israel can do a good place to begin is by considering what just transpired at unesco where twice in a week unesco bodies resolved to erase  years of jewish history in jerusalem and the temple mount the fight that israel waged at unesco is not the fight it needs to wage at the security council the stakes at the security council are far higher like the un general assembly unescos decisions are nonbinding declarations that have no legal or operational significance as such there is no reason to expend great resources to fight them for israel the goal of the fight at unesco is not to defeat antiisrael initiatives that is impossible given the palestinians automatic majority the purpose of the fight at unesco is to humiliate european governments that side with antisemitic initiatives and to weaken the congenitally antiisrael body itself the government achieved both of these objectives italian prime minister matteo renzis disavowal of his own governments abstention from the vote on the first resolution  like the similar position taken after the fact by the mexican government  was a diplomatic victory for israel so too the fact that unescos own secretarygeneral irina bukova felt compelled to disavow her own agencys actions by rejecting the resolutions denial of the jewish peoples ties to jerusalem was a significant victory for israel her statement was deeply damaging for unesco and its reputation finally the fact that tanzania and the philippines voted against the resolution was a testament to israels capacity to convince other governments to abandon their traditional propalestinian voting pattern the palestinians won the vote at unesco because they are more powerful diplomatically than israel they have an automatic antiisrael majority but they werent empowered by their victory to the contrary they were bloodied by it in a sign of their weakening hold on member nations the palestinians and jordanians felt compelled to send a threatening letter to the members of unescos world heritage committee lest they dare to vote against the resolution powerful players dont make threats they dont need to israels experience at unesco teaches us that there are governments that are open to counteroffers israel doesnt need to hide in americas shadow it is capable of working on its own to blunt the impact of the palestinians automatic majority and it will need to use all of its resources to fend off a usbacked assault at the security council unlike unesco the security council can pass legally binding resolutions israel needs to be prepared to bring all of its resources to bear to prevent such a resolution from being adopted against it obamas intention to abandon israel at the security council means that israel comes to this battle severely hobbled but there is one advantage to the uss betrayal over the years israels ability to trust the us to veto antiisrael resolutions at the security council was been a mixed blessing on the one hand the us has secured israel from diplomatic assaults but on the other hand our ability to trust washington has made us diplomatically lazy and ineffective safe in washingtons shadow we have behaved as through all diplomacy is public diplomacy that is we have pretended that statecraft begins and ends with making the moral or strategic case for our side against the other guys but public diplomacy is just one diplomatic tool the syrian regime for instance has no moral case for securing international support bashar assad didnt convince russian president vladimir putin to support him by arguing that he is better than alternative regimes he bought putins support by offering him permanent air and naval bases in syria then there is morocco another weak state with no public diplomacy case to make last march un secretarygeneral ban kimoon outraged rabat when he acknowledged the plain fact that western sahara which morocco occupies is occupied territory morocco quickly secured the support of spain and france and launched an allout onslaught against ban how did morocco manage moroccos most powerful diplomatic resource is its control over migration flows from north africa to europe anytime it wishes rabat can open the migratory floodgates just as easily as it can keep them shut and the french and spanish know it in less than a month ban issued repeated abject apologies game set match morocco from reports to date it appears that shortly after the us elections on november  the malaysians or egyptians will submit a palestinianbacked resolution that defines israeli communities in united jerusalem judea and samaria as illegal if the resolution is brought to a vote the us will fail to veto it such a resolution or a resolution obligating israel to withdraw to the  armistice lines would cause israel grave harm so what resources does israel have to prevent this from happening of course we have public diplomacy and that might work with some friendly nations but it wont get us over the top we need to learn from the syrian and moroccan examples and consider what we have to offer security council members in exchange for their support in scuttling the approaching onslaught against us one such resource is the us congress israels allies in congress are sickened by the obama administrations devastating middle east policies a solid majority of lawmakers can be trusted to support actions that will reinforce israels position israel has other resources as well that we can trade on we have natural gas and we have technologies that the governments of the world require to surmount the challenges of the  century there is no reason to give these resources away when we can trade them for diplomatic support as for the palestinians as the unesco vote showed they are less popular now than at any time in the past  years all they have to offer is threats and antisemitism both are powerful weapons but they are no longer invincible israels goal must be to use our resources at the security council in a manner that will make it impossible for obama to enable an antiisrael resolution to pass a method for achieving this goal has two components the first component is to convince a friendly country on the security council to propose a balanced resolution that would counter the palestinianbacked israelbashing one such a resolution could include four points first it could deplore efforts to deny jewish history in jerusalem and the temple mount second it can condemn the paplo for their continued unlawful funding of terrorists third it can urge israel to restrain settlement construction in areas that in previous negotiations have been identified as likely territory for a future palestinian state fourth it can call on israel and the pa to reinstate negotiations immediately without preconditions israel has friendly ties with a few security council members among them uruguay and new zealand in the final weeks of the obama era it is possible that israel will be able to convince one of them to submit a balanced resolution along these lines obama would be hardpressed to oppose such a resolution in favor of one that singles israel out for rebuke but that still is insufficient obama can make uruguay and new zealand a better offer if he wishes and so we move to the second aspect of the plan if we learn nothing else from the obama era we must recognize that the time has come for israel to stop sufficing with just one security council veto most states have several and we need a few more russia today is the best place to start our search for a second veto putin is a dealmaker as his agreement with assad showed he is willing to consider attractive offers obviously israel wont offer russia bases but we do have other things to offer putin in exchange for a veto for instance in exchange for a russian veto at the security council israel can offer putin to lobby the us congress to cancel us sanctions against russia over russias annexation of crimea israel has no dog in that fight and the sanctions are not getting the us anywhere putin might go for the deal for two reasons first by stepping into the breach and defending israel against obama he will humiliate obama second if israel succeeds with the congress he will reap economic rewards for his part putin wouldnt even have to openly side with israel all he would have to do is announce that in the interests of regional stability russia will not support an unbalanced resolution on israel and the palestinians if putin supports a balanced resolution obama will be checkmated his plan to take revenge on israel for not following him off the strategic cliff will be foiled israel will have survived his presidency none of this will be easy and success is far from assured there are many more ways for israel to fail than succeed our diplomatic weakness remains a millstone around our neck but as the unesco resolutions showed attacking israel is no longer cost free we are not powerless in the grip of circumstances we have cards to play and now is the time to play them for all they are worth",2016-10-28
198,the psychopathic and insincere jihad,"a look at the universitys new mission october   jack kerwick 
jonathan haidt a professor of social psychology at new york university argued in a recently published essay that while its traditional telos end or goal has been truth within the last few decades the university has assumed another social justice 
the university however can only have one telos 
the conflict between these two goals has raged for decades haidt claims last year though it became unmanageable when student groups at  universities and colleges around the country issued  demands  to administrators demands for social justice that by and large were met 
the following statement is posted at blackliberationcollectiveorg  
we demand at the minimum black students and black faculty to be reflected by the national percentage of black folk in the state and the country 
we demand free intuition for black and indigenous students 
we demand a divestment from prisons and an investment in communities 
a statement of principles follows the black liberation collective blc opposes antiblackness sexism ableism capitalism white privilege inequality and heteronormativity it rejects as well nonviolence considered as a principle in contradistinction to a tactic  
antiblack racism is woven in the fabric of our global society says the blc when social systems are racialized by white supremacy whiteness becomes the default of humanity and blackness is stripped of its humanity becoming a commodity becoming disposable 
the blc is antisexist insofar as it affirms the value of all black womens lives whether cisgender transgender or genderqueer in addition to rejecting eurocentric beauty standards that are made to lessen the beauty of black women and black womens features being antisexist also means realizing that police brutality the prison industrial system school to prison pipeline and the like are aspects of structural racism that affect black women as much as they impact black men 
black liberation entails queer liberation and trans liberation we also seek to destroy the heteronormative norms that dehumanize black queer people the blc asserts the homophobia within the black community comes by way of the same hands responsible for white supremacy 
presumably transphobia within the black community is also a legacy of white supremacy in cooperation with cissexism and the gender binary transphobia has been used as a means of invalidating and erasing our trans family members the blc pledges to eliminate such systemic biases 
these social justice warriors sjws are staunch opponents of the capitalist notions of infinite profit homogenized markets and a privatized means of production capitalism they insist is the economic system thats been used to justify the oppression marginalization and exploitation of blacks 
nor is the solution to this oppression to be found in supporting blackowned businesses the blc explains that we cannot adopt the patriarchal exploitative tools of our oppressors as we seek liberation rather the solution is to dismantle antiblack capitalist corporations that benefit from our oppression 
it isnt only the capitalist corporations that these students want destroyed they demand as well the eradication of all institutional practices and policies that discriminate against the black community and the removal of all federal state and local government officials who do not abide by our principles 
the state and all its institutions that deny black humanity and black agency must be dismantled and replaced with those that produce black liberty 
concerning its attitude toward america the blc is clear this country was built to systematically oppress groups of people and the black liberation collective will not stand for it 
haidt misspeaks in characterizing  as the year when the university experienced a crisis of identity an unmanageable conflict of goals to judge from the vast majority of liberal arts humanities and social sciences departments social justice long ago eclipsed truth as the raison detre of the academy interestingly it is these sjw demands from last year that bear this out 
perhaps it is because ive spent the last couple of decades in the academy in the capacity of both student and faculty that i may be more privy to this than are some others but its painfully obvious that these student activists did not come up with these demands on their own if they didnt have their professors actually write the demands for them then the black liberation collective unquestionably derived the concepts and language of their statement of demands from their mentors 
to put it bluntly one must attend college major in the liberal arts and humanities and study under far left professors in order to think in the terms that are characteristic of social justice warriors 
leftist ideologues are training their students to bend the university to their will this is the first point there is though another a rich irony that is lost upon these selfstyled radicals 
for all of their bluster over systemic racism and structural white supremacy ie phenomena that are omnipresent and hence largely unconscious these black students their white collaborators and their professors fail to realize that their thinking for lack of a better term on these issues is about as eurocentric as one can get the  critical race theory  to which the blc subscribe is a version of marxism the philosophical vision of a  th century germanjewish man the marxist tradition within which they are enmeshed was fleshed out over a span of generations by mostly white heterosexual men 
but theres more to it than this 
the idea that racism sexism homophobia transphobia ableism and the like against which sjws rail are evils to be defeated is itself peculiar to the moral traditions of european civilization if these isms and phobias are immoral it can only be because those who are guilty of them fail to judge the individual as an individual color gender sexual orientation ability and so forth are neither constitutive of nor essential to the moral identity of the individualbut only if the framework of the doctrine of individualism is accepted 
yet this conception of the sacrosanct individual is as eurocentric as the proverbial apple pie is american 
the social justice warriors intellectual landscape is as much a european colony as was any west african country in the  th or early  th centuries those in the black liberation collective have most definitely internalized the modes of thought of their oppressor 
now they would have been well aware of all this had they received a genuine education in college rather than a training in social justice",2016-10-28
199,the battle at unesco,"what feminists can learn from melania trump october   ilana mercer 
in recent interviews donald trumps wife melania trump observed wryly that almost every malicious liefilled article about herself or he husband was written by a  female indeed women seem to have a particular stake in bringing mr trump down 
the contrast between mrs trump and the many histrionic shrews prosecuting her husband is stark in both her interviews with cnns condescending anderson cooper and fox newss ainsley earhardt mrs trump was the embodiment of strength 
when a liberal woman declares shes a strong woman usually uttered in a tartlike staccato inflection shes using a cliché look at her actions youll see that strong to liberal distaff means kicking and screaming until she brings others into compliance with her worldview and ways 
a strong liberal woman is one who hammers you about your obligation to forkout for her trojans and her trivora and if birth control fails our liberated libertine then youre on the hook for her abortions and abortifacients and dont dare doubt any of the intemperate charges leveled by this prototype liberal succubus against a man any man to doubt her is to harm her 
it was not without significance that hillary clintons first general election speech in june was before planned parenthood at the time media buried the story of one named rajiv k fernando  who had donated to the clinton foundation and was given a seat as hillarys nuclear weapons advisor watching this i was thinking endemic corruption the  trillion debt the dire jobs report the terrifying prospect of negative interest rates and the fate of savers but hillary and her gynobrigade in media and across the country were cheering for a universal right to taxpayerpaid dilation and curettage dc 
melania trump on the other hand is authentically strong 
in her refusal to impart salacious tellall tidbits to interviewers in the way she guards her privacy and that of her family in her serene gracious and beautiful manners and bearingmrs trump exemplifies a european womans good breeding shes a class act her enemies are the cultural underclass 
nor does mrs trump display any of the histrionics about men exhibited by her american counterparts there are images on the internet of presidents being inappropriate with women in particular you can watch a grainy youtube clip of barack obama appearing to be showing off his crotch to giggling female reporters in another the president with frances nicolas sarkozy is eying the shapely behind of a young woman passing by much to media chagrin melania refused to get worked up about the  access hollywood tape in which her husband engaged in lockerroom talk 
men will be men if theyre not saying it theyre thinking it 
more material than her mien were melania trumps words of reason on the sovietstyle witchhunt launched against her husband with media mediation she said this all sexual assault allegations should be handled in a court of law to accuse someone man or woman without evidence is damaging and unfair this was the exact verdict of famed defense attorney tom mesereau about the bill cosby pileon quit the feeding frenzy give the man his due process investigate the women counseled mesereau esq at the time 
the very embodiment of the malevolent liberal matriarchy rising is the sainted michelle obama the first lady was lauded for an unhinged antitrump address to the nations women in a world where americans have been beheaded on camera women raped en masse on europes streets and christians exterminated in the middle eastthe first lady bewailed being shaken to her shallow core by raunchy words i cant stop thinking about it groaned michelle about mr trumps access hollywood indiscretion it has shaken me to my core in a way i could not have predicted 
the ritualistic decapitation on the altar of a catholic priest by muslim migrants in france thats something i cant stop thinking about the machinegunning of five macys shoppers and employees by a turkish muslim immigrant arcan cetin in my neck of the woods that has shaken me to my core in a way i could not have predicted again mrs obamas pitiful case against mr trump has strengthened nothing but her dramaqueen credentials 
candidate clinton crowed that mrs obamas long whinge for women was a compelling and strong case about the stakes in the election about who we are as americans indeed the implicit case michelle put to women is this a mammoth national debt a shrinking job market rising lawlessness and racial strife an annual intake of mostly thirdworld immigrants exceeding  million the dangers to life and limb of importing more islam fuhgeddaboudit what counts whimpered michelle obama voice tremblingyes mrs obama almost brought herself to tearswas to ferret out microaggression and find a safeplace to hunker down 
as i write sen elizabeth warren has stormed a stage somewhere for hillary clinton phony pocahontas is hollering about the power of nasty women to immiserate clinton and warren make for a resentful domineering powerhungry pair whove made it big in life through the use of state power the human backdrop to their displays of female force invariably looks the same 
whereas trump rallies are packed with hopefilled beaming faces a clintonwarren affair is festooned with malevolentlooking aggrieved women and their frightened lowt houseboys the background music enfeebled squeaking courtesy of a female pop singer like katy perry whose outoftune yelps and bedroom whispers would be unheard if not for the marvel of autotune autotune is the holy grail of recording that corrects intonation problems in vocals or solo instruments in real time without distortion or artifacts it was invented by a male engineer

200,checkmating obama,"search zineb el rhazoui charlie hebdo survivor discusses why the world needs to destroy islamic fascism undeterred by fatwas and death threats the author has released an incendiary and thoughtful new book bound to provoke debate october   
reprinted from nytimescom 

she leads a clandestine existence on the move and under hour guard as frances most protected woman yet zineb el rhazoui the charlie hebdo journalist who happened to be in casablanca on january  last year the day terrorists avenging the prophet massacred nine people at the satirical magazine in paris believes she has a duty to defy islamists desperate to silence her 
shaken but undeterred by the fatwas and relentless precise death threats issued via social media to kill the bitch since she helped produce the publications first survivors issue following the attack  and spoke about it in arabic for the arab press  the moroccanfrench writer refuses to assume an anonymous identity fleeing paris or abandoning her human rights activism and her unforgiving critiques of the religion she grew up with are also out of the question 
i dont have the right to renounce my struggle or to give up my freedom says the reporter and sociologist of religion in an interview with women in the world during a recent trip to new york as part of french president francois hollandes delegation when he received the appeal of conscience foundations world statesman award for  if the french state protects me it is not little individual me what is being protected is my freedom to be irreverent and freedom of expression so i should exercise this even more because i enjoy this protection 
its totally crazy i have done nothing against the law and have nothing to hide yet i live with security while those who threaten us are free el rhazoui declares with an air of shock and anger that underscores the arbitrariness and brutality visited on a yearold woman condemned to living on the run and mostly in the shadows and if you call them by their names you are islamophobic and racist i am racist i can teach them a few things about arab culture i can show them how to discover its richness and the diversity of their culture i believe this culture deserves universality because you can be arab muslim and a free thinker 
resisting terror 
sweeping in to the offices of women in the world in manhattan accompanied by bodyguards the worldrenowned journalist is living proof of her pledge to keep living her life beyond its limits as a key way of resisting terror elegant and beautiful with her long wavy hair flowing freely and in an impeccably tailored black dress el rhazoui is reminiscent of s cinemas cerebral heroines  her eloquence and composure only occasionally betraying the trauma of the past  months each time we speak about the aftermath of the massacre at her magazine and how she is coping personally her voice quavers but when the subject comes back to her fight for reform in islamic civilization she is fearless 
in this spirit el rhazoui obliged to spend most of her time in hiding like salman rushdie after his  publication of the satanic verses  has taken the highrisk option of publishing an explosive new book about islam 
detruire le fascisme islamique  destroy islamic fascism  being released in france this week takes the battle of ideas directly to the ideologicallydriven zealots who inspired the assassins of her dear friend charb stephane charbonnier late editor of charlie hebdo who preferred to die standing than to live on my knees 
obtained exclusively by women in the world the book dedicated to muslim atheists is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of islam by imitating the first salafists or pious ancestors the prophet mohammed and his companions whose violent exploits are contained in bellicose texts from a barbaric thcentury bedouin tribal context exhibited codes of behavior el rhazoui insists have no place in the modern world and can be directly connected to terrorism the most abject crimes of islamic state are but a stcentury remake of what the first muslims accomplished under the guidance of the prophet she writes noting that sexual and domestic slavery the massacre of nonmuslims notably jews pedophilia pillage polygamy and summary executions were all adopted from preislamic societies the book is also the journalists way of carrying on the legacy of her dead comrades who reveled in their right to mock established religion and fanatics everywhere  with islam no exception to their traditional french anticlerical ridicule  through satire and caricature 
formerly the magazines religion writer el rhazoui is in the throes of joining the exodus of staff breaking from the magazine under its new management flush with cash from international donations the fundamentally altered publication she disappointedly explained  will probably never again draw the prophet  out of fear of more reprisals 
and those who think that only a handful of madmen are capable of killing for a cartoon of mohammed forget that everywhere that islam reigns as the religion of the state caricatures and cartoons in the press are repressed el rhazouis book dedicated to muslim atheists is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of islam religion of peace and love 
we need to admit that islamism today is applied islam el rhazoui  who describes herself as an atheist of muslim culture writes responding to politicians religious figures islamophobia opponents and media commentators who claim after every jihadist attack that real islam has nothing to do with such terror 
when we apply islam to the letter it gives islamism and when we apply islamism to the letter it gives terrorism so we need to stop saying islam is a religion of peace and love what is a moderate islamist an islamist who doesnt kill 
the essaylength book is in the grand french polemical tradition of emile zola whose jaccuse denounced the antisemitism of the french state and establishment during the dreyfus affair on the eve of the th century el rhazoui who holds moroccan and french citizenship takes aim at a very stcentury phenomenon what she abhors as the intellectual fraud of islamophobia which pretends to be about antiracism but in her reckoning is used as a weapon to silence all critics of islam and the ideas behind it as automatically hostile towards all muslims epitomized by the french collective against islamophobia ccif this deliberate strategy vilifies as islamophobic voices such as el rhazouis who dare question the religion the ccif and fellow travelers define only through the prism of their own fundamentalism 
the notion of islamophobia doesnt even exist in muslim countries the author points out because outside the west criticism of the religion or mohammed is officially categorized as blasphemy 
unable to pass blasphemy laws in europe groups like the ccif employ a dangerous semantic confusion she said on the ccif site it is written islamophobia is not an opinion it is an offense 
this is very dangerous because it has even entered the dictionary as hostility towards islam and muslims yet criticism of an idea of islam or of a religion cannot be characterized as an offense or a crime i was born and lived under the islam of morocco and live in france and i have the right criticize religion and this dictatorship of islamophobia that says i have no right to criticize if we criticize christianity it doesnt mean we are christianophobes or racist towards the christian race 
the widespread pressure to selfcensor is severe el rhazoui says 
you can no longer speak about islam without saying its a religion of peace and love but when you open any book in islam what do you find violence blood oppression of women and hate for other religions 
of course you can find this in other religions however we are talking about something written many centuries ago during a barbaric time for humanity as long as we dont talk about this and keep repeating that islam is a religion of peace and love many people will continue to believe the koran is a constitution and that rather than being a book written  centuries ago reflecting a particular context it is a legal constitution to apply today 
zineb el rhazoui feels she is carrying on the legacy of her dead charlie hebdo comrades 
after completing high school in morocco el rhazoui studied languages and the sociology of religion obtaining a masters degree from pariss prestigious social science graduate school ehess in her twenties she returned to the country of her birth to work as a journalist at le journal hebdomadaire becoming a campaigner for secular liberties such as the right to break the fast and even snack in public during the month of ramadan this act of nonviolent resistance earned her her first fatwa ahead of her involvement in the movement supporting the arab spring in  the wave of personal attacks and threats that came after her collective protest against ramadan rules prompted her to leave morocco again for france where she began to report for charlie hebdo bringing her memories of having vomited up compulsory religious classes in a country where being muslim is not a choice unless youre jewish or christian 
extreme personality cult 
socalled islamic fascism seen in its most extreme form in groups like isis shares characteristics in common with all extremeright fascisms el rhazoui argues because it combines an intense personality cult around mohammed as the incarnation of the nation it also employs widespread systems of suspicion and denunciation exemplified by sartorial branding  for example burkinis or niqabs  that allow for immediate identification and targeting of nonadherents there are also familiar fascist tropes of repressive sexism against women and homosexuals armed militias adoption of a flag and a strategy that confers the benign status of muslim women to heavily veiled adherents in the west and characterizes them disingenuously as victimized objects of exclusion 
the literary corpus of islam is so stuffed with damning accounts it would be difficult to cleanse it without altering the fundamentals of dogma el rhazoui writes 
if the terrorists of daesh isis behead those they judge to be miscreants that is because they draw on their legislation in the texts like the th surah of the koran alanfal verse  remember what your lord revealed to the angels  i am with you so support those who have believed i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve you can strike them above the neck and strike off every fingertip 
you can be arab muslim and a free thinker 
drawing on her personal experience and scholarly knowledge of islams core arabic texts the politics of the postarab spring middle east and the wellspring of reformism and dissidence embraced within the multifaceted islamic civilization el rhazouis book is an impassioned response to all the extremists who want to see her and her fellow opponents of politicoreligious repression dead 
the greatest racism is el rhazoui argues the racism of the islamist ideology that forbids marriage with people who are not muslims and that rejects women that is the definition of racism and fascism and we must say it the writer adds 
today islam in the world only has a role as a civilization a civilization is defined by many things and not uniquely by religion  but also by its geographical heritage its artistic culinary and sartorial traditions and by literature 
the muslim religion has its place in the modern world if it submits itself fully to the laws that rule humanity today universal principles of equality between men and women sexual and individual freedom and equality for all no matter your creed or religion until islam has admitted this and accepted that the freedom of men and women is superior to it islam will not be acceptable 
islamophobia whiners 
destroy islamic fascism aims to puncture the hypocrisy and fauxintellectual fakery the authors word of islamophobia whiners and other collaborationists from across the political spectrum  particularly the hard left cryptoislamist antiracists on a quest for a new muslim proletariat certain feminists cultural relativists and socalled moderate imams all these willing accomplices do is distort the noble cause of fighting racism to give undeserved legitimacy to an ideology that at its most extreme results in the horrors of islamic state the author says but also makes the lives of millions of muslims living in islamic countries downright miserable 
what do these islamophobia whiners say to the millions of individuals who live in islamic theocracies and dream of liberty el rhazoui concludes in her book who speaks about the nightmare of a woman who decides to cross the streets of algiers casablanca or cairo in a skirt those who would like to drink a glass of alcohol in countries where you have to flout the law to do it  about homosexuals pariahs of muslim societies who often only have the choice of death prison or exile who speaks about this youth born muslim but dreaming of a normal life these teens attacked for having had a romance 


the summer furore over burkini bans in france agitated the author who deplored the cynical rush of islamists and their western sympathizers in the media academia and politics to celebrate the controversial swimsuit as a form of liberation and simultaneously a banal piece of cloth preferred by muslim women even though most never wear it 
western media in an intolerable readiness to oblige have defended the burkini as a freedom and a legitimate cultural expression of a part of humanity she said but pointed out that in muslim countries the beaches are not filling up with burkinis but they are emptying themselves of women from one year to another they are disappearing from the public space because the veil has never been anything except an extension of the walls of their harem to the exterior 
as for mainstream or moderate muslim clerics el rhazoui tells women in the world that during the burkini debate in france not one imam stood up and said hey wait a minute you can be muslim and wear a regular bathing suit 
history will judge those who have monopolized the debate given a platform to islamist fundamentalism and even given it a guarantee of acceptability the author of destroy islamic fascism told women in the world this is just betrayal and it is collaboration with one of the worst forms of fascism that exists today she said 
according to the writer who is repeatedly accused of bigotry the islamophobia ruse is driven by great ignorance and a lack of understanding of the culture of islam and what islam with a big i is  they ignore its complexity and that there have always been opposition currents and progressive and liberal pushes from within 
the accomplices dont recognize the struggles playing out today in arab countries will inevitably be won by the democrats and free people no fascism or totalitarianism has ever been able to win in the long haul of history the people who are the allies and collaborators of this totalitarianism today will be judged by history and seen as accomplices to this criminal ideology to which they have given a veneer of respectability 
for el rhazoui the true racism emerges from a condescending approach to islamic culture that decrees an islamic woman in a burqa is congenitally not free and that her race is the burqa we present the fundamentalists as being a race and this only shows the contempt we have for this culture it is absolutely intolerable she says 
survivor syndrome 
women in the world asked el rhazoui how she manages to keep up her spirits and continue her struggle for the freedom to dissent after everything that has happened since january  
it is a question people often ask me she said with a perceptible tremor in her voice but when you live through these moments in which you are confronted by a reality as cruel and simple as life and death you realize can put many things in perspective 
straight after the attacks like many of my colleagues i felt guilty for having stayed alive i said to myself those who are dead are dead for all our work and some are dead when it wasnt even their work but it was my work because i am a journalist and i am still here and then you understand this is all part of survivor syndrome which is normal when you survive a massacre like that 
as you start to heal you say i am lucky to be alive and if i am still here perhaps that is because i still have something to do i understood long before the attack on charlie when i engaged in a struggle for individual liberties and democracy in morocco that when you fight against totalitarianism whether it is political or religious you should never give your enemies the pleasure of stopping living we fight so that everyone can have a free and happy life and we must continue to live this same life 
zineb el rhazoui c attends the funeral of french cartoonist and charlie hebdo editor stephane charb charbonnier on january   in pontoise outside paris martin bureauafpgetty images 
still a day doesnt go past when she doesnt think of her old colleague charb and their many heated discussions 
he was someone who was extremely lucid and for whom the concepts were clear he was a true humanist who didnt fear being accused of being racist because for him it was absurd 
el rhazouis deconstruction of islam is also a defense of muslims she reasoned as salvation will come when we stop aligning the identity of an entire community with the most fundamentalist people who pretend to represent it 
we have to extend a hand to all these muslims who are free people who have questioned their heritage and who are fighters for liberty battling for the same values as us but in a context controlled by islamists she says 
life in a moving jail 
since january  the survivor from charlie hebdo has traveled frequently to speak at universities and meetings of the freedom forum in europe and the us under the protection assured by the french state and the countries that receive her she says she would never complain about living under permanent armed guard and having her freedom of mobility curtailed because so many other writers and political figures around the world  and especially in islamistcontrolled or influenced countries  are taking the brave decisions to do as she does but without any security 
i always find some spaces of freedom there are always little escape hatches life continues says the woman who has just written her second book since the charlie attacks and recently became a firsttime mother in what she laughingly called the surprise baby boom at a publication that used to have one of the lowest birthrates in french media 
today i wander around in a moving jail  its a moving cage  but in reality i am more free in my head than those who threaten me because their cage is inside their head they have this cage in their brain and even if they have freedom of movement it is their spirit and their reason and intelligence that is imprisoned i am much freer than them

201,social justice vs truth,"propalestinian propaganda lowering standards of truth in america manipulation by doctored narratives in every sphere october   
reprinted from israelnationalnewscom  
commendably organized american jewry is finally focused on the campaign to boycott delegitimize and sanction israel however focusing primarily on israel and not also on america and europe is shortsighted 
the bds campaign has not devastated israel economically israel is thriving both economically and in terms of regional alliancesbut fifty years of a wellfunded propaganda campaign has all but destroyed israels good name and has rendered her and jews everywhere vulnerable to diplomatic academic and mob attacks 
it has also lowered the standards for truth among americans this is a very important point 
an islamicstyle of jew hatred has merged with western politically correct antiracism to breed an unnatural passion for palestinians fakestinians which has infiltrated every corner every crevice of our lives and world it has infected americans and europeans on both sides of the aisle and of every class race and ethnicity 
this is utterly astounding amazing really something like this does not happen overnight 
the bds campaign is rooted in the arab league plo and soviet propaganda campaign that began in the mids in the mids the un proposed its infamous zionismracism resolution 
in  the day after israel won yet another war of selfdefense israelnot the arab aggressorswas seen as the alleged occupier 
by the late s edward saids treacherous lying work had begun to have its way with western academics and with westernstyle academics in israel european governments and international organizations 
i only realized how successful his campaign was in  when israel was demonized at a un conference on women in copenhagen the soviets the iranians the arab league the plo roamed the hallways chanting death to israel european feminists called upon palestinian refugees but refused to hear jewishisraeli refugees from arab and muslim countries by  the un world conference against racism in durban was an even more outofcontrol hate fest and riot against israel 
as we approach  un resolutions against israel are as commonplace as they are grotesque unescos recent decision to dejudaize jerusalem the western wall and the first and second temples is a grim and maddening continuation of this trend at the same time proisrael professors and students in america are increasingly being harassed even fired 
such lies have infiltrated my private social world for example at a recent holiday dinner our guests agreed that we live in criminal and anarchic times and that no great power has stopped global barbarism no entity is willing to bring the world back from the brink 
a likeminded gathering yes not exactly one man a genial wellheeled welleducated jewishamerican suddenly began hectoring us about the palestinians what if they did not hate the jews and destroyed all their textbooks that demonize jews and israelis what if they were peaceful wouldnt we have to admit that palestinians have always existed and therefore deserve a state of their own you cant deny that the palestinian people have always lived there can you oh my where to start the company included two authorscholars who between them have published  books and thousands of articles many of them dealing with the history and nature of islam tribal gender and religious apartheid israel and antisemitism etc among us was a third author who had also served four tours of duty in the idf i held my breath and prayed that we would not go to war at the table this man was punching way above his pay grade and i could not understand why 
the two authorscholars presented facts cited statistics i pulled down book after book from my shelves we got nowhere look he said i have some really good muslim friends theyre americans totally westernized they are palestinians they strongly feel that this is their identity why deny them the identity of their choice and then i understood that the propalestinianantizionist propaganda behind the relentless bds campaign is successful precisely because so many americans of all ages are without knowledge without respect for knowledge do not know this and frankly dont care 
fair is fair he said in other words whats good for the jews has to be good for everyone else if not the jews dont deserve whatever it is either 
heres a man whos not an antisemite or an antizionist not an active member of any organizationyet who needs to believe the canard that nonjewish palestinians have always existed or that they existed by the nineteenth century or no later than  the year that another stateless peoplethe jewschose a national sovereign identity 
he would not listen to reason it was quite astounding how is this possible 
his mindset is part of our ruling american zeitgeist if rachel dolezal can say shes black even when shes white and direct a chapter of the naacp if a man can say that hes really a woman trapped in a mans body if all truths are relative if everything is subjective if objectivity is no longer important if doctored narratives have supplanted factbased histories if revisionism is preferred to truththen yes anyone can say that they deserve their own nation state because they feel or believe that they do 
i am grateful to my combative guest for reminding me that ignorance is often arrogant and as such is a great enemy that educated people have been especially vulnerable to false ideas that psychologically speaking we must approach them as if theyve been brainwashed by a cult 
facts alone will not work we must consider all known techniques for deprogramming 
this is one of our greatest challenges",2016-10-28

theres only one possible solution 
lets load  million in unmarked foreign currency on an unmarked cargo plane and deliver it to iran then make follow that up with a few more and make sure iran scores  billion in sanctions relief 
thats how we got here  its smartpower which is neither smart nor powerful 
earlier this month us navy ships had to fire defensive interceptor missiles after they were targeted by attacks launched from houthicontrolled yemen 
this was likely the first time in history the navy had to take such measures and officials are now saying they think iran is behind the attacks 
we believe that iran is connected to this vice admiral kevin donegan told nbc news in fact the us has intercepted many shipments of weapons from iran to the houthi militants who oppose yemens internationally recognized government in a conflict that has seen thousands of civilian deaths and mass starvation of the civilian population 
the intercepted shipments were filled with coastal defense cruise missiles boats that we believe were explosive boats other weapons that were clearly on the decks of their ships that we saw donegan said 
im sure theres no chance that the billions obama lavished on iranian jihadists have in any way freed up the terror state to open its own jihadi candy store not a chance 
and im sure that when iran gets the nuclear weapons that obama is enabling it will use them as responsibly as its using its cruise missiles",2016-10-28
203,zineb el rhazoui charlie hebdo survivor discusses why the world needs to destroy islamic fascism,"hillary clinton seeks even more unfit secretary of state than her october   daniel greenfield 
having never read any medieval german folk tales hillary clinton is counting her chickens before theyve hatched and preparing to hand out jobs that no one has handed her to hand out shes busy planning her fantasy cabinet for her fantasy administration 
and her big pick makes sense 
reportedly she would like to make joe biden the secretary of state biden is the obvious choice hes arrogant dumb and brimming with bright ideas like just giving iran money or splitting iraq into little pieces obviously this wouldnt be a competency pick the last time we had someone qualified as secretary of state was during president bushs time in office 
then democrats decided they would give the job as a consolation prize to failed presidential candidates because our foreign policy is just that important 
and who could be counted on to make an even bigger mess than hillary clinton or john kerry joe biden its a perfect plan if you want a fall guy to blame everything on they dont come any more obvious than joe biden 
and if you want someone shadowed by the soft bigotry of low expectations youve gotta go joe

204,propalestinian propaganda lowering standards of truth in america,"the bundy verdict is another defeat for obama october   daniel greenfield 
obama inc has a lot more luck with the media than it does with trials its lynchings of police officers have not gotten very far baltimore was the biggest and most resounding defeat but it wasnt the only one and the vastly differing treatment of the bundy protesters and the dakota pipeline protesters from killing to government backing have not had their intended effect 
instead obama lost at trial again 
this time its the bundy case that was when the left realized it hated civil disobedience just before rediscovering it again when it came to environmental protests but big gov lost this one  again 
a jury thursday delivered a stunning acrosstheboard acquittal to the leaders and participants in the malheur national wildlife refuge occupation and a remarkable blow to the federal government as it tries to tamp down a national movement led by a nevada family to open public lands to ranchers miners and loggers 
the verdicts finding ammon bundy older brother ryan bundy and five others not guilty of a federal conspiracy drew elation from defense attorneys who spent five weeks arguing that the armed takeover amounted to a timehonored tradition of first amendment protest and civil disobedience 
the highprofile case riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the isolated bird sanctuary in rural eastern oregon the jurys decision proved no less dramatic and sets up a showdown in the next stage of the landrights movement 
it means that big green gov will have to think twice next time around or do a much better job of picking a jury 
the oregon prosecutors sat silently in front of their boss us attorney billy williams and the head of the fbi in oregon greg bretzing as the judge announced the not guilty pleas one by one 
but it was quickly back to more of the same 
ut the trial fireworks werent quite over a brawl broke out at the very end when six to seven us marshals surrounded ammon bundys lawyer as he stood before the judge arguing and shouting for his client to walk out the door a free man they tackled him and stunned him with a taser gun as mumford yelled what are you doing us district judge anna j brown ordered everybody out of the courtroom 
all i was asking for was papers mumford said after emerging from federal custody nearly two hours later just show me you have the authority to take mr bundy into custody",2016-10-28
205,us navy iran giving terrorists missiles to fire at us ships,"hillarys secretary of state after  send a check for  million to iran   
were talking about tehran joe biden of course who is good pals with the iran lobby biden is reportedly hillarys fantasy cabinet pick for secretary of state because the democrats have decided that secretary of state is a job too important to be trusted to experienced diplomats but should instead be reserved strictly as a consolation prize for failed presidential candidates 
heres a flashback on bidens views  
democratic vicepresidential candidate joe biden was quoted monday as telling senior israeli officials behind closed doors that the jewish state will have to reconcile itself to a nuclear iran in the unsourced report army radio also quoted biden as saying that he opposed opening a additional military and diplomatic front army radio said israeli officials expressed amazement over the remarks attributed to him israel will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of iran army radio quoted biden as telling the unnamed officials 
bidens people loudly denied the report but he had a history of being tight w ith the iran lobby 
some might call it reaching out to american muslims but to many iranians living in california a fundraiser for sen joseph biden ddel at the home of a prominent proiran lobbyist on feb  sent a wrongheaded message to the ruling clerics in tehran 
when we learned that sen biden was planning to hold a fundraiser at the california home of dr sadegh namazikhah we immediately contacted his office to express our dismay a prominent iranianamerican activist tells insight why dismay 
dr namazikhah is wellknown in the los angeles area for his support of the ruling clerical regime in tehran and is one of the regimes leading unofficial lobbyists in america we thought that sen biden might not know his background getting the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee to appear at this event will certainly be seen by the regime in tehran as a show of support 
on the eve of the fundraiser which brought an estimated  into bidens reelection coffers a biden staffer told the activist that the senators staff had all the facts necessary to make a decision and he was planning to attend the fundraiser despite the protests 
several participants who paid to attend the event tell insight that biden arrived at  pm stayed until  and delivered a sweeping condemnation of president george w bushs axis of evil formula 
as senator biden was not only undermining bush but fundraising off it at the home of supporters of a terrorist enemy state 
biden also impressed many of those present with his friendly attitude toward the islamic republic of iran the senator said that iran always wanted to be an ally of the united states and to have good relations with the us according to housang dadgostar a prominent lawyer as iranianamericans we dont want anything to happen to the iranian government or to the iranian people as a result of this war on terrorism says mohsen movaghar a los angeles businessman both men belong to the member board of directors of namazikhahs iranian muslim association of north america iman 
namazikhah denied any official contact with the iranian government but he tells insight that he regularly travels to iran  something many expatriates do  and that he actively supports moderates within the ruling clergy such as iranian president mohammad khatami in their efforts to bring reform to the islamic system 
namazikhah and other iman board members say bidens office contacted them to inquire if they would hold a private fundraiser for the senator who is up for reelection this year after meeting with them at a protehran gala in new york last december that event was sponsored by the americaniranian council aic a proregime lobbying group trying to get congress and the bush administration to lift the trade embargo on iran 
but biden had the perfect post  reaction  
after september th biden suggested sending  million to iran no strings attached as a gesture of good faith to the arab world 
at the tuesdaymorning meeting with committee staffers biden launches into a streamofconsciousness monologue about what his committee should be doing before he finally admits the obvious im groping here then he hits on an idea america needs to show the arab world that were not bent on its destruction 
seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for  million to iran biden declares

206,hillary clinton seeks even more unfit secretary of state than her,"weiner sexting of yearold girl leads to new fbi investigation of hillary emails   
the giant flaming garbage dump that is clintonworld is offering up a wonderful new development sure to excite anyone who wanted to combine the weiner scandal and the hillary email scandal 
yes virginia you can now have both of them in one like peanut butter and jelly or shampoo and conditioner in one theyve been merged into one horrible stinking landfill for your entertainment and the downfall of the republic 
the fbi has reopened its investigation into hillary clintons use of a private server while secretary of state after discovering new emails  apparently during the probe of former rep anthony weiners sexting  in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election 
fbi director james comey wrote in a letter to top members of congress friday that the bureau has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation 
comey did not detail those emails saying only that they surfaced in connection with an unrelated case 
an fbi source though confirmed to fox news that the new emails were discovered after the bureau seized devices belonging to disgraced rep weiner and his wife huma abedin a top clinton aide who recently announced she was separating from the former congressman the new york times first reported on the weiner investigation connection noting the fbi had been probing texts weiner sent to a yearold girl 
as donald trump and congressional republicans seized on the fbis decision interim democratic party leader donna brazile simply tweeted good grief after the news of the anthony weiner connection broke 
cant argue with her there 
it would be hilarious if anthony weiner and thereby huma abedin led to the downfall of hillarys lifelong ambition you just know someone is going to commit suicide in a dc park 
but does anyone in the democratic party really look forward to  to  years of this this is how big of a mess hillary is now weve reached the point where her ongoing email scandal is now intertwined with a sexting investigation of a yearold girl and thats just during the election",2016-10-28

you may remember ambassador samantha power from the time she proposed invading israel since then shes gone on to a glorious career of representing the castro regime at the un or is it the obama regime it naturally gets confusing when the us ambassador to the un sides with the enemy against her own country 
for more than  years the united states had a policy aimed at isolating the government of cuba for roughly half of those years un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain applause thank you 
under obama power was told to abstain from opposing a resolution critical of the united states and they say obama is some sort of antiamerican traitor i dont see it if he were we would be seeing signs of it by now 
anyway power then went on to audition for the job of the un ambassador from cuba by claiming that critiques from a brutal communist dictatorship about our human rights are wellfounded 
let me be among the first to acknowledge  as our cuban counterparts often point out  that the united states has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens and we know that at times in our history us leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust

lynch and obamas corrupted doj have switched to overtly undermining the fbi investigation of hillary clinton remember those hillary emails that have come up in the weiner investigation 
as of saturday night the fbi had still not gotten approval from the justice department for a warrant that would allow agency officials to read any of the newly discovered abedin emails and therefore are still in the dark about whether they include any classified material that the bureau has not already seen 
we do not have a warrant a senior law enforcement official said discussions are under way between the fbi and the justice department as to the best way to move forward 
this is michael isikoff so the spin is an attack on comey though if comey couldnt get lynch to sign off on a warrant the public announcement could very well have been his way of pressuring the doj to do the right thing now that the emails are an election issue the only way to move forward is to allow the fbi to review them 
but the dems and the media are currently attacking comey and the isikoff piece is a typical example rather than tell the truth that the doj is obstructing the hillary investigation its smearing the fbi instead as so many have pointed out imagine if nixon had been a democrat this is the way the media would have covered watergate

again if we had anything resembling a rule of law huma would be in jail people in federal investigations have gone to jail for much lower acts of dishonesty and deception  
the rebooted fbi investigation of hillary clintons emails was spurred by emails turned up during the anthony weiner sexting investigation those emails that huma abedin swore she gave up  
but the new information that the fbi found state departmentrelated email on her home laptop also calls into question whether abedin in fact turned over all of the devices she used to send and receive email while working at state 
on june   abedin said under oath in a sworn deposition that she looked for all devices that she thought contained government work on them so the records could be given to the state department these records were subsequently reviewed by the fbi

i looked for all the devices that may have any of my state department work on it and returned  returned  gave them to my attorneys for them to review for all relevant documents and gave them devices and paper abedin answered

210,obamas un ambassador cuba is right about our human rights,"obamas attorney general warned fbi director not to inform congress of new hillary investigation   
the media is shamelessly spinning this corrupt behavior by attorney general lynch as standard protocol and blasting the fbi from deviating from some imaginary standard in which democratic presidential candidates are supposed to be immune from the consequences of their criminality  and congress is meant to be kept in the dark 
attorney general loretta lynch and deputy attorney general sally yates disagreed with fbi director james comeys decision to notify congress about his bureaus review of emails potentially related to hillary clintons personal server law enforcement officials familiar with the discussion said 
there was no direct confrontation between lynch or yates and comey instead the disagreements were conveyed to comey by justice department staff who advised the fbi chief his letter would be against department policy to not comment on investigations close to an election the officials said 
it is in line with policy though for lynch to have met with bill clinton 
but yes a hillary backer disagreed with a course of action damaging to her candidate 
comeydecided to disregard their concerns and sent the letter friday anyway shaking the presidential race  days before the election and nearly four months after the fbi chief said he wouldnt recommend criminal charges over the democratic nominees use of the server 
the officials acknowledged there was little lynch and yates could do given the fallout over lynchs controversial meeting over the summer with former president bill clinton

its an obviously absurd move but considering that the doj has become a transparently political organization that abuses and attacks law enforcement on a regular basis including in the eric garner case the fbi this is just how things work in the hall of mirrors that the left has made  
the democratic coalition against trump filed a complaint with the department of justice office of professional responsibility on friday against fbi director james comey for interfering in the presidential election following the fbis decision to open up an investigation into secretary clintons emails this close to election day federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act 
it is absolutely absurd that fbi director comey would support donald trump like this with only  days to go before the election said scott dworkin senior advisor to the democratic coalition against trump it is an obvious attack from a lifelong republican who used to serve in the bush white house just to undermine her campaign comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting america not investigating our soon to be presidentelect hillary clinton 
its silly grandstanding and seems easy enough to dismissexcept that bizarre and unlikely tactics no longer are there was outrage over moveons attack on petraeus and even most dems thought that it was unhelpful this attack on comey i suspect will meet with little criticism some dems will consider it a helpful preemptive move even though with his track record comey is as likely to hurt hillary as he is himself",2016-10-30

the ecoloons protesting the dakota pipeline have the support of the media and the white house but many of the local sioux dont see them as defenders they just wish they would go home  
ask around and youll hear stories of pipeline protesters whove traveled great distances theyve come from japan russia and germany australia israel and serbia and of course there are the allies not exclusively native american or indigenous whove flocked here from all corners of the us 
demonstrating is their proud daily work 
the obnoxious leftists of the world have united and they want no pipelines or showers 
no one makes this clearer than robert fool bear sr  district chairman of cannon ball the town he runs estimated population of  is just a few miles from the action its so close that given the faceoffs with law enforcement you have to pass through a police checkpoint to reach it 
its about time people heard from folks like him he says 
fool bear has had it with the protesters he says that more than two years ago when members of the standing rock sioux tribe could have attended hearings to make their concerns known they didnt care now suddenly the crowds are out of control and he fears its just a matter of time before someone gets seriously hurt 
go down to the camps he says and you wont see many standing rock sioux 
it irks me people are here from all over the world he says if they could come from other planets i think they would 
and the sioux are stuck helping leftist idiot protesters 
not long ago he found three teenage girls from ontario canada camped out inside his storage shed a white woman from spokane washington came to see him for help saying shed come here with nothing and her car had broken down when he was at the casino recently someone approached him about two young kids who were on their own because their parents had been arrested 
even though fool bear is against the protests that doesnt mean hes not preparing to help people out too he anticipates opening the community gymnasium for people without beds come winter and a growing pile of sleeping bags and blankets sits in his office 
those protesters from arizona georgia and california wont know what hit them when the cold rushes in he says 
instead of helping the sioux privileged leftists have become a burden for them to take care of",2016-10-30
213,obamas attorney general warned fbi director not to inform congress of new hillary investigation,"media spin the fbis actions are deeply troubling not hillarys   
so the hillary email investigation was reopened due to a sexting investigation of her close aides husband so the media focused its outrage and disgust not on the gruesome weinerabedinhillary trio but on the fbi reporting line from the alternate universe that the left inhabits the media is brimming with headlines attacking the fbi for investigating hillary 
hillary clinton called the fbis actions deeply troubling they should be for her but instead the media made the propagandistic decision to upend the scandal coverage by portraying the fbis actions in investigating hillary as the scandal rather than hillarys own actions 
the agenda is blatantly obvious but its also telling that the left has decided that the real scandal is investigating their own",2016-10-30
214,dems file complaint wdoj against fbi for investigating hillary,"obama donations funneled through fake bonuses   
this is some great investigative work and its the kind of story that flies under the radar and its just a small component of the democratic machine but it is what the setup looks like  
jon tester didnt come all the way from montana for the scrambled eggs and bacon the us senator virtually unknown in boston was in a conference room at the thornton law firm that june morning to cash in at one of the most reliable stops on the democratic fundraising circuit a law firm that pours millions into the coffers of the party and its politicians 
tester a massive jovial man who raises livestock on his family farm was more compelling than many of the other breakfast guests all of them political candidates the firm hoped would defend the interests of trial attorneys but the drill was basically the same the personal injury lawyers listened politely for a few minutes then returned to their offices and tester walked away with  in checks 
but a striking thing happened the day tester visited in  partner david c strouss received a payment from the firm labeled as a bonus that exactly equaled his  contribution to testers campaign the maximum allowed a few days later partner garrett bradley  until recently the house assistant majority leader on beacon hill  got a bonus too exactly matching his  gift to tester 
thats quite a coincidence 
from  through  strouss and bradley along with founding partner michael thornton and his wife donated nearly  million to democratic party fundraising committees and a parade of politicians  from senate minority leader harry reid of nevada to hawaii gubernatorial candidate david ige to senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts over the same span the lawyers received  million listed as bonuses in thornton law firm records more than  of the contributions precisely matched bonuses that were paid within  days 
no corruption to see here now lets move on to another fake scandal 
thorntons lawyers were especially generous to vice president joe biden one of washingtons strongest advocates for trial lawyers contributing more than  to his campaigns from  to  
during president obama and bidens reelection campaign in  michael thornton hosted a fundraiser for the obama victory fund at his house in cambridge where biden was the guest of honor some of the biggest donors  some thornton partners gave   were escorted into a private room and offered the chance to be photographed with biden said someone who was there thornton records show the lawyers were reimbursed for those donations

if the clinton campaign becomes any more deranged hillary will start running attack ads against the fbi this kind of tactic is already perilously close to an attack ad 
hillary clintons presidential campaign ratcheted up its attack on the director of the fbi on sunday circulating a draft letter critical of james comey to former federal prosecutors 
it is out of our respect for such settled tenets of the united states department of justice that we are moved to express our concern with the recent letter issued by fbi director james comey to eight congressional committees the clinton campaigns letter speaking for prosecutors said 
the letter was signed and provided to the daily beast by elkan abramowitz a former chief of the criminal division of the us attorney for the southern district of new york it is expected to be released sunday evening 
so we have the bizarre spectacle of hillary deciding that she needs to campaign against the head of the fbi who was just being praised for clearing her because when youre a paranoid personality who assembles lists of enemies this is how you react but its also telling that the clinton campaign finds this so threatening that it is waging war on the fbi",2016-10-30

we now know that lynch and obamas doj are obstructing the investigation of hillary clintons emails the biased media is predictably spinning this as the fbi being in the wrong and hillarys backers at the doj being in the right 
but it also appears that the doj was obstructing any investigations of hillary including that of the clinton foundation 
the fbi field office in new york had done the most work on the clinton foundation case and received help from the fbi field office in little rock the people familiar with the matter said 
in february fbi officials made a presentation to the justice department according to these people by all accounts the meeting didnt go well 
some said that is because the fbi didnt present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the clinton foundation and that the career public integrity prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasnt a very strong case others said that from the start the justice department officials were stern icy and dismissive of the case 
that was one of the weirdest meetings ive ever been to one participant told others afterward according to people familiar with the matter 
justice department officials told the fbi at the meeting they wouldnt authorize more aggressive investigative techniques such as subpoenas formal witness interviews or grandjury activity but the fbi officials believed they were well within their authority to pursue the leads and methods already under way these people said 
of course the doj wouldnt authorize investigations of the democratic partys chosen thats the type of elemental corruption at work in the system",2016-10-30

the clintons thats a crime family basically former assistant fbi director james kallstrom said its like organized crime i mean the clinton foundation is a cesspool 
kallstrom best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of twa flight  in the late s said that hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee was a pathological liar 
he also blasted attorney general loretta lynch claiming that she impeded the investigation into clintons private server 
the problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation he said thats the problem they never had a grand jury empanelled and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled im sure is loretta lynch would not go along with that 
kallstrom also said that fbi director james comey and the rest of the fbis leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation not the rest of the bureau

the persecution of christians in the islamic world has become endemic accordingly muslim persecution of christians was developed to collate someby no means allof the instances of persecution that surface each month it serves two purposes 
 to document that which the mainstream media does not the habitual if not chronic persecution of christians 
 to show that such persecution is not random but systematic and interrelatedthat it is rooted in a worldview inspired by islamic sharia 
accordingly whatever the anecdote of persecution it typically fits under a specific theme including hatred for churches and other christian symbols apostasy blasphemy and proselytism laws that criminalize and sometimes punish with death those who offend islam sexual abuse of christian women forced conversions to islam theft and plunder in lieu of jizya financial tribute expected from nonmuslims overall expectations for christians to behave like cowed dhimmis  or thirdclass tolerated citizens and simple violence and murder sometimes it is a combination thereof 
because these accounts of persecution span different ethnicities languages and localesfrom morocco in the west to indonesia in the eastit should be clear that one thing alone binds them islamwhether the strict application of islamic sharia law or the supremacist culture born of it

dear dr napolitano 
your school purports to promote the values of diversity inclusiveness and tolerance yet provides resources funding and legitimacy to students for justice in palestine students for justice in palestine is a campus organization whose sole purpose is to conduct hateful propaganda against jews and the jewish state for the terrorist organization hamas the explicit goals of hamas are the destruction of the worlds only jewish state and genocide against its jewish population for these reasons among others three campuses of the university of californiairvine los angeles and berkeleyhave been named among the top ten schools supporting terrorists by the david horowitz freedom center you may read the full report here httpwwwstopthejewhatredoncampusorgnewstoptenschoolssupportingterroristsfallreport 
while it masquerades as a typical campus cultural group sjp is an integral part of hamass efforts to annihilate israel through the boycott divestment and sanctions bds campaign this is an insidious effort that attempts to delegitimize israel and smear it as a rogue apartheid nation these claims are ludicrous more than a million palestinians enjoy israeli citizenship including the rights to vote and to sit on the israeli courts and parliament harvard professor alan dershowitz has said of the bds movement it is antisemitic antizionist antihuman rights antiintellectual antiscience antinegotiation antipeace anticompromise and antipalestinian workers when they are denied opportunities to work both larry summers and hillary clinton have denounced bds as antisemitic jew hatred yet your school provides a platform and funding for its sponsors 
with university support sjp also conducts israeli apartheid hate weeks on campus quads these events feature prohamas advocates the construction of apartheid walls featuring prohamas antisemitic propaganda and the creation of mock checkpoints and dieins that disrupt student movements on campus sjp actively disrupts proisrael campus eventsa threat to free speech and a violation of your universitys stated values and rules of conduct 
in addition to being scripted by hamas terrorists sjps proterror campaign is funded and guided through a hamas front called american muslims for palestine in recent testimony before the house foreign affairs committee jonathan schanzer who worked as a terrorism finance analyst for the united states department of the treasury from  described how hamas funnels large sums of money and provides material assistance to students for justice in palestine sjp through the hamas front group american muslims for palestine amp for the purpose of promoting bds campaigns on american campuses amp was created by sjp cofounder hatem bazian a proterrorist lecturer at uc berkeley who called for a suicide bombing intifada inside the united states it employs highranking officials from other muslim charities that were previously shut down for providing material assistance to terrorists 
schanzer described amp as arguably the most important sponsor and organizer for students for justice in palestine sjp which is the most visible arm of the bds campaign on campuses in the united states he detailed how amp provides speakers training printed materials a socalled apartheid wall and grants to sjp activists and even has a campus coordinator on staff whose job is to work directly with sjp and other probds campus groups across the country furthermore according to an email it sent to subscribers amp spent  on campus activities in  alone 
students for justice in palestine continues to accept funding and aid through the hamas front group american muslims for palestine despite its links to terrorist organizations and agendas students for justice in palestine continues to receive campus funds and campus privileges including university offices and the right to hold events preaching the genocidal values of hamas on university property these privileges would normally be denied to groups that preach hatred of any other ethnic group let alone one that supports barbaric terrorists who slaughter men women and children with the goal of cleansing the earth of people who disagree with them 
in light of these facts we ask that you withdraw all university privileges granted to sjp and other campus groups who promote the genocidal hamas agenda and that you put an end to the terrorist influences which have infiltrated your campus and which threaten the security not only of jewish students on your campus but of all americans

daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
september   has come and gone countless bodies lie scattered in fragments around where two of the countrys tallest skyscrapers once stood some have burned to ash others had their throats slashed by islamic terrorists still others fought and died on a plane to prevent another islamic terror attack from taking place 
but joe has an idea joe is a guy with lots of big ideas and this one is a real doozy 
the senator from delaware has come a long way since his days as a sixties shyster drumming up business in wilmington his formerly bald head is covered in hair so shiny is gleams under neon lights his teeth are capped and shine almost as brightly after a generation holding down a squeaky seat in the senate seniority makes him a man to be reckoned with and therefore a man to be listened to 
even if you wish he would shut up 
im groping here joe says for once he isnt referring to his notorious habits with women that will go on to make him the star of countless viral photographs massaging squeezing caressing instead hes talking about foreign policy the chair of the senate foreign relations committee has no clue 
joe is worried that the muslims will think badly of us after they murdered thousands of us and he has a plan to make them feel better 
seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for  million to iran senator joe biden says 
the remark isnt quite as random as it seems the senator from delaware a state not known for its large muslim or iranian population has a friendly relationship with the iran lobby that relationship will only grow friendlier during the bush era as he attacks america and appeases its enemies 
iranianamericans who hate the jihadist government that has taken over their country and oppressed the persian people are outraged when he attends a fundraiser at a proiranian lobbyists home in california while treasonously attacking his own government for naming iran one of the members of the axis of evil 
joes usual amtrak obsession wouldnt get him in the door in california but treason hair plugs and capped teeth make him a big hit outside delaware and joe remains very fond of iran 
he informs israeli officials that israel will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of iran and thats all the way back in  before the deal that puts iran on the path to a shiite bomb was a nuclear twinkle in obamas eye and a radioactive itch in hillarys socks 
that was a big year for biden it was his first and biggest shot at the big chair in the white house joe had tried it in  and was stomped by dukakis of all people after being caught plagiarizing a speech by british politician neil kinnock  got him a useless position in the white house as a consolation prize 
this time around joe biden is expected to get the same consolation prize from hillary clinton that she got from barack obama the office of secretary of state of the united states 
of all the jobs that joe biden wants and is utterly unfit for amtrak train engineer secret agent and the guy in charge of counting all the money at the bar its hard to think of one that hes less fit for 
joe biden blamed darfur on the gingrich revolution he fell in love with the taliban 
the taliban per se is not our enemy joe insisted there is not a single statement that the president has ever made in any of our policy assertions that the taliban is our enemy 
he suggested that  of the taliban were probably okay and only  were incorrigible most of the taliban he seemed to think were like joe biden just in it for the money 
but joe biden has a soft spot for islamic terrorists whether theyre the shiite jihadists of iran or the sunni jihadists of the taliban joe loves all the terrorists of the world and the terrorists love him back 
it wasnt that long ago that we were being lectured to by the media on bushs ruination of relations with the rest of the world if biden were to become secretary of state he would become the third democratic presidential campaign loser to get the job as a consolation prize for his failures as a politician the last time a professional held down the job would have been the bush administration 
and yet perversely each loser secretary has been more incompetent than the last hillarys disastrous time as secretary of state could only be exceeded by john kerry who gave away everything to the russians and who was contradicted by the white house so many times it would have humiliated a lesser man or just any man the only loser who could follow two class acts like that was joe biden 
joe bidens amateur diplomacy has been one disaster after another even his visit to israel a friendly ally not known for fractious political visits by american politicians became an international incident with biden sulking in his room while hillary yelled at prime minister netanyahu for  minutes over the phone but somehow biden with his gift for appeasing iran and the taliban alienates allies 
just this year joe biden launched yet another attack on israel a cynic might almost think that tehran joe loves islamic terrorists and hates those who resist them and fight against them 
biden has claimed that terrorism is not an existential threat he accused president bush of being shortsighted for using the military to fight islamic terrorists he argued that the perception that we want to stay in iraq helps al qaeda some years later his administrations decision to pull out led to the rise of isis he called for closing gitmo while insisting that it had become the greatest propaganda tool that exists for recruiting of terrorists around the world 
senator joe biden was a voice for appeasement vice president joe biden was part of an administration that empowered and unleashed the malignant power of islamic terror secretary of state joe biden would be able to act out his worst fantasies he could even write that check to iran though the obamabiden era has seen cash transfers to iran that make joes  million check seem like chump change 
hillary clintons rise doesnt just mean that she will be making big decisions it will mean that joe biden will have gone from a wilmington shyster to running the foreign policy of a country he has betrayed",2016-10-31
221,americans seek to help persecuted christians government helps muslims  frontpage magazine,"hillary clinton and the presidents  longer game  at home and abroad a nation less affluent less free and far less secure october   lloyd billingsley 
the president of the united states the most powerful man in the world used a pseudonym to communicate with secretary of state hillary clinton on her private unsecured email server as andrew mccarthy contended  that was the reason the fbi declined to prosecute clinton because the president would have been part of the same action and that wouldnt be politically correct 
the current president of the united states is also on record that contrary to custom he will linger in washington dc for a few years wherever he chooses to live the email intrigue suggests continuing backchannel communications with hillary clinton should she become president that invites a look at what the man the new york times dubbed obamas narrator the white house adviser who sat closest to the president and signed off on his every word had to say about the presidents vision of the future 
few of the decisions he had made would satisfy the politics of the moment david axelrod explained in his massive  believer  but at home and abroad obama was playing a longer game as he explained in columbia missouri on october   we are five days away from fundamentally transforming the united states of america 
if this man was a liberal as barry rubin wondered in silent revolution how the left rose to political power and cultural dominance  why did he see a need fundamentally to transform a nation shaped by liberals such as franklin roosevelt with his new deal and lyndon johnson with his great society he saw the need because he was not a liberal but a lifelong leftist radical 
as david horowitz explained in volume  of the black book of the american left  the president was born bred and trained in the progressive movement his mentors were communists and their progressive successors so no wonder he presided over the institutionalizing of the policies of the left in government for eight years what that means in practical terms is becoming painfully evident 
the economy remains sluggish and under obamacare the presidents signature plan premiums are skyrocketing  this suggests that as many believe obamacare was simply a demolition plan in the longer game designated successor hillary clinton will impose government monopoly healthcare what some candidates erroneously call socialized medicine 
as rubin noted the goal of the left is to convince americans the exact opposite of what their experience proved that the country had fundamentally failed and the old leftist solutions were the answer the result may be a very longterm and even permanent change of the united states into something else a nation far less affluent and far less free and far less secure as david axelrod also indicates 
vladimir putin makes an appearance in believer but obamas narrator does not outline putins background in the kgb the believer includes nothing about putins role in east germany a stalinist police state that walled in its subjects and shot those attempting to escape the narrator avoids putins belief that the breakup of the soviet union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century 
in believer  putin tells the president you are a highly educated man i come from the security sector the believer then asks the president for his assessment of putin 
hes smart tough clear about his interests and without a trace of sentimentality the president says that is not very strong language for a kgb veteran and expansionist autocrat 
in his narrators account the president uses the word motherf",2016-10-31
222,freedom center urges college presidents to end aid to campus supporters of terror,"search selective outrage over splcs antimuslim extremist list leftists and atheists appalled that splcs hit list of islam critics includesleftists and atheists october   robert spencer 
sam harris thinks its unbelievable that maajid nawaz and ayaan hirsi ali made it to the southern poverty law centers hit list of antimuslim extremists he said nothing about me or the other people whom the splc included which is not surprising since he has quite recently expressed willingness to acquiesce in other contexts to the demonization that the splc list exemplifies 
hemant mehta of the friendly atheist blog ably sums up the outrage over nawaz and hirsi ali being included if criticizing religious beliefs makes them extremists then it wont be long before other vocal atheists end up on that list too and make no mistake thats what nawaz and hirsi ali are doing thats all theyre doing theyre not antimuslim they work with moderate muslims theyre critical of the worst aspects of islam 
the problem with being angry about nawaz and hirsi ali being on the splc list but silent about everyone else who is on it is that what mehta says about nawaz and hirsi ali can quite accurately said about everyone else on the list if criticizing religious beliefs makes them extremists then it wont be long before everyone who dares to utter a critical word about islam will be on the list  and that is indeed the objective of the list to stigmatize and marginalize any and all such critics mehta protests that nawaz and hirsi ali are not antimuslim they work with moderate muslims theyre critical of the worst aspects of islam 
but no one would think that the other  were antimuslim if it hadnt been for the southern poverty law center and the hamaslinked council on americanislamic relations cair and their allied groups insisting that we were all these years in their avidity to conflate opposition to jihad terror and sharia oppression with hating a group of people  a tactic designed to discredit opposition to jihad terror and sharia oppression mehta and co are falling for and validating the same smear tactics hey are decrying when used against their friends 
and as for working with moderate muslims for  years jihad watch has contained this invitation  any muslim who renounces violent jihad and dhimmitude is welcome to join in our antijihadist efforts it is nawaz as well as other moderates who has attacked me in what appears to have been a cynical attempt to gain support for himself among muslims i never attacked him and would have have been happy to work with him otherwise 
in complaining that nawaz and hirsi ali are merely criticizing religious beliefs and are not antimuslim mehta is strongly implying that the others on the splc list are doing something beyond criticizing religious beliefs and are indeed antimuslim on twitter the last couple of days ive seen many people express outrage that nawaz has been lumped in with the likes of spencer but when i ask them what the big difference is between us or for quotes from me that are actually bigoted they go silent 
mehta harris haider and the others who are only angry with the splcs hit list because it included nawaz and hirsi ali are by their selective outrage acquiescing to and legitimizing the splcs demonization of the other people on the list in his own defense hemant mehta wrote me to explain somewhat unsatisfactorily i focused on those two because theyre well known in atheist circles this is a selfdefeating choice for them to have made for the splc has never identified anyone whom it considers to be a legitimate critic of islam and never will the point of lists such as the one they released yesterday is to demonize and silence everyone who dares say something about islam that is not warmly positive 
the turn of mehta harris and haider will come for the same treatment one wonders if when this happens there will be anyone left to speak for them who has not already been smeared as antimuslim with their tacit approval",2016-10-31
223,meet hillary clintons secretary of state,"a resolution on jerusalem that will fuel antijewish incitement and violence october   joseph puder 
if anyone doubted the fact that the united nations agencies harbored a deepseated antiisrael and antijewish animus the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco vote on jerusalem proved it the unesco world heritage committee voted this week october   on a resolution dealing with jerusalem drafted by the palestinian and jordanian delegations and submitted by kuwait lebanon and tunisia all arab muslim states the executive committee of unesco approved  for  opposed  abstained and  missing the resolution that was already voted on earlier this month in which  memberstates approved the resolution algeria bangladesh brazil cuba chad dominican republic egypt iran lebanon malaysia morocco mauritius mexico mozambique nicaragua nigeria oman pakistan qatar russia senegal south africa sudan and vietnam  opposed estonia germany lithuania the netherlands uk and the us among the abstaining  states were argentina france greece india japan kenya south korea spain sri lanka and sweden 
the resolution deeply decries the continuous israeli aggressions against civilians including islamic religious figures and priests decries the forceful entering into the different mosques and historic buildings and into muslim holy sites by israelis including employees of the socalled israeli antiquities israel is urged to end these aggressions and abuses which inflame the tension on the ground and between faiths 
according to hillel neuer executive director of un watch a genevabased watchdog organization the resolution which is likely to be adopted dangerously risks fueling antijewish incitement and violence and legitimizing the escalating palestinian denial of jewish and cultural rights neuer added that this inflammatory narrative praised last week by hamas rewards the past years relentless palestinian stabbing and shooting attacks in jerusalem and other parts of israel which we mustnt forget began with false claims that israel was planning to damage the holy muslim shrines 
the expected resolution mentions eleven times alharam alsharif the muslim designation to what jews call har habayit the holiest shrine in judaism where the temple of solomon stood and also known as temple mount with the islamic bloc controlling the largest voting bloc in the un it is no wonder that a resolution of this kind can be approved oic organization of islamic cooperation being the largest and most influential bloc at the un it might as well declare that the earth is flat and it will garner a majority vote at the general assembly or its other un constituent agencies what this resolution effectively does to jerusalem is to islamize sites historically belonging to other faiths 
the latest draft does not describe the western wall as the most hallowed remains of the jewish holy temple destroyed by the romans in ce but as the western wall of al aqsa mosque in a blatant effort to erase the jewish heritage and biblical truth and as part of a campaign to islamize the site it shamelessly disregards the fact that jewish worshippers have prayed at the wall for over two thousand years the language of the draft resolution continues the deliberate attempt by the palestinian authority pa to deny the jewish historical connection to the land of israel in general and to jerusalem in particular mahmoud abbas has continued on the path of denial that arafat initiated at camp david 
among the charges brought up by the pa and the other arabmuslim states for undertaking the resolution is that the jerusalem light rail which is used daily by thousands of arab residents of jerusalem is having a damaging effect on the visual integrity and the authentic character of the walls of the old city of jerusalem yet the rail tracks pass through an existing highway and facilitates effective transportation for visitors of all faiths 
preceding the shameless resolution and the vote that took place in the paris headquarters of unesco israels president reuven rivlin stated at an event in his jerusalem residence no forum or body in the world can come and deny the connection between the jewish people the land of israel and jerusalem  and any such body that does so simply embarrasses itself we can understand criticism but you cannot change history 
unescos director general irina bokova and the chairman of unescos executive board michael worbs expressed displeasure and apologized for the resolution in an interview with israeli tv channel  on october   the day following the vote worbs said he hoped that the boards tuesday meeting will be delayed in order to reach consensus on the resolution before a formal vote bokova on her part expressed her dismay at the resolution saying that efforts to deny history and the citys jerusalem complex multifaith character harms unesco 
earlier in july  bokova stated that the heritage of jerusalem is indivisible and each of its communities have a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city to deny or conceal any of the jewish christian or muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site and runs counter to the reasons that justified its inscription in  as a world heritage site 
unesco can be counted as one of the most antiisrael un agencies in the course of a typical year the organizations legislative bodies will condemn israel  or more times with no criticism aimed at any other country in the world in  for example unesco adopted  antiisrael decisions  eight at the  st and  nd sessions of the executive board and two at the  th session of the general conference again in  unesco adopted  antiisrael decisions at the  th and  th sessions of the executive board in  unesco again adopted  antiisrael decisions at the  th and  th sessions of the executive board and two resolutions against israel at the  th session of the general conference 
whereas jerusalem was king davids capital and continued to be the capital of the second jewish commonwealth as well as israels capital today it was never the capital of any arab or muslim empire caliphate or entity nor was jerusalem a spiritual center that muslims yearned for the umayyad caliphate had its capital in damascus the abbasside caliphate capital was baghdad and the ottoman empires caliphate capital was constantinople ramle a small town in israel was its administrative capital in palestine  not jerusalem a palestinian state never existed as an independent entity and the pa claims on jerusalem are strictly contrarian  to deny jerusalem as the heart of jewish spirituality and yearning jerusalem exists in every jewish prayer and is invoked on every occasion and holiday 
dore gold former director general of israels foreign ministry addressed last years unescos jerusalem resolution he pointed out that the resolution glossed over any jewish connection to jerusalem and it failed to acknowledge christianitys ties to jerusalem 
most dismaying is the fact that christian nations who voted for the resolution or abstained have abandoned all vestiges of pride and honor and are willing to deny historical truth for narrow political interests brazil mexico and the dominican republic predominantly catholic states are a case in point unfortunately other christian countries including france spain greece argentina and sweden who should know about jerusalem from their church bibles did not have the courage to reject this outrageously false resolution it can only lead to the conclusion that perhaps cowardice and latent antisemitism drove their decision to accept not reject this infamous resolution",2016-10-31
224,hillary clinton and the presidents longer game,"is hillary panicking over the fbi and weiner emails   
these past few days have seen a major shift in the clinton tactics during the original investigation the clinton campaign and its political and media allies launched attacks at republicans for wasting time investigating hillary but did not attack the fbi it misrepresented fbi statements but it certainly did not target investigators in the way were seeing now 
but now we have open hostilities between lynch at the doj and the fbi we have the clinton campaign circulating a letter attacking the fbi we have countless media hit pieces aimed at the fbi 
the obvious question is why the clinton campaign kept its cool at least to some degree before it certainly didnt begin an illadvised campaign against the fbi thats the kind of tactic that may play to your core base but alienates everyone else that is to say everyone who isnt in the media 
so whats going on here 
 the clintons thought they were done its close to the election so theyre lashing out its typically paranoid and nasty behavior by the clintons hillary tried playing humble she tried apologizing but a moment ago her victory seemed inevitable and now shes in a state of fury at having it put at risk 
 there is something in those emails that genuinely frightens the clinton campaign which is why it took the crazy risk of going after the fbi with both barrels its desperate to smear the fbi as much as possible in order to neutralize any revelations or even potential charges the attacks are a warning to treat hillary with kid gloves again or else 
the first is plausible to a degree but for all of hillarys awkwardness she didnt lose it in the past why is she losing it now theres no evidence beyond speculation for the latter and yet the major shift in tactics is rather striking if the clinton campaign were panicking this is what it would look like",2016-10-31
225,selective outrage over splcs antimuslim extremist list," reminders to ignore the trump is doomed polls   
weve recently had two object lessons in the worthlessness of the trump is doomed polling saga a few days ago the media was loudly trumpeting that hillarys victory was inevitable that the polls were in and she was going to ignore trump and focus on building her administration and winning downticket races and then just like last time around the numbers turned around again 
i was recently asked to predict the race i answered that the one thing i could predict is that the media will claim a landslide for hillary right before the election that much is very likely 
its in the medias interest to spread fud by promoting polls that predict not just a hillary win but a landslide creating the perception that voting is useless the more republicans feel that the outcome is futile the less likely they will be to go out and vote but the scandal polling numbers have a history of rebounding this remains a challenging and very unusual election 
the premature panic weve seen in some circles is unhealthy we shouldnt completely ignore poll numbers but neither should we treat them as inevitable 
weve had two major lessons in why thats short sighted",2016-10-31

remember last week when hillary clinton was shopping around for white house drapes and the popular wisdom was that she was inevitable that was fun wasnt it now she hit an unfavorability rating high of  percent thats higher than trump 
it also means that the candidate who claims shes going to bring americans together is disliked by most of the country  
clinton is seen unfavorably by  percent of likely voters in the latest results a new high trump is seen unfavorably by essentially as many   percent marking the depth of these views  percent see clinton strongly unfavorably and  percent say the same about trump  unusual levels of strong sentiment 
the extent of partisan antipathy in this poll produced for abc by langer research associates is remarkable ninetyseven percent of trump supporters see clinton unfavorably  percent strongly so ninetyfive percent of clinton supporters see trump unfavorably  again  percent strongly so 
but remember hillary is inevitable 
now the clinton campaign has decided to go after the fbi under the assumption that people like hillary more than the fbi that may be a slight misjudgment and by slight i mean huge because not only is the fbi more popular than hillary so are major landfills ufo cattle mutilations and a number of international war criminals",2016-10-31
227,is hillary panicking over the fbi and weiner emails,"dnc head leaked nd debate question to hillary october    
were not talking about debbie wasserman schultz the exmuppet in charge of the dnc who was forced to resign because of the way the dnc rigged the process to favor hillary this is donna brazile who was brought in to replace her to bring back integrity to the dnc since brazile is another clinton loyalist that was never going to happen 
but the latest leak reveals that brazile had passed along a second debate question to hillary all this just emphasizes how fraudulent and rigged the whole debate process was 
another leaked email has emerged showing democratic national committee boss and former cnn contributor donna brazile sharing a debate question in advance with the hillary clinton campaign  despite braziles persistent claims to the contrary 
cnn announced in a statement soon after the email became public monday that brazile had tendered her resignation and the network accepted it on oct  days after the controversy over brazile tipping off the clinton campaign initially broke 
according to documents released monday by wikileaks brazile sent clinton communications director jennifer palmieri an email titled one of the questions directed to hrc tomorrow is from a woman with a rash the night before the march  cnn primary debate in flint mich 
her family has lead poison and she will ask what if anything will hillary do as president to help the ppl of flint brazile wrote 
the following night leeanne walters a mom whose twin boys stopped growing and whose daughter lost her hair during the flint water contamination crisis posed a question to both clinton the eventual democratic presidential nominee and her primary opponent vermont sen bernie sanders 
clinton responded with a lengthy answer that moderator anderson cooper had to twice interrupt in an attempt to keep to the agreedupon time limit

independents are the largest political group in the country larger than either democrats or republicans and theyre tilting toward trump and the gop 
adding in ideology the tracking poll shows clinton going from  percent support among liberal democrats early in the tracking poll to  percent now while trumps gone from  percent among conservative republicans to  percent now 
independents  sometimes swing voters in past elections albeit inconsistently  also merit attention theyve gone from a scant  points in clintons favor in the first four nights of tracking  percent to a substantial trump lead now  percent clintontrump 
a key element here is the partisan preferences of independents who emerge as likely to vote they were  points more likely to lean toward the republican party rather than the democratic party at the start of tracking but are  points more apt to do so now 
hillary clinton tried to win over independents by positioning her brand as a moderate centrist who can work with republicans and can get things done while portraying trump as dangerous and irresponsible it certainly worked to a degree 
trumps pitch was that hes not a conventional republican and he can overturn a rigged system the drain the swamp speech was a key element the latter is more likely to ultimately appeal to people who identify as none of the above because theyre disgusted with both parties",2016-10-31

the hillary clinton whineaton continues 
after having mobilized mulltiple exofficials and media types to attack the fbi the clinton campaign whose candidate blatantly benefited from white glove from the fbi is complaining about a double standard 
hillary clintons campaign accused fbi director james comey monday of engaging in a blatant double standard 
clintons campaign manager robby mook slammed comey in the wake of reports that the fbi director refused to publicly comment on potential donald trump campaign ties to russias alleged efforts to meddle with the us election but did weigh in on an updated investigation involving clintons email server 
it is impossible to view this as anything less than a blatant double standard mook clintons campaign manager said on a call with reporters that director comey would show more discretion in a matter concerning a foreign state action than one involving the democratic nominee for president is nothing short of jawdropping 
yes its jaw dropping that mook cant grasp how investigations work 
comey had no reason to comment on the trump thing because it wasnt part of an existing criminal investigation of trump there has been despite hillarys bottomless barrel of lies a criminal investigation of hillary clinton

230,dnc head leaked nd debate question to hillary,"the renewed criminal investigation into hillarys misdeeds  and how it could affect the election november   matthew vadum 
democrats are in panic mode a week out from election day as they try to spin away the fbis newly announced discovery of a hoard of twothirds of a million potentially sensitive emails apparently related to hillary clintons catastrophic tenure as americas top diplomat 
partisan hack james carville is spewing wild conspiracy theories 
i think it is an outrage and i think the fact that the kgb is involved in this election is an outrage and i think the american people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for fbi director james comey thats what i think 
he added this is in effect an attempt to hijack an election it ought to be called for what it is 
just this past july comey was praised by democrats far and wide for his wisdom in opting not to pursue clinton there is evidence federal officials tried to hinder various investigations of clinton and the endlessly corrupt bill hillary and chelsea clinton foundation which functions as a bribe processing center for wouldbe president hillary clinton 
but democrats have suddenly flipped sides denouncing comey as an enemy of the republic now that he has opened an investigation into the newly discovered emails 
carville long known as the ragin cajun is apoplectic because he thinks these emails could change the dynamics of the election 
the old clinton hand may be right 
investigators found  emails on a laptop computer they believe was used at home by disgraced former rep anthony weiner d and his wife longtime senior hillary aide huma abedin the computer is reportedly the same device serial pervert weiner used to send sexual messages to an underage girl 
underlying metadata suggests thousands of those messages could have been sent to or from the private server that mrs clinton used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter reports the wall street journal  some of the information emailed may have been classified 
abedin who has intergenerational ties to the muslim brotherhood reportedly forwarded sensitive government information to her personal yahoo email account and may have viewed them on her home laptop 
over the objections of attorney general loretta lynch comey notified congress of the information about the previously unknown emails at this late stage in the election cycle because after letting hillary off the hook this summer he was facing a huge uprising among fbi employees the overwhelming majority of whom are not unprincipled supplicants to power 
lynch is doing her best to make sure the department of justice probe goes nowhere 
assistant attorney general for legislative affairs peter j kadzik whom zero hedge calls the best friend of john podesta hillarys campaign chairman and former white house chief of staff in bill clintons administration is heading up the email probe 
so the fix is in 
in any event the prospect of restoring his good name may also have prompted comey to act 
people are upset at comey because he took the cowards way out in the email investigation and is viewed as helping the clinton team and the obama white house in their efforts to cover up wrongdoing 
it was back on july  comey announced that despite the massive body of damning evidence accumulating against clinton he would not recommend charges be brought against the former secretary of state for her use of hackerfriendly homebrew private email servers to conduct official business clinton and her aides were extremely careless in their handling of classified documents but there was no evidence of criminal intent he said even though the relevant national security statute does not require intent the next day attorney general lynch confirmed no charges would be laid against hillary lynch as everyone now knows had a clandestine meeting with former president bill clinton at a phoenix airport a week before at which a corrupt bargain was presumably made 
this internal rebellion in the investigative agency was serious enough that comey felt he had to act immediately 
i have some sources in the fbi and the former district attorneys commentator larry kudlow said sunday on nbcs meet the press the fbi is in full revolt right now the fbi has been in full revolt since the decisions made last summer 
ever the hillary shill host chuck todd corrected kudlow 
not full revolt he said theres been a lot i mean itsthere are agentslets not say full revolt 
all right a semifull revolt said kudlow 
because what im getting at is if comey hadnt said what he said to congress and the rest of the world it would have leaked it would have leaked that whole building was ready to leak that they had discovered this new source with anthony weiner and huma abedin so i dont think comey had much chance here and i think the fbi is badly divided 
meanwhile the trickle of bad news for hillary clinton has turned into a raging flood in the last few days 
clinton has been directly implicated in a nasty false flag operation against the donald trump campaign top democrat operatives robert creamer and scott foval were caught on undercover video describing their involvement in an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents the euphemism employed was conflict engagement which means paying leftist agitators the homeless and the mentally ill to cause melees at trump rallies 
fomenting violence and physically attacking political opponents was what the fascist third reich did using the sturmabteilung or sa also called brown shirts and storm troopers 
longtime democrat pollster and campaign consultant doug schoen a familiar face on fox news channel announced he could no longer in good conscience support clintons candidacy 
im deeply concerned that well have a constitutional crisis if shes elected he said sunday if the secretary of state wins we will have a president under criminal investigation with top aide huma abedin under criminal investigation 
republican donald trump is closing the gap in national polls of likely voters 
clintons unfavorability rating in polls now exceeds trumps shes at  percent hes at  percent 
former new york mayor and leading trump surrogate rudy giuliani said over the weekend that enough evidence has surfaced from wikileaks and the fbi to indict clinton for racketeering bill clinton does the speeches they put the money in the pocket she does the favors in the government said giuliani a former federal prosecutor it all links up why did they destroy  emails because it shows the link

231,independents tilt decisively to trump,"how the nevertrumpers sunk themselves november   
bruce thornton is a shillman journalism fellow at the david horowitz freedom center 
the chorus of nevertrumpers is wailing ever louder as election day and hillarys supposed victory approach after more than a year of complaining about trump crashing their political soiree the republicans attacking trump still dont seem to get how their own behavior contributed to the perception that they are outoftouch elites disdainful of the republican masses 
a recent example comes from premier nevertrumper bret stephens of the wall street journal  in his column stephens bids farewell to a republican party stupid enough to nominate trump contrasting it with his imagined golden age of republican policy excellence that trump and his followers have destroyed one policy in particular immigration reveals the distance between the political and pundit elite and the voting masses that helped make trump the nominee 
at a  republican primary debate in houston candidates george hw bush and ronald reagan were asked whether the children of illegal immigrants should be allowed to attend public schools for free mr bush said they should were creating a whole society of really honorable decent familyloving people that are in violation of the law he lamented 
reagan agreed instead of putting up a fence he asked why dont we    make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit and then while theyre working and earning here they pay taxes here for good measure reagan suggested we should open the border both ways 
where in the populist fervor to build a wall with mexico and deport millions of human beings is that republican party today 
take bush seniors statement first it repeats basically the same clichés that the bipartisan gang of eight recycled in  during their push for comprehensive immigration reform another euphemism for amnesty all those hardworking familyvalues illegal immigrants are embryonic conservatives we were told who just need legal status and social recognition so they can come out of the shadows as john mccain said and start voting republican the political apple doesnt fall far from the tree son jeb ended his presidential ambitions by calling illegal immigration an act of love 
this stance on illegal immigration by republican politicos and pundits is obviously lightyears from the experience and position of many ordinary people take mccains oftrepeated trope of living in the shadows seriously illegal alien young people openly protest on live television knowing they are not going to be deported millions visit emergency rooms for free and wrangle food stamps welfare transfers school lunches and all sorts of largess all the while they live protected by sanctuary cities and living in the shadows doesnt deter them from committing felonies given that even if caught convicted and deported theyll soon be back remember juan francisco lopezsanchez the illegal alien deported five times who murdered kate steinle or angel gilberto garciaavalos another fivetime deportee who just this month started a  million fire in sequoia national park he had just been released from the kern county jail but could not be deported because of californias lunatic sanctuary city law which prohibits a sheriff from contacting federal agents 
simply repeating the hardworking family values religious mantra doesnt address the problems of illegal immigration there are such illegal immigrants as i know from over sixty years of personal experience living in the san joaquin valley one of the largest concentrations of illegal aliens in the country i grew up with mexicanamericans theyre members of my immediate family theyre my friends students and colleagues theyre also the victims of the crimes and disorder caused by our porous border 
some illegals do transition into these sort of immigrants but many do not a rigorous vetting process might sort out the wheat from the chaff but bush mccain and stephens have not proposed a workable rigorous mechanism for determining who should stay and who should go that means with any form of amnesty citizenship will likely be granted indiscriminately with only the most egregious felons sifted out if any are stupid enough to apply for citizenship rather than continuing to live in the shadows but all those guilty of duis hitandruns or defrauding the welfare system with fake ids will stayand then bring their extended families under the provisions of the disastrous  immigration act which enshrined family reunification with no limits on relatives of us citizens 
equally tonedeaf is stephenss bringing up ronald reagans open the border both ways thats exactly what he did in  when he signed the simpsonmazzoli act which granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants with promises of border enforcement that never materialized stephens doesnt mention that as a result the number of illegal immigrants increased from about  million to  million creating todays crisis the obvious lesson is secure the border first then figure out what to do with the  million it would be governmental malfeasance to repeat reagans mistake 
the problem with politicians and pundits like stephens is they dont live with the consequences of indiscriminately letting in people from very different cultures and mores people like stephens dont live daily with the disorder and crime that results theyre not aware of the extensive damage to quality of life the illegal immigration version of broken windows such as dogs without rabies shots running free health and safety codes ignored building codes shrugged off garbage and refuse dumped everywhere copper wire stolen from pumps and street lights and chronic petty theftand thats on top of stolen cars hitandruns driving without insurance gangbanging and dealing drugs 
and if mr stephens thinks im just a nativist or xenophobe or racist i dare him to visit the san joaquin valley better yet let him bring his wife and children to live there for a month come and tour a hospital emergency room a social security disability office a public school a county jail and then wax lyrical about these honorable decent familyloving people it would take just a week for mr stephens to develop a fervor for a fivefoot high wall around his house and buy four or five pit bulls and a shotgun then again he wouldnt last that long within a day hed scurry back to his nice white secure tony neighborhood where he doesnt have to pay the cost of his moral preening 
and that hypocrisy is where trump came from in the perception of millions of votersperceptions nevertrumpers have fed so incessantly that they look a lot like realitythe conservative politicians and pundits care more about their privileged status and purity of principle than they do about the welfare and interests of their partys voters and so they would rather see a venal perjurious corrupt mediocrity become obama  and continue the progressive destruction of the constitutional order than see elected the nominee of their own party what sort of principle is that",2016-10-31
232,hillary clinton campaign still whining about the fbi,"obama wont vote with america at the un under obama the united states wont defend the united states november   daniel greenfield 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
a generation ago the communist tyranny in cuba demanded that the united nations condemn america for the embargo the brutal castro regimes rant accused the united states of threatening nuclear annihilation countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate cuban leaders 
on a cold day in october the european leftwing activist serving as un ambassador announced to applause that her administration would no longer be voting to defend the us at the un 
un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain samantha power said 
thank you she added acknowledging the applause 
under obama the united states would no longer defend the united states a generation ago the communists had been in cuba now they were in washington dc 
instead of defending america obamas chosen representative agreed that our communist enemies had a point about our lack of human rights and our imperialist foreign policy 
let me be among the first to acknowledge  as our cuban counterparts often point out  that the united states has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens and we know that at times in our history us leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust she said 
if the cuban representative had been in her place he could not have done much better communist cuban propaganda was now being parroted by ambassador power if the castro dictatorship wanted to save money it could shut down its propaganda department and outsource the labor to washington dc 
the cuban ambassador boasted that cuban communists had rid ourselves of us imperialism and proclaimed that we will never go back to capitalism he declared that the resolution was a powerful message to the peoples of the world the message is indeed unmistakable 
ben rhodes the close obama adviser who sold the media on the iran sellout curtly tweeted his justification no reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose 
who is this we 
the cuban embargo is the law of the land its the official policy of the united states its based on laws passed by congress and implemented by president john f kennedy and his successors 
this we certainly isnt the united states government its elected representatives in the legislative and executive branches working together to end the old policy and implement a new one 
one member of the we must be ben rhodes because he tells us so who is rhodes an aspiring novelist who pushed obama to back the muslim brotherhood takeover of egypt the iran nuke sellout and now apparently choosing communist cuba over america 
no one has ever elected rhodes to anything but under leftwing rule he outweighs congress president kennedy the law of the land and the national interests of the united states 
we is obama who made the final decision its ambassador samantha power its a number of other functionaries all of whom derive their power from a single elected official who is only one third of the government this is the we that announced its treasonous opposition to the us at the un 
america has a we problem 
if the we of the american left wants to vote its own way it should secede to form its own country 
when president john f kennedy proclaimed the embargo on all trade with cuba he based it on authorization from the congress of the united states that is how our system used to work 
these days el teleprompte in dc decides that he wants to sign a nuclear treaty with iran mandate transgender bathrooms legalize millions of illegal aliens or open relations with his brother tyrant in havana and he does so on his own authority and congress is dismissed as a bunch of obstructionists 
thats not how america is supposed to work thats how iran works thats how cuba works 
the first word in the introduction to obamas presidential policy directive on cuba after the date was i obamas basis for his authority is his  announcement letat cest moi obama is the state 
jfk no humble shrinking violet mentions i only in the fourth paragraph after congress what is the context of kennedys i now therefore i john f kennedy president of the united states of america acting under the authority of section a of the foreign assistance act of  
the i of jfk can only act as a servant not a master 
in obamas directive congress exists only to be berated or badgered for its obstructionism there is no source of authorization for anything other than barack obama there is no law only obama 
now the big we in washington have decided that they will oppose america at the united nations but ben rhodes who aspires to excel at novelistic narratives made an unfortunate slip obama has been accused of louis xivs letat cest moi mentality but ben rhodes isnt saying we are the state instead he tells us that there are two powerful political entities in america one is us the other is we 
we does not yet entirely control the state but we also feels no obligation to the united states if we agrees with america then we will vote with it at the un if we opposes america then we votes against it we will choose patriotism or treason based on its own interests not ours 
we happens to run america but it isnt america its the parasite humped on americas back 
you can call we by many names deep state is one its a coalition of leftwing special interests networking through politics the nonprofit sector and media corporations to control america 
president kennedy was quite familiar with the enemy  we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influenceon infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of elections on intimidation instead of free choice 
kennedy was speaking after the recent bay of pigs crisis the foreign assistance act mentioned by him was passed by congress that year while the cuban embargo limited the ability of the castro regime to sponsor and spread terror around the region and the world it didnt stop the we in washington dc 
it is easy to sit here in the distant future of  and wonder whether cuba matters at all but the truth is that we are still enmeshed in the same fundamental struggle of the cold war that struggle did not end when the berlin wall fell it is a battle over whether nations will be ruled by we the people or by the nameless we of the monolithic and ruthless conspiracy of the nomenklatura of the left 
by backing away from america at the united nations the we have announced their independence from the laws responsibilities and duties of the country whose government they have hijacked 
but the we offer us no such independence from their treasonous rule instead they impose on us the collectivism of yevgeny zamyatins novel we in which everyone suffers under the stifling progressive tyranny of the one state that controls every aspect of human life that novel inspired  
what we offer us is what cubas castro wes one state and every communist regime offer us its what george orwell in  summed up as a boot stamping on a human face  forever 
president kennedy dated his embargo proclamation from the one hundred and eightysixth year of the independence of the united states of america at the united nations ambassador power cheerfully declared americas enforced submission to the communist demands for cuba 
the cuban people show no signs of winning independence from their communist overlords the question is will the united states of america be able to regain its independence from the we",2016-11-01
233,democratic panic,"dawn perlmutter 
the war on law enforcement is epidemic every aspect of culture has been infected the antipolice disease is highly contagious and rapidly spreading on social media in memes in movements in popular fast food restaurants at football games on campuses in media and in every aspect of american culture 
an epidemic is defined as the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time colin kaepernick is the typhoid mary of the antipolice epidemic kaepernick refuses to stand while the us national anthem is being performed at the start of nfl games as a protest against alleged racial injustice and police brutality on sept  kaepernick chose to kneel on one knee as his protest gesture instead of just sitting on the bench his explanation for his decision to switch is that it was an attempt to show more respect to former and current us military members as if kneeling is somehow symbolically less offensive than sitting he misinterpreted the meaning of the military expression take a knee which occurs when troops take a pause before continuing their mission similar to hands up dont shoot the antipolice gesture has been imbued with a trendy righteousness regardless of its original meaning the media reverently refers to kaepernicks protest as taking a knee as if it is some kind of sacred act there are no headlines that read kaepernick disses the flag or kaepernick takes a crap on his country just in case his gesture didnt send a clear enough message kaepernick also uses clothing to symbolize his antipolice sympathies he has worn everything from tshirts honoring the militant black panther party to socks that depict police as pigs in addition to numerous other crimes the black panther party was responsible for the murder of at least  officers and originated the expression off the pigs meaning murder police 
like the typhoid infected cook mary mallon kaepernick is rapidly spreading the antipolice pathogen in what has been dubbed the kaepernick effect dozens of nfl and wnba players have knelt sat or raised a fist during the national anthem the disease has also spread to over  high schools  colleges and one middle school in what can only be described as a bizarre symbolic contradiction there were two incidents where women performing the star spangled banner got down on one knee in protest of what they were singing one of the women denasia lawrence not only kneeled while performing the anthem but also opened her jacket to display a black lives matter tshirt exposing miami heat fans to the contagious disorder 
rapid spread is well known for infectious diseases the antipolice disorder also contaminated the navy an unidentified sailor assigned to the naval air technical training center in pensacola florida filmed herself deliberately not standing for the national anthem and posted it on facebook she remained seated and raised a fist during morning colors and then praised colin kaepernick another sailor petty officer nd class janaye ervin an intelligence specialist in the navy reserve stationed at pearl harbor did not stand for the national anthem while in uniform she also posted a statement on facebook saying she was inspired by colin kaepernick the navy acted decisively she lost her security clearance and may be facing jail in response to her actions it is yet to be known if facing real consequences will contribute to curing the virus or accelerating it 
kaepernick is just one carrier of the antipolice disease the source of the infection can be attributed to specific movements such as black lives matter that originated in florida during the trayvon martin protests the disease went airborne in ferguson missouri where it was transmitted to college students professional protesters and journalists who subsequently spread the disorder to towns and cities across the country currently the disease seems to cluster around populations that are susceptible to antipolice propaganda the symptoms are irrationality excessive anger impaired perception anxiety hatred and delusions of oppression acute symptoms include sudden changes in behavior aggression paranoia loss of control and homicidal and suicidal tendencies all indicators are expressed in severe disrespect for law and order 
early symptoms of the antipolice epidemic have been observed in various cultural manifestations of contempt for law enforcement officers antipolice graffiti is a common symptom of the virus writing has escalated from insults such as police are murderers to threats of violence a recent popular indicator is the expression kill cops and related variations such as kill all police save a life kill a cop cops lives dont matter and shoot cops threats are also depicted in images such as guns to officers heads violent antipolice rhetoric has also been seen in protest signs that read all my heroes kill cops put wings on pigs kill cops and cops under control or cops under flowers disturbingly antipolice graffiti protests and tweets increase after officers are murdered signifying that violence against cops is celebrated and glorified 
the antipolice epidemic has also spread to wellknown fast food restaurants employees have refused to serve officers at a taco bell in phenix city al dunkin donuts in west hartford ct krispy kreme in columbia sc ihop in virginia beach va arbys in pembroke pines fl chuck e cheese in bowling green ky whataburger in lewisville tx mcdonalds in brenham tx chipotle in brooklyn ny genghis grill in dallas tx noodles  company in alexandria va tropical smoothie in winter haven fl luckys teriyaki sedrowoolley wa and at the krystal restaurant in irondale al other incidents involved employees refusing to let an officer use the restroom in a philadelphia starbucks refusing service at a sunoco gas station in miramar fl writing black lives matter on an officers coffee cup at a dunkin donuts in providence ri and a walmart bakery in mcdonough ga refusing to bake a cake for a police officers retirement party these are just the incidents that have been made public 
refusing service at a restaurant goes beyond gestures of disrespect law enforcement officers are concerned that instead of simply being denied service that their food will be tampered with for this reason many officers will only eat at restaurants where they can see the food being made this is a legitimate concern on aug   in louisville ky five police officers were denied service at a taco bell when another employee took their orders they overheard a conversation between two employees making the food saying im going to mess with them which resulted in them walking out of the restaurant when officers have to fear what is being put in their food there can be no doubt that the war on police is a fullscale epidemic 
the antipolice infection went viral on social media facebook twitter instagram and other social networks have hundreds of antipolice pages ridiculing disrespecting and threatening officers protests and riots are organized on social media and some users openly advocate and celebrate the killing of police officers the following are examples of popular hashtags ftp fuck the police bluelivesmurder acab all cops are bastards bluelivesdontmatter fuckcops fuckthemall apdk all police dept killer fryemlikebacon blacklivesmatter ferguson milwaukeeuprising and kaepernick 
as the disease progresses more acute symptoms begin to manifest in acts of violence a particularly offensive indicator of the disorder is the desecration of fallen officer memorials memorials honoring officers killed in the line of duty have been attacked in philadelphia chicago albuquerque fresno denver new orleans oakland austin honolulu rochester san diego st paul covington richmond goshen fayetteville raleigh and many other cities across the country vandalism has involved everything from dousing in paint toppling and scratching granite burning to destroying a metal torch in order to extinguish the eternal flame in a previous article  i described these acts as symbolic assassinations vandals target tributes to heroic officers because they want to appropriate the valor honor and respect that they think they have been deprived of this is another symptom of the antipolice disease a sense of entitlement and resentment that leads to both symbolic and actual attacks on law enforcement officers 
at its most critical stage the antipolice disorder is lethal this is expressed in the dozens of ambushes and killings of police officers in the most acute phase of the disease some of those infected become homicidal and suicidal targeting and killing officers knowing that they will die in the incident a pattern has emerged that clearly demonstrates that attacks on police escalate from protest gestures to acts of vandalism to deadly shootings that inspire further demonstrations in a continual cycle of protest and violence consequently kaepernicks gesture is neither benign nor harmless it is one symptom in a deadly epidemic",2016-11-01
234,how trump happened,"force and fanaticism  wahhabism in saudi arabia and beyond is wahhabism a complete distortion of islam november   raymond ibrahim 
note in what follows shillman fellow raymond ibrahim reviews force and fanaticism wahhabism in saudi arabia and beyond by simon ross valentine a shorter version of the book review first appeared in the middle east quarterly fall  vol  no  
valentine a british methodist pastor and teacher who taught in saudi arabia has written a useful book about the desert kingdom most interesting is its exploration of how the monarchy is the single greatest force in spreading islamic fundamentalism it has spent as much as  billion to spread wahhabism in the west yet america and britain have been and are continuing to be implicit supporters of wahhabism 
valentine discusses the background of how this unholy alliance came about he warns if the west simply ignores it saudi arabias role in international terrorism seems likely to worsen rather than conveniently disappear this is troubling considering that isis is saudi arabias latest monstrous contribution to world history 
the author explores important topics including the mutawwa  or religious police and provides useful historical context discussing the origins of wahhabism its alliance with the house of saud and the oil discoveries that changed everything 
the books primary defect is standard valentine regularly insists that it is of the greatest importance to distinguish between wahhabism and islam generally anything good positive tolerant and peaceful is ascribed to islam anything bad negative intolerant and violentmisogyny draconian punishments execution of apostates intolerance for and discrimination against nonmuslimsis ascribed to wahhabism 
this position appears to be based on the authors own cultural presuppositions thus he felt confused and puzzled to hear of wahhabi intolerance including the attempt to propagate their beliefs by force prompting him to wonder can you force someone to love god in all the conversations i had with ulema imams mutawa religious police and saudis generally there was never a mention of love the idea that god loved me just frightful talk of hell burning and future pain if i did not believe and accept the wahhabi faith 
had valentine engaged in a critical reading of islamic doctrine and historyas opposed to projecting his christian notion of god onto islamhe wouldve known that muhammad followed by countless caliphs and sultans throughout the centuries did propagate their beliefs by force the overwhelming majority of todays muslim world was taken from nonmuslims by force and that although islam attributes  characteristics to god love is not one of them 
valentines readers wouldve benefit much more had he simply laid out his useful information concerning the inner workings of the saudi regime and its unholy alliance with the west without trying to tackle the deeper question of what islam really isleading to yet another book marred by islamic apologetics",2016-11-01
235,obama wont vote with america at the un,"if government can truly alleviate poverty why have leftist policies only made it worse november   thomas sowell 
the political left keeps announcing as if it is a new breakthrough discovery of theirs that life is unfair 
have they never read thomas grays elegy written in a country churchyard more than two and a half centuries ago what about economic historian david s landes statement the world has never been a level playing field 
in the joint autobiography of milton friedman and his wife rose they say everywhere in the world there are gross inequities of income and wealth they offend most of us few can fail to be moved by the contrast between the luxury enjoyed by some and the grinding poverty suffered by others 
moreover professor friedman left behind a foundation dedicated to promoting school choice so that disadvantaged children could get a better education for a better chance in life 
what is it that the political left is saying that they think is so new such a breakthrough and such a necessity for progress more important what test of evidence  if any  have they ever subjected their notions to 
no one has presented the social vision of the left more often than nicholas kristof of the new york times  and no one has been more certain that those who do not happen to share his vision just dont get it as he has repeatedly declared 
mr kristofs essay growing up poor in america in the october th new york times is a classic example of the mindset of the left 
it begins with the story of a poor black teenager in arkansas being raised by a single mom sometimes he goes hungry and his home does not have even one book but it does have television sets with huge screens and apparently there is money enough to buy marijuana 
surely we can all agree that this young fellow has very unpromising future prospects ahead of him and that this is a human tragedy the circumstances of his life are unfair to him and none of us would want to be born into such circumstances moreover he is just one of many who are brought up in a setting that is full of dangers and with a low probability of improvement 
but that is not enough for mr kristof or for the political left in general of such youngsters he says as a society we fail them long before they fail us 
whoa just when did society make the decisions and engage in the actions that have led to this teenager being in the bad situation he is in and just when did society acquire either the omniscience or the omnipotence to prevent it 
when the left says society they usually mean government that is apparently what society means in this case for kristof laments that this teenager is the kind of person whom americas presidential candidates just dont talk about 
if the left chooses to believe that government intervention is the answer to such tragedies that is their right but if they expect the rest of us to share that belief surely they could subject that belief to some empirical test but we can however 
the s were the triumphant decade of those who wanted government intervention to solve what they called social problems how did that work out what were things like before this social vision triumphed and what were things like afterwards 
homicide victimization rates among black males were going down substantially in the s and the s but homicide victimization rates reversed and skyrocketed in the s wiping out all the progress of the two previous decades 
when the s began most black children were born into families with both a mother and a father after the great welfare state expansion during the s most black children were born to a single mother like the youngster in arkansas today 
kristofs essay also mentions a teenage girl who is a single mother and suggests that sex education could have prevented her from getting pregnant teenage pregnancy was going down  repeat down  during the s it reversed and shot up after the s began bringing the sex education vision into schools across the country 
very similar trends occurred in england after very similar visions and policies also triumphed there in the s perhaps it is the left that just doesnt get it  or cannot face the hard fact that its own vision and policies worsened the very things they claimed would be made better",2016-11-01
236,the antipolice epidemic,"time investigating hillary is an attack on all women november   
good morning its tuesday 
whos up for another silly attempt to claim that hillary clinton is only being investigated for her rogue email setup because shes a woman this gem comes from robin lakoff a berkeley professor in sustained incoherence and special pleading 
hillary clintons emailgate is an attack on women 
its not about emails its about public communication by a woman 
i am mad i am mad because i am scared and if you are a woman you should be too emailgate is a bitch hunt but the target is not hillary clinton its us 
the only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female can you imagine this happening to a man 
his name was general petraeus thank you have a nice day 
clinton is guilty of swf speaking while female and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what shes doing and must be punished for the sake of all decent women everywhere there is so much of that going around 
that escalated quickly and incoherently also im pretty sure its not the s or whatever decade robin is parodying or channeling but yes hillary clinton is only in this mess because shes a woman it has nothing to do with anything else that must be why albright and rice werent in the center of similar scandals 
if the candidate were male there would be no scolding and no scandal those very ideas would be absurd men have a nearly absolute right to freedom of speech in theory so do women but that as the creationists like to say is only a theory 
emailing classified information on your server to avoid transparency regulations is not free speech its illegal for both public officials of both genders 
but heres hillary rodham clinton the very public standin for all bossy uppity and ambitious women here are her emails and since its a woman doing what decent women should never doengaging in highlevel public communicationwell there must be something wrong with that even if we cant quite find that something

hillarys people have gone on the warpath against the fbi their allies are obamas political appointees at the doj and this is who is in their corner 
the justice department official in charge of informing congress about the newly reactivated hillary clinton email probe is a political appointee and former privatepractice lawyer who kept clinton campaign chairman john podesta out of jail lobbied for a tax cheat later pardoned by president bill clinton and led the effort to confirm attorney general loretta lynch 
peter kadzik who was confirmed as assistant attorney general for legislative affairs in june  represented podesta in  when independent counsel kenneth starr was investigating podesta for his possible role in helping exbill clinton intern and mistress monica lewinsky land a job at the united nations 
fantastic lawyer kept me out of jail podesta wrote on sept   to obama aide cassandra butts according to emails hacked from podestas gmail account and posted by wikileaks 
kadziks name has surfaced multiple times in regard to the fbis investigation of democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton for using a private homebrewed server after fbi director james comey informed congress on thursday the fbi was reviving its inquiry when new evidence linked to a separate investigation was discovered congressional leaders wrote to the department of justice seeking more information kadzik replied 
we assure you that the department will continue to work closely with the fbi and together dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible kadzik wrote on oct  
kadzik had been an attorney with dickstein shapiro llp for  years before he represented podesta in the clintonlewinsky investigation he was hired in  as a lobbyist for tax cheat marc rich who was controversially granted a pardon by president bill clinton during clintons final days in office kadzik got the job because he was trusted by white house chief of staff john podesta and was considered to be a useful person to convey marc richs arguments to mr podesta according to a  house oversight committee report

the fbi has an early present for hillary clinton its the files from the time her husband decided to pardon a wanted fugitive in exchange for cash that fugitive was a fellow by the name of marc rich his prosecutor james comey 
the fbi unexpectedly released  pages of documents related to an investigation closed without charges in  into president bill clintons pardon of marc rich who had been married to a wealthy democratic donor 
the unusual timing of the release was the result of a freedom of information act request that had been completed and was posted under standard fbi practice according to a law enforcement official who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters but the clinton campaign immediately questioned the timing of the release 
well of course it did its never especially wise to pick fights with people who have a lot of dirt on you 
the investigation stemmed from one of several pardons clinton made on the last day of his presidency in  that of financier and international fugitive marc rich whose exwife denise had given to the democratic national committee and the entity that would later become the clinton foundation 
and theres a surprise guest 
while the files may seem dated they invoke figures beyond the clintons who went on to play key roles in official washington  including comey

the aerial detonations would last for two minutes with the triumphal celebration permitted to start as early as  pm  a mere halfhour after the polls close in new york sources said

daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
like a warped islamic version of santa claus obama had a secret muslim list and his people checked it at least twice the list was of muslims who were prospects for important jobs and appointments 
it included a muslim who had described israel as an apartheid state irans goto guy in new york financial circles and a number of figures linked to the muslim brotherhood 
it was the ultimate religious test from an administration that had vocally rejected them 
obama had claimed that having religious tests for migration was shameful and not american 
when i hear folks say that well maybe we should just admit the christians but not the muslims he huffed from turkey his muslim host country was run by a bigoted sponsor of islamic terror 
we dont have religious tests he insisted 
except we did and we do obama also had religious tests his religious tests excluded christians and favored muslims that is why his syrian refugees were between  and  muslim with only  christians and  yazidis even though both groups are real victims of the muslim religious war 
syria is  christian and hundreds of thousands have been displaced yet only  have made it past obamas iron curtain thats either an islamic religious test or the worlds greatest coincidence 
but would the man who piously lectured us on the evils of religious tests really have a religious test 
of course he would 
the hacked emails include a list of muslim american candidates for top administration jobs subcabinet jobs and outside boardsagenciespolicy committees 
the list was sent to john podesta who headed the obamabiden transition project it had been put together by a woman who had sat on the commission on international religious freedom but boasted that she had excluded those with some arab american background but who are not muslim eg george mitchell many lebanese americans for example are christian 
how shameful how not american of barack hussein obama 
most who are listed appear to be muslimamerican except that a handful where noted may be arab american but of uncertain religion esp christian she assured podesta 
religious tests are only out of line when they exclude muslims not when they exclude christians 
thats the pattern which emerged from the obamabiden transition project and obamas refugee policy there has been a clear pattern of administration bias against christians and jews and in favor of muslims that bias has been obvious in a foreign policy which backed islamic supremacist groups such as the muslim brotherhood over more moderate governments at the expense of nonmuslim populations 
this policy led to the displacement and death of countless christians and the persecution of entire communities by an administration which then denied safe harbor to the victims of its own policies 
administration bias replicated that same bigoted policy at home when it favored islamic candidates 
obama appointed farooq kathwari the first name on the muslim list sent to podesta to the presidents advisory commission on asian americans and pacific islanders 
the muslim list email had warned that kathwaris then yearold americaneducated son irfan aka imran was killed in  fighting jihad against the russians in afghanistan the actions of his son who may have been with the mujahedeen but was also apparently outraged over indias defense of kashmir is of less relevance than kathwaris appearance at an isna conference and another conference cosponsored by the muslim students association both groups are linked to the muslim brotherhood 
he cochaired the american muslim task force whose members included salam almarayati  director of the muslim public affairs council which has defended hamas and hezbollah yahya basha president of the american muslim council and a former board member of the muslim public affairs council and assorted other islamists  its report complained that muslims were inhibited from donating to charities run by islamic terrorist groups such as hezbollah yahya basha also appeared on obamas muslim list 
also listed was mpacs aslam abdullah who had claimed that zionists christians and hindus were behind the war on terror he had described israel as an apartheid state and a racist state 
the second muslim on the list cyrus amirmokri was named assistant treasury secretary he became the first iranian to be named to such a high position and defended the iran nuclear sellout mokri attended a meeting with members of the iran lobby at the white house he also reportedly advised obama on iranian sanctions 
obama had famously told nasa boss bolden that one of his three tasks at the space agency was muslim selfesteem but bolden almost didnt make it in the muslim list included two alternative candidates for nasa administrator one of them dr charles elachi of jpl was dismissed as possibly christian indeed elachi who grew up admiring john wayne and believes that american success is possible because it isnt held back by the longstanding ingrained systems and beliefs found in the middle east would have been a rather poor fit but it is deeply shameful and unamerican that his potential nasa appointment questioned his religion that is an inappropriate religious test that obama must apologize for 
the other name on the list however is firouz naderi an iranian board member of the public affairs alliance of iranian americans which advocated in support of the iran nuke sellout 
eboo patel whose name would frequently appear on lists of islamists in the obama administration first made an appearance on the muslim list despite his islamist ties he got the posting at the advisory council on faithbased neighborhood partnerships also listed were keith ellison andre carson and larry shaw shaw sits on the board of cair 
dilawar syed the first name to appear on the list of possible appointments was named to obamas advisory commission on asian americans and pacific islanders syed is a cofounder and chair of the asian americans and pacific islander victory fund which has come out for hillary clinton the secret muslim list describes him as animated by policy issues relating to the muslim world a similar description is appended to the bio for kashif zafar who served as a cochair of the south asian american leadership council at the dnc 
also on the list was hamid biglari bloomberg described biglari as irans man in new york and as the iranian presidents goto guy in new york financial circles biglari was a key iran lobby figure 
the recently revealed secret muslim list is deeply troubling there should be no religious test for political appointments yet obama had one and his people sought to screen out christians and favor muslims 
this represents behavior that is in obamas own words shameful and not american one cant help but conclude that based on his own principles obama is shameful and not american",2016-11-01
243,fbi releases files on bill clintons cash for pardons scandal,"will james comey change the outcome of the election is this the gamechanging october surprise that many hope for  and others dread november   
bruce thornton is a shillman journalism fellow at the david horowitz freedom center 
fbi director james comeys reopening of the investigation into clintons emails has roiled once more the presidential election donald trump has called the decision courageous and bigger than watergate clinton the doj democrat senators and their media flying monkeys are all having conniption fits over their quondam champions defection calling the announcement appalling absurd strange deeply troubling an attack and unprecedented the bigger question is whether it will move enough voters over to trumps side and put him in the white house 
theres no doubt that comeys announcement eleven days before the election is mystifying not because it is unprecedented as the democrats keep squealing they had no such qualms when the weekend before the  election special prosecutor lawrence walsh indicted a pollsurging george hw bush for his alleged involvement in the irancontra scandal no the mystery is comeys motives is comey like conrads lord jim now sacrificing his fbi careersure to be over if the notoriously vengeful clinton is elected to atone for having besmirched his office reputation and the principle of equality before the law in service to careerist selfinterest or was he facing a mutiny and leaks from disgruntled fbi investigators to quote one of our candidates at this point what difference does it make 
the real question is whether it will make a difference to the voters right now we dont know if the content of the  emails from the conjugal laptop used by serial sexter anthony weiner estranged husband of clinton vizier huma abedin will reveal something damning like say classified materials but we already know that clinton passed classified information over an unsecured server which didnt bother comey back in july so what could be in these new emails that rises above comeys sophistic extreme carelessness and reaches the statutes gross negligence or has comey found new evidence of hillarys intent his other exculpatory sophistry that had little to do with the law there had to be something that made comey subject himself to the scorchedearth wrath of the democrats 
whatever is found on the abedin laptop one wonders if will even matter to a sufficient number of voters they have shrugged off so many scandals lies and failures that should have sunk a candidacy that its hard to calculate what level of incompetence unpleasantness dishonesty sleaze and crime is disqualifying anymore here are the greatest hits from hillarys catalogue whitewater missing billing records from her tenure at the rose law firm renting out the lincoln bedroom to donors travelgate illegal possession of fbi files conducting illegal secret meetings of the task force on national health care reform cackling over keeping a pedophile rapist out of jail hounding the victims of her husbands sexual assaults and philandering stealing  worth of china furniture and artwork from the white house claiming she landed under sniper fire in bosnia claiming she and bill left the white house dead broke shaking down wall street while assuring the orcs of capitalism that shes got their back charging exorbitant speaking fees for a half hour of banalities and bromides calling  missing emails personal communications lying about the benghazi attack to the faces of the four dead americans families supporting the lie that the attacks were caused by an obscure internet video when she knew the same night that they werent perjuring herself before congress and the fbi about the emails and her private server the disastrous overthrow of ghaddafi in libya the disastrous reset with russia the disastrous nuclear deal with iran the disastrous withdrawal from iraq the corrupt clinton foundation and its wholly owned subsidiary the paytoplay state department using feminist rhetoric while taking cash from some of the planets most brutally misogynistic regimes serially flipflopping on issues like samesex marriage the trans pacific trade deal and the keystone pipeline promising to raise taxes on the middle class and put coal miners out of work her campaign staffs dirty tricks against trump and his supporters her campaign staffs incestuous relationship with the media her staffs illegal destruction of incriminating evidence during the email investigation her strong support of gruesome lateterm abortions and last but not least the continuing unanswered questions about her physical and cognitive health 
back in the day just a few of these gaffes deceptions and failures would probably have sunk a campaign for congress let alone the white house 
and mr trumps offenses hes talks exactly as youd expect a new york real estate developer casino owner reality television star and beauty pageant mogul to talk hes condemned as a sexual assaulter for saying a decade ago what bill clinton and every whitehousevisiting rapper movie star or rock star knows about the sexual perks of celebrity when youre a star they let you do it as trump bragged of his crude sexual advances hes ignorant of policy he doesnt understand the economics of global trade he doesnt know what the nuclear triad is hes addicted to a half dozen superlative adjectives he wants to build a wall with mexico he takes legal advantage of tax law hes not suitable for office he does not have the right temperament hes used bankruptcy as a business tool hes accused of groping over a dozen women including a polymorphously perverse porn star hes mean and insulting he has orange hair 
in short trump lacks the superficial patina of rhetorical decorum and sober demeanor that most modern presidents and candidates spray over their public personas in order to hide their private flaws and vices just ask hillarys various secret service details how wide the distance between public and private personalities can be 
the voters will decide for themselves which candidates catalogue of sins is more disqualifying and dangerous but whatever happens its clear that we the people have lowered the bar of acceptability for presidential candidates 
this transformation happened decades before trump and hillary came along after bill clinton was impeached for perjury related to his sordid sexual depredations in the white house his approval ratings were  he left the white house with a  rating higher than any president since harry truman including ronald reagan think about it the president who sexually exploited an intern and was impeached for perjury left office with higher approval ratings than the president who rescued the economy and tossed the soviet union into its own dustbin of history 
that was the inflection point for our political culture no wonder that barack obamas lack of any realworld experience or achievement leftwing views selfconfessed drug use friends like the antiamerican racist jeremiah wright and unrepentant terrorist bill ayers and gaping holes in his biography were unimportant to  million voters so why now are we shocked shocked that offbrand candidates like hillary clinton and donald trump are vying for the presidency decrying these candidates is closing the barn door after the horses of virtue wisdom and decorum have already long gone 
so absent a smoking howitzer in the next wikileaks dump comeys restart of the investigation which in any case will take months to complete will probably not be the gamechanging october surprise many hope for and others dread especially given a corrupt medias studied indifference to anything that damages their candidate then again the rapid erosion of hillarys support is drawing analogies to reagans late surge against carter 
either way on november  most people will vote their economic interests and their ideological passions and decide based on subjective perceptions and silly criteria like cares for people like me or they might just finally realize that hillarys accumulated offenses are intolerable but what that standard of selection will deliver is anybodys guess",2016-11-01
244,hillary already planning fireworks for victory celebration,"lloyd billingsley 
presidential debates between donald trump and hillary clinton included a third participant vladimir putin standing in the background stealthily inserting himself in the process putins russia uses deniable cyberhooliganism to actively prank the american political system and its taking a toll   this is the putin playbook steal cheat attack disrupt mislead confuse if caught lie and deny and it gets worse 
unfortunately the republican presidential nominee reinforces this narrative referring to a rigged system and an indictable opponent his outbursts follow years of domestic political discord where comity is history crazy seems the new normal and a sitting president can be heckled with you lie 
all told the piece reads like a clinton press release but its actually putins powerful playbook hack steal disrupt mislead confuse in the october  sacramento bee  two days after the comey email bombshell the author is markos kounalakis billed as a senior fellow at central european university and visiting fellow at the hoover institution that doesnt quite capture the man and his connections with the clintons which have shown up in wikileaks 
mr kounalakis author line fails to reveal that he is married to eleni tsakopouloskounalakis daughter of realestate tycoon angelo tsakopoulos according to greek usa reporter  angelo is a top political donor to the clintons as well as the democratic party whose donations to former president bill clinton were rewarded with a night in the prestigious lincoln bedroom in  tsakopoulos confirmed that hillary clinton will seek the democratic nomination in the next presidential election 
angelos daughter eleni a protégé of nancy pelosi and barbara boxer  raised more than  million for hillary clinton in   and that money found its reward on january   us secretary of state hillary clinton swore in tsakopouloskounalakis as us ambassador to hungary in that capacity  she condemned wikileaks for releasing secret diplomatic cables but declined comment on the authenticity of the material tsakopouloskounalakis served as ambassador until  but as wikileaks confirms she continued as a key clinton supporter doing her best to beat back a presidential run by joe biden 
in a june   email eleni tsakopoulos kounalakis tells john podesta that a bay area bagman swears biden is running he said he took him on air force two and hes getting emails last july tsakopouloskounalakis emailed clinton confidant jake sullivan that hrc indicated her view that it would be best to avoid grexit and a july   email to sullivan john podesta and huma abedin she supports terms that will allow greece to stay in the eurozone 
on october   tsakopoulos kounalakis emailed podesta that there is a greek american love fest going on with joe biden very boyclub the same day she emailed podesta and huma abedin that we had a david brock dinner with annie karni from politico she asked to use four quotes from me see attached i told her the first two could be with attribution and the second two without 
as the emails to john podesta and humba abedin reveal ambassador eleni kounalakis as she styles herself remains part of hillary clintons inner circle tellingly the mcclatchytribune newspapers that run her husbands columns do not acknowledge the strong clinton connection 
the new york times proclaimed kounalakis a white knight for rescuing washington monthly  where he served as publisher and teamed with editor paul glastris this tandem made the publication a progressive mustread according to clinton strategist james carville kounalakis reported for newsweek in east germany and ran their bureau in prague he also worked in moscow for nbc radio and mutual news 
kounalakis books include hope is a tattered flag voices for the postbush era  with peter laufer and beyond spin the power of strategic corporate journalism with drew banks and kim daus it remains something of a mystery how the leftist kounalakis became a visiting fellow at the hoover institution known for strong conservative writers and scholars such as thomas sowell victor davis hanson and bruce thornton 
only one time as this writer recalls has kounalakis acknowledged in print his wifes strong clinton connections even after the wikileaks revelations and with a presidential election only days away kounalakis did not acknowledge his wifes key role in hrcs inner circle with john podesta and huma abedin his october  sacramento bee piece suggests markos is right at home in those circles 
kounalakis attacks the republican presidential nominee implying that he is crazy and a tool of the evil putin on the other hand the clinton email scandal gets zero attention and the author piles on the ad copy american society has made great strides in lgbtq rights womens rights and minority rights and has a relatively strong and resilient globally innovative economy 
the author gives readers good cause to regard this article as pure clinton campaign propaganda from a camouflaged clinton crony maybe markos will join his wife huma abedin and john podesta in the wikileaks revelations for many observers the issue is not where the leaks came from but whether the revelations are true and authentic if markos kounalakis believes they are bogus maybe he can write about whats in the real ones",2016-11-01
245,obamas secret muslim list,"search form search from bad to worse  obamas ransom payment to iran is just the tip of the iceberg in his bid to pursue a legacy obama charts disastrous course with reckless abandon november   ari lieberman 
most of us including several democratic lawmakers cringed when obama inked the iran deal but those of us who are familiar with the malevolent nature of the iranian regime recoiled in horror when we learned that obama transferred  million to the iranians in exchange for four american citizens held captive by the mullahs on trumped up charges the  million was part of a larger installment totaling  billion ostensibly to settle claims iran had against the united states stemming from aborted iranian arms purchases dating back to the shah obama claimed that this was money that was owed to iran and the settlement which included  billion in interest saved the us taxpayer billions because the iranians were demanding even more at the hague tribunal where the claim was being adjudicated 
the timing and method of the cash transfers were disquieting to say the least and raised serious questions of legality as well as broader geopolitical concerns the americans were freed only after iran received its  million the payment which was airlifted in the dead of night in an unmarked cargo plane was made in untraceable cash stacked on wooden pallets the iranians demanded swiss francs and euros rather than dollars and a pliant obama agreed to the islamic republics dictates gleeful iranian leaders were quick to announce victory and claimed that the payment was indeed a ransom contradicting the administrations adamant denials 
even within the administration there was confusion about whether the payment was in fact a ransom state department spokesman mark toner came very close to acknowledging this fact when he noted that the  million was used as leverage to ensure the americans safe return the white house however quickly repudiated the state departments characterization 
even if one were to believe the story peddled by the administration the mere appearance of a quid pro quo payment potentially exposes the us to extortion and hostagetaking the iranians certainly believed it was a ransom payment and more likely than not every twobit dictator on the planet saw it that way as well 
but there are deeper more troubling aspects to this convoluted story in his january   address to the american people obama tried to put a positive spin on his dealings with the islamic republic but as noted by rick richman in an excellent article featured in mosaic  the deal struck with the iranians was rotten to its core and the administration deliberately kept the american people in the dark about various aspects of the shady arrangement 
the  million that the us transferred to iran came from irans foreign military sales fms account with the pentagon the balance of  billion ostensibly represented interest accrued since  but obama neglected to note that when iran filed its lawsuit the us filed counterclaim against iran for  million for iranian breaches of its obligations under the fms program the us could have conceivably won that counterclaim which would have meant wooden pallets of cash for the american treasury courtesy of the islamic republic 
moreover american plaintiffs maintained sixteen us court judgments against the islamic republic stemming from that regimes involvement in terrorist activities those judgments totaled  billion in compensatory and punitive damages 
some plaintiffs sought to recover their judgments directly from irans fms account but their efforts were stymied by the clinton administration instead under a convoluted deal struck between congress and the clinton administration in  the us treasury was to pay the holders of the judgments against iran for the amount of their compensatory damages and  percent of their punitive damages up to the amount in the fms fund the judgments would then be subrogated to the united states which meant that judgments became direct us claims against the iranian government 
iran ignored the judgments and never paid any of the plaintiffs under us law the  million sitting in the fms account should have gone back to the us treasury which had already paid the judgment holders but the us treasury never collected a dime on the subrogated claims since obama shipped the money off on wooden pallets to iran essentially the us taxpayer ended up footing the bill for irans terrorism while the iranians were never held accountable for their maleficence 
obamas actions represented blatant disregard for the law for the victims of terrorism and for the american taxpayer his claim of saving the taxpayer billions represents the zenith of mendacity 
obama claimed that the payments had to be made in cash because existing sanctions prohibited normal banking procedures but as noted by richman the sanctions regimen expressly permits payments made to settle iranian claims instituted at the hague exposing yet another lie by the obama administration 
there was one and only one reason why the iranians requested cash and all but the most disingenuous know what that reason is the iranians are the worlds foremost statesponsors of international terrorism they finance terrorist groups and proxy militias throughout the region and internationally but can only do so through illicit means that circumvent normal methods of financing hence they demanded untraceable cash the misery that we are currently witnessing in syria yemen and elsewhere is due in no small part to the obama administration which provided the iranians with the cash necessary to keep operations flowing 
in addition to the  billion in cash obama also authorized the release of seven convicted iranian felons and expunged warrants on  others but this aspect of the transaction seems almost trivial when considering the sheer mendacity and illegality of nearly every other aspect of the deal 
lastly the transfer of such a large sum to iran in settlement of an alleged legal claim required the attorney generals approval but the administration has yet to produce any document bearing loretta lynchs signature authorizing such payment on october  sen marco rubio r fla and rep mike pompeo r kan presented lynch with a series of questions seeking clarification of various aspects of the deal lynch whose tenure as attorney general is proving to be as corrupt and partisan as her predecessor has inexplicably refused to answer the lawmakers queries 
in a desperate attempt to establish a legacy obama pursued the iran deal with reckless abandon forfeiting positions previously regarded as red lines and signing the worst deal in us diplomatic history the ancillary deal struck with the iranians concerning american hostages was laced with outright lies and enabled the iranians to continue their reign or regional terror more importantly it may also have been in violation of existing us law and lynchs stonewalling only lends credence to that notion",2016-11-02
246,will james comey change the outcome of the election,"netanyahus critical foreign tour israels strategic repositioning 
originally published by the jerusalem post  
prime minister benjamin netanyahus upcoming trips to australia singapore kazakhstan and azerbaijan might be the most significant diplomatic visits he makes in his tenure in office the trips will take place against the backdrop of two major international shifts that cast israel into uncharted waters as a small state with a dizzying array of strategic threats arrayed against it the states that he will visit are all wellpositioned to help israel navigate its next moves the first shift is the uss political crackup 
next week american voters will choose their next president the major candidates democratic nominee hillary clinton and republican nominee donald trump are the weakest candidates to have ever stood for the highest office in the land their rise is a testament to the weakening if not the unraveling of the glue that has held america together since the civil war the unraveling of the us electorate comes against the backdrop of the diminution of us military power the uss multitrillion dollar investment in inconclusive if not failed wars in the middle east over the past  years has come at the expense of military modernization the f program has sucked up the majority of the remaining research and development funds and it has yet to produce a reliable airplane worse the fs long and problematic gestation period has given russia and china the time and opportunity to develop air defense systems capable of neutralizing the fs stealth systems those systems were supposed to be its chief advantage as the next generation fighter for the us and its allies the deterioration of the uss military capabilities has gone hand in hand with the uss apparent loss of strategic rationality this is apparent worldwide but is nowhere more obvious than in the middle east president barack obamas decision to effectively abandon the uss major allies in the middle east in favor of cultivating ties with iran has made the region far more dangerous to the us and its spurned allies than it was eight years ago true in theory obamas decision to prefer the shiites to the sunnis makes sense given the totalitarian and imperial nature of sunni jihadism but in light of the genocidal totalitarian and imperial nature of the current iranian regime his move made no sense and its impact has been massively destructive moreover obamas willingness to rack up the uss national debt in an unprecedented manner and repress economic growth through overregulation has left a large question mark over the possibility of a military buildup in other words even under the best circumstances it is hard to imagine that the us will be capable of reestablishing its global primacy over the next four years or even over the next decade the implications for israel are far reaching for decades israels strategic posture has been predicated on its ability to depend on us power this strategic posture is no longer tenable the second major international shift is russias sudden rise as the primary global power in the middle east as channel  reported sunday night russia has deployed sophisticated naval and air systems in the region that can detect all of israels air and naval operations in a matter of months israel has lost the air and naval supremacy it has enjoyed for the past four decades the air force reportedly is convinced that the fs stealth systems will be able to neutralize russias detection capabilities but given the welldocumented current problems with the fs stealth systems this conviction is unwise and even under the best circumstances in which israel has the opportunity to develop its own electronic warfare systems and apply them to its f without american interference it will take israel years to surmount the challenge that rapidly improving russian systems present to our air force according to channel s report air force and naval commanders are in a panic over the sudden turn of events rather than panicking though israel needs to roll with the punches and figure out how best to cope with this new situation the obvious answer is that we need to quickly expand our capabilities in areas that russias military primacy does not reach specifically israel needs to expand massively its capacity for undertheradar operations the first area that needs to be massively strengthened is our intelligence capabilities particularly human intelligence capabilities israel should be investing massively in developing and expanding our cultivation and direction of proxies on the ground throughout the region second israel needs to adapt its cyber technology capabilities in a manner that diminishes our enemies ability to strike us israel needs to be able to disrupt and disable command and control and other systems israels reach needs to extend as low down the line of its enemies military chain of command as possible if our offensive capabilities are being checked so must the capabilities of our enemies indeed our enemies need to be subverted part of the intelligence and cyber capabilities that israel must develop and deploy must be geared toward destabilizing with the goal of overthrowing the regime in iran at the same time israel should be empowering antiregime sectors in iran in a manner that expands the prospect of developing close ties with a successor regime along the lines of the strategic alliance israel built with the regime of the shah in the decades which preceded the  islamic revolution third israel needs to expand and diversify the capabilities of our ground forces israel needs to be capable of using new means to deploy its fighters at home and on distant shores it needs to align its both its special and regular forces with the new threat environment and it needs to be able to utilize its ground forces in manners that can extend the reach and diminish the compromised positions of its air and naval assets in the era of russian regional primacy fourth israel needs to expand its economic growth and diversify its economic ties in a manner that positions it as a regional economic power it needs to use it natural gas resources specifically as a means to expand and deepen its ties with asia such economic growth and power will positively influence russias willingness to allow israel to carry out air and naval operations against its enemies  and russias allies in lebanon syria and beyond in other words the more economically powerful israel is the more russia will be willing to side with israel against hezbollah and others that are currently operating under the russian umbrella this then brings us to netanyahus upcoming trips each state that he will visit has something to offer israel in expanding its intelligence cyberwarfare and economic capabilities australia a major western economy is moving toward china as america has become less engaged in the pacific israel has an acute interest in using australia as a platform for expanding its ties to china and other asian countries both because of the economic advantages such ties convey and due to chinas strategic importance to russia as for singapore israel effectively built the singaporean military in the s and s the country remains extremely supportive of israel like australia singapore has close ties to china it has technological and other capabilities that can be extremely advantageous for israel today azerbaijan and kazakhstan are critically important to israel today their strategic proximity to iran and their ties to russia along with their ethnic composition and their natural resources make securing good relations with both critical to israels ability to advance and security its strategic interests in every sphere israel has tremendous assets to offer each of the four countries that netanyahu will visit these assets must be deployed wisely to ensure that israel gains as much as possible from his trip and from its future ties with all of them given the dramatic changes in the global power balance and their implications for israel netanyahus decision to fly to visit these four countries just after the us elections tells us that he gets it at a time of regional and global turbulence and uncertainty in the context of swiftly multiplying threats this is no small matter",2016-11-02
247,hillarymediamolecon,"the hostility and hypocrisy of leftwing israeli ngos where are the condemnations of the pas efforts to prevent normalization with israel november   
originally written for the investigative project on terrorism 
israeli human rights group btselem recently appeared before a special session of the united nations security council excoriating israel and pleading with the body to act against israels settlements 
in  the un famously declared that zionism is racism and four decades later the organization continues to hound israel in each of the last four years as the syrian bloodbath claimed hundreds of thousands of lives there were at least five times as many resolutions condemning israel as those rebuking the rest of the world 
the uns cultural body unesco recently passed a motion ignoring any jewish or christian historical ties to east jerusalem holy sites referring to the temple mount and western wall only by their muslim names and condemning israel as the occupying power it turns out that some of israels leftwing ngos worked to help produce the unesco motion 
given the uns chronic hostility efforts by israeli ngos to persuade the un to act against israel are arguably treasonous indeed one attorney and activist for israels leftleaning labor party filed a police complaint alleging treason against btselem arguing that the ngo has harmed state sovereignty tried to give land away to a foreign entity and taken steps that could cause a war 
israeli democracy is extremely tolerant to the point of allowing its members of parliament to openly support terrorism and terrorist groups last march several israeli arab knesset members condemned arab states for labeling hizballah a terrorist organization even though it has been at war with israel for decades and regularly threatens new hostilities 
last february members from the joint arab list paid a solidarity visit to relatives of palestinian terrorists whom israeli security forces had killed to stop them from murdering israelis in  mk hanin zoabi balad drew praise from hamas after she asserted that the kidnappers of three missing israeli youths were not terrorists hamass connection to the young mens abduction and murder helped to spark the third war between israel and hamas in gaza 
thus israel already has plenty of dissenting voices and activists without foreign intervention nevertheless foreign interests have identified israeli ngos as the soft underbelly of israeli democracy and have leveraged them to promote their own agendas the problem became so acute that a watchdog ngo monitor was formed in  to track the selfhostility being funded largely by european and other foreign sources as the organization notes ngos lack a system of checks and balances andprovide accountability to their funders and activist members and not to the citizens or societies whose lives are directly impacted by their activities 
ngo monitor also notes that even though most of the foreign government funding for these israeli ngos is formally designated for educating the israeli public and changing public opinion both in violation of the norms on noninterference in other democracies these israeli ngos are very active externally in the delegitmization and political warfare against israel 
these leftwing israeli ngos receive money from about two dozen foreign governments  and some private organizations  that includes millions of dollars from billionaire george soros 
in catch the jew  author tuvia tenenbom exposed how foreignfunded human rights and cultural organizations in israel tend to serve as vehicles for attacking israel by presenting himself to interview subjects as tobi the german tenenbom elicits some surprising confessions for example the new fund for cinema and tv a foreignfunded israeli cultural ngo told him that that about  percent of political documentaries made in israel are coproduced by europeans that includes a documentary called what makes a hero which equates israels military with the nazis such films would be too scandalous to be produced in germany but germansponsored ngos can safely pay leftwing israelis to make such movies 
some foreign funders of israeli ngos have even unwittingly enriched hamas last august hamas allegedly siphoned off tens of millions of dollars from world vision a usbased charity and used the funds for weapons purchases tunnel construction and other military activities 
the knesset passed a law in july requiring disclosure of foreign funding sources for ngos that get more than half of their money from overseas the law is clearly aligned with the american foreign agents registration act fara wrote legal scholar eugene kontorovich who defended the legislation in response to critics 
israel is unique in the sheer scale of the foreign government sponsorship of domestic political groups he wrote for example the european union alone has in recent years given roughly  million euro a year for political ngos in the us and roughly an order of magnitude more in israela vastly larger per capita amount 
the obama administration opposes foreign influence only when that influence promotes a dissenting view obama opposed netanyahus speech to the us congress against the iranian nuclear deal but was happy to give a speech to the uk parliament against brexit the obama administration critiqued israels ngofundingdisclosure law  perhaps because it had sent us taxpayer money to an israeli ngo working to oust israels prime minister 
the same hypocrisy seems to prevail among israels foreignfunded ngos they ostensibly exist to promote democracy and peaceful coexistence but are conspicuously silent when palestinian institutions violate those ideals such silence enables abuse by palestinians and promotes a distorted and incomplete picture of the complex reality in which israelis operate foreignfunded israeli ngos remained silent after the palestinian authority arrested palestinians who visited a sukkah in a symbolic peace event promoting coexistence 
these organizations are silent when the palestinian leadership pays salaries to the families of terrorists glorifies murderers and calls streets and city centers after them netanyahu said these organizations prove again and again that they are not actually interested in human rights but only in shaming israel and libeling it around the world 
if israels leftwing ngos truly are committed to democracy and peace why havent they condemned the pas efforts to prevent normalization with israel in  jibril rajoub the deputy secretary of the fatah central committee and the head of the palestinian supreme council for sport and youth affairs condemned a coexistencepromoting soccer match between israeli and palestinian youths on a southern kibbutz as a crime against humanity 
last week a palestinian newspaper came under intense criticism for publishing an interview with israeli defense minister avigdor liberman the jerusalembased newspaper alquds was denounced by hamas  the palestinian journalists syndicate and the supposedly moderate pa the chilling effects and antipeace message implicit in the harsh reactions to the interview have yet to catch the attention of any leftwing ngos supposedly working for peace and democracy",2016-11-02

after sunday nights polls closed black vot ers accounted for  percent of the inperson early vote ballots cast and that included five previous days of inperson early voting 
but in  in just two days of inperson early voting blacks cast  percent of those early ballots according to dan smith a university of florida political science professor who published some of the early voting data on his mustread election smith blog 
due to such strong africanamerican turnout after the beginning of inperson early voting in  democrats began outpacing republicans in total ballots cast before election day by about  this year though republicans still cling to their own lead of about  as of monday morning about  million absentee and inperson early ballots had been cast  percent of them by republicans and  percent by democrats 
hillary is getting latino support largely due to the immigration debate but she just doesnt have the hot sauce draw that her husband and obama did that leaves her more dependent on white voters and forces her to zigzag between moderate and extreme positions which only adds to her reputation for untrustworthiness",2016-11-02
250,the hostility and hypocrisy of leftwing israeli ngos,"fbi investigates saudi wifeabusing clinton foundation donor in straw donor scheme november   daniel greenfield 
its midnight in america and the clintons and the democratic party keep finding ways to cover themselves in glory im sure the line on this will be that the fbi is acting inappropriately by investigating this investigating political corrupt ion interferes with corrupt politicians being elected 
the fbi is investigating an alleged illegal donation scheme involving a wealthy saudi family that supports democratic florida senate candidate patrick murphy 
murphy who has covered himself in glory so often already is denying everything and i mean absolutely everything 
the murphy campaign declined to say whether the candidate is aware of the fbi probe 
whats your name i decline to answer that question 
murphy  is running against rubio the incumbent republican in a race that could help decide which party controls the senate in  rubio currently leads murphy by an average of  percentage points according to realclearpolitics 
the fbi investigation however relates to murphys first run for the house in the  campaign cycle 
the allegation  originally submitted by a republican super pac run by a former top aide to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rky  is that murphys high school friend and major political donor ibrahim alrashid coordinated a straw donor scheme to boost murphy 
murphy knows nothing 
murphys campaign declined to say whether murphys attorneys had discussed the fbi investigation with alrashids attorney 
uhhuh 
alrashid is the son of a powerful and politically connected saudi billionaire hes been a major financial benefactor of murphys giving almost  to his campaigns and to outside groups supporting the florida congressman 
heres how some of these donations worked 
one example within the alleged scheme a woman who describes herself in federal donation reports as the owner and property manager of a texasbased company limestone property management gave murphys campaign  
but she is neither the property manager nor the owner of the texasbased company in fact she doesnt work there 
she lived in miami at the time and was ibrahim alrashids cleaning lady according to a miamidade police department report filed in  over a home burglary at alrashids property 
texas property manager vs saudis cleaning lady thats quite a difference 
murphy has been forced to return alrashids donations before for purely islamophobic reasons 
alrashids three sons have followed in their fathers political footsteps contributing large sums to top democrats including rep patrick murphy d fla whose senate race could help decide which party controls the senate in  
murphy has already returned a portion of alrashids donations due to his involvement in a domestic assault incident 
ibrahim alrashid allegedly forced his way into his estranged wifes pennsylvania home where alrashid allegedly grabbed her by the wrist struck her about the head and face with a closed fist then threw her to the ground according to a copy of the police report viewed by the free beacon 
following the  incident alrashid allegedly sent his wife a text message stating i am not sorry this time i hope you die in hell according to the police report 
murphy a longtime friend of alrashid was recently forced to donate around  in campaign funds to domestic violence groups after the assault charge became a public liability for the campaign murphy also returned all of the donations made by alrashid during the last three political cycles 
is the clinton foundation involved in this do the clintons do their business in golden and marble toilets 
nasser alrashid one of saudi arabias wealthiest figures and an adviser to the countrys royal family has donated somewhere between  million to  million to the clinton foundation putting him in an elite category of prominent donors

initially the white house chose not to join hillarys war on the fbi then obama threw all caution to the winds and decided to echo the spin chambers lines about innuendo and incomplete information never mind that it was obamas own doj which was blocking fbi efforts to secure the emails and resolve the issue

252,black voters not turning out for hillary,"college forces mandatory microaggression sessions on faculty after prof accuses student of plagiarism november   
college is now a politically correct joke  
suffolk universitys interim president said tuesday that the college will hold mandatory microaggression training for all faculty in response to an outcry last week after a latina student wrote a viral blog post saying she was the victim of a professors racial bias 
what did this racial bias involve 
tiffany martinezsaid an unidentified suffolk sociology professor handed back a paper she had written and in front of the class and told martinez this is not your language insinuating that martinez had plagiarized 
martinez posted a photo of the paper on her blog showing where the professor appears to have written please go back and indicate where you cut and paste the professor had circled the word hence in the paper and wrote this is not your word 
in this interaction my undergraduate career was both challenged and critiqued the student wrote it is worth repeating how my professor assumed i could not use the word hence a simple transitory word that connected two relating statements the professor assumed i could not produce quality research 
most college students regardless of whether their ancestors originated from southern europe or not do not tend to use hence in a sentence hence its the sort of word that professors seize on and suspect that what they are seeing is cut and paste material tiffanys interaction has happened thousands of times with students regardless of race 
but tiffany is lucky enough to be a privileged minority which means that she cant be treated like everyone else lest she whine about it and a flood of social justice crybullies descend on suffolk u 
kelly the interim president also sent a note to the school on friday after the buzzfeed article was posted 
the truth is that all of us here at suffolk should be concerned about any student feeling this way kelly wrote in her tuesday blog post she said the school has experienced an outpouring of support for martinez from other students faculty and staff 
privilege this is what it looks like 
scholars and rogues fights a last stand against the decline and fall of journalism by stating the obvious  
in short what we have here isnt merely iffy reporting on an academic dustup its a microcosm of what has happened to journalism in modern america these headlines are certain to entice web surfers to click and if the reporters can so easily be suckered into outrage then how can we possibly expect a rational reading by the average product of the american ed system which has been stripped of all pretense at teaching critical thinking 
the result an emotionally pitched unsubstantiated claim of injustice has been instantly transformed into cold hard fact 
well yes 
meanwhile heres a sample of tiffanys writing you can decide whether she organically used hence in a sentence 
a declaration of self love 
im familiar negotiating who i am to please others some may call me inauthentic i call this selfprotection however i have burned through my shields too tired to be exhausted this continuous disguise has faded its time i accept myself and no longer sacrifice selflove for overall acceptance

in a fit of thundering insanity hillary clinton her media pals and barack obama decided to go to war with the fbi their pretext was that hillary clinton is supposed to have immunity from the fbi before the election and comey was being irresponsible and violating protocol the hatch act and the thou shalt not impede the electoral prospects of democrats mandate 
most americans have the good sense to think that this is a bunch of rubbish  
hillary clinton and president obama are outraged about the fbidirector james comeys decision to disclose further inquiries into her handling of confidential email but are the american people 
shockingly the american people are not all that outraged about the fbi investigating a corrupt criminal not nearly as much as the corrupt criminal and her political allies are 
in an online morning consult poll of approximately  registered voters only  percent agreed with the statement that prosecutors should wait until after election day to make announcements about investigations concerning political figures or elected officials instead percent agreed that prosecutors should be able to make announcements about investigations concerning political figures or elected officials close to election day even if it might affect the election another  percent said they dont know or had no opinion 
in news thats shocking to the times the american people are once again out of step with their leftwing masters 
when the investigation into mrs clinton was mentioned before the question partisans differed by almost  percentage points in their attitude toward preelection disclosures which were endorsed by  percent of republicans but just  percent of democrats  an even larger gap than observed with the generic prompt by contrast mentioning mr trumps foundation eliminated the gap between the parties in support for publicizing investigations which was backed by  percent of democrats and  percent of republicans

parents who plan on refinancing their homes in order to send their children off to college should instead consider encouraging them to specialize in a trade 
speaking as a phd in philosophy who has spent the last  years teaching at the college level im perhaps the last person from whom advice of this sort is expected but it is precisely because of my familiarity with academia that i beseech the college bound and their enablersi mean their supportersto revisit their plans 
whether one regards a postsecondary institution as a means to either a remunerative profession or a genuine education the tragic fact of the matter is that the contemporary academic world is about as politicized a cultural institution as any more specifically it is a bastion of political correctness a decidedly leftist ideology that tolerates no competition 
for the last  years professor duke pesta who is currently an associate professor of english at the university of wisconsin oshkosh has taught literature at a range of colleges at the outset of each semester he would quiz his students on their knowledge of american and western history what he found is that the overwhelming number of them believed that slaveryan institution mind you that is as old as humanity itself was practiced in virtually every society the planet over and that lasted only some  years in the united states was an exclusively american phenomenon  
most of my students could not tell me anything meaningful about slavery outside of america pesta told the college fix his students are convinced that slavery was an american problem that more or less ended with the civil war and they are very fuzzy about slavery prior to the colonial era 
their entire education about slavery he adds was confined to america 
yet it isnt just students who display an astonishing ignorance of slavery over at boston university saida grundy  an assistant professor of sociology and africanamerican studies tweeted that slavery is a white peoplething 
grundy didnt stop there she asks is white peoples new deflection from dealing with slavery that all races have had slaves thing is this the new alllivesmatter 
professor grundy added other enlightening tweets 
for the record no race outside of europeans had a system that made slavery a personhood instead of temporary condition 
there is also no race except europeans who kidnapped and transported human beings in order to enslave them and their offspring for life 
before europeans invented it as such slavery was not a condition that was de facto inherited from parent to child 
in case white folks couldnt follow the thrust of her rant grundy offers a summation of her sophisticated position 
in other words deal with your white sht white people slavery is a yall thing 
in addition to assigning blame for slavery solely to white europeans grundy claimed that white masculinity is the problem for americas colleges 
over at the university of pittsburgh students who were distributing prodonald trump materials were harassed and attacked  the trump supporters were accused of backing a racist candidate who espouses hate speech they were greeted by chants of fk the white male patriarchy and eventually physical aggression 
one of the victims said that my campus shouldnt be a place where my friends and i are fearful for having opposing opinions 
these students were accosted by other students students elsewhere however have had professors with which to contend 
at the university of california at los angeles ucla a political science professor michael chwe wrote in a blog post for princeton university press that the danger to democracy itself is posed by trump supporters this danger is real and must be confronted chwe maintains that trump and his supporters are the greatest danger to democracy since world war ii even perhaps since the civil war 
chwe thinks that had we done a better and earlier job with confronting as opposed to accommodating white and male privilegewe might not have reached this situation the trump phenomenon we must set our sights on combatting these forms of privilege now though if we hope to divert democracy away from selfdestruction 
and it isnt just faculty in the humanities and liberal arts that cant resist injecting their politics into the classroom a math professor at mount holyoke college an allfemale school was recently captured on video launching into an antitrumpproclinton tirade in class while he never referred to either candidate by name peter rosnicks choice for president was plain this election rosnick said is the scariest that hes ever witnessed he told his students that they should vote for someone who thinks women are full and capable and responsible and intelligent beings who should not be the object of um should not be objectified 
rosnick also prescribed his students to vote for whoever you want but vote for somebody who respects the fact that this is a country built on immigrantsthat this is a country that couldnt that wouldnt be what it is if it wasnt for bringing immigrants into our nation and respecting them and respecting what they bring to our country 
at least one of rosnicks students was less than enthused over his proselytizing efforts speaking on condition of anonymity this student told the college fix that she found it highly inappropriate for a math teacher to use my class time to try to tell me who to vote for

but this unfortunately is hardly an anomaly in  thus parents should think hard before divesting themselves of tens and tens of thousands of dollars so that their children can become targets of political indoctrination",2016-11-02

nothing ought to be plainer and yet nothing is more obscured than the meaning of the islamic concept of jihad even if its meaning were at all unclear every day islamic jihadists do their best to remind us of what it is the confusion arises of course from the fact that jihad and related concepts are the object of a massive misinformation and disinformation campaign making books such as william kilpatricks the politically incorrect guide to jihad so vitally necessary 
kilpatrick covers that propaganda campaign ably in this lucid and genial book which not only explains from islamic texts and teachings why isis and boko haram and other jihad terror groups are not only not unislamic as is frequently claimed but quintessentially islamic  for the quran as kilpatrick explains commands jihad and muhammad who is considered in islamic theology to the perfect man to be imitated by muslims whenever wherever and however possible not only commanded jihad warfare but waged it himself 
kilpatrick also helpfully takes up common objections to this line of argumentation  notably the question of why if islam really teaches warfare against unbelievers and their subjugation under the hegemony of islamic law most muslims are peaceful peaceful islam kilpatrick points out which western leaders are counting on to win out over the more violent versions touted by the terrorists is a holdover from the longdead colonial era indeed so the formulation of jihad as primarily an interior spiritual struggle was touted by islamic scholars at the height of the colonial period so as to allow for accommodation of the colonial occupiers who werent going away in the foreseeable future once they did abscond however the conditions that called forth such accommodative teachings no longer existed and saudifunded jihad preachers traversed the globe calling muslims back to jihad the forgotten obligation of warfare against unbelievers 
the politically incorrect guide to jihad shows that this transition had nothing to do with poverty among muslims or discrimination against them and indeed that no conciliation or concession on the part of western nonmuslims will ever blunt the force of the jihad imperative since it is rooted in islamic theological principles that are not susceptible to the prevailing political winds 
the most valuable sections however of this useful and engaging book are the second jihad without bombs and the third defeating jihad for even as violent jihad becomes an increasingly common feature of the western landscape more insidious and damaging in the long run may be the stealth jihad that proceeds due to the appeasement policies that western governments indefatigably pursue and the politically correct straitjacket on the public discourse that has for well over a decade now hindered and usually prevented outright honest discussion in the mainstream media of the nature and magnitude of this threat kilpatrick points out that according to reporters without borders the us has dropped to fortysixth place in press freedom one of the principal ways in which the press today reveals itself to be a mouthpiece of moneyed elites is in its deliberate attempts to obfuscate the ideological roots of the jihad threat and its ongoing campaign every time there is a jihad attack to inundate us with articles explaining that islam is really quite wonderful and has nothing to do with this violence nothing at all 
but kilpatrick details how the media and governing elites are not in the least singular in appearing determined to foster complacency and ignorance among the people they should be enlightening and protecting the churches are in on the act as well christians writes kilpatrick have been lulled into complacency by the oftrepeated emphasis on the similarities between their faith and the faith of muslims  an emphasis all too many church leaders including of course pope francis relentlessly hammer home heedless of the danger in which they are putting their flock by leaving them intellectually spiritually and physically defenseless in the face of an advancing and growing threat 
thats why the most apposite sentence in this entire book is the second sentence of the chapter headed strategies for victory first weve got to get serious the west suffers from a collective lack of seriousness that could in the end be fatal the frivolity is at the top fueled by globalist internationalists who are using the complacency the media the government and the church are fostering for their own ends the politically incorrect guide to jihad is the perfect book for those who dont know just how bad things are and how likely they are to get even worse  as well as for all who wish to chart a way out of this madness it can be done william kilpatrick does it quite well in this book",2016-11-03

daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
once upon a time factchecking meant that newspapers radio stations and television news broadcasts were obligated to check their facts before broadcasting or publishing them some newspapers and magazines boasted renowned departments filled with intellectuals whose restless minds roved over each line to ensure that the fewest possible errors would appear under that publications masthead 
but factchecking of the media by itself has declined almost as badly as the roman empire errors routinely appear under storied mastheads followed by corrections that are published as a janitorial duty there is very little concern for the facts even among the great names of publishing and broadcasting 
the media has stopped factchecking itself and it now uses factchecking largely to refer to a type of opinion journalism in which it checks the facts of public figures the fall of factchecking within the media has paralleled the rise of fact checking by the media of its political opponents the media has become factless even as it deploys a term that once meant selfcorrection to instead correct others 
fact checks once meant that reporters were expected to be accurate these days theyre only expected to be politically correct the media deploys fact checks to check political correctness not facts its fact checks routinely venture into areas that are not only partisan but subjective matters of opinion 
consider politicos often mocked fact check of donald trump as to whether isis was indeed unbelievably evil under a banner headline donald trumps week of misrepresentations exaggerations and halftruths it zoomed in on a quote from his florida rally 
were presiding over something that the world has not seen the level of evil is unbelievable trump had said 
politico swooped in to correct the candidate with its fact check judging one level of evil against another is subjective but other groups in recent history have without any question engaged in as widespread killing of civilians as isis 
there were no facts being checked here because politico doesnt seem to know what a fact even is 
the only information conveyed by this fact check is that politico like the rest of the media does not like donald trump and would find a way to argue with him if he said that the sky was blue 
in the daily show media culture where overt bias and trolling are virtues factchecking is just another snotty variety of editorializing that attempts to compensate for perceptions of bias not with higher ethical and factual standards but by rebranding its editorials as fact checks to gain credibility 
the isis evil fact check of trump came from the same media outlet whose white house reporter decided that the wisconsin flag which carries the date  to mark the states admission to the union was a flag for the local union wisconsin  politico ran an entire story asserting that obama was flying a labor flag to oppose governor walker because its reporter couldnt process basic history 
this is what happens when media outlets think that factchecking is something that they do to republicans rather than to themselves 
factchecking was one of those dinosaurs of journalism like objectivity which is viewed as largely irrelevant in a media culture whose edward r murrow is jon stewart todays millennial journalists spend most of their time exchanging sarcastic quips with their peers on twitter aspire to found their own vox sites and write viral blog posts that seek a new angle on a trending leftwing narrative 
fact checks often function as narrative defenses and meme attacks thats why the washington post decided to fact check a saturday night live gag about obamas illegal alien amnesty its not that anyone imagines that saturday night live is in the business of producing facts that need checking the post was just worried that one of its jokes would go viral and hurt obama and his agenda 
its the same reason that the paper fact checked a yearold boy who claimed he was blocked by obama on twitter this isnt about the facts its paranoia about social media narratives going viral 
this is more understandable if you stop thinking of the media in the oldfashioned sense as a series of papers radio and television stations and start thinking of it as a massive machine that advocates for leftwing policies using its massive infrastructure and wealth to monopolize internet narratives 
media outlets trade on their history but they dont resemble their past selves in any meaningful way 
the new yorker once boasted a factchecking department that was famous for its range its depth and its resourcefulness in running down even the most obscure facts but what use is such a thing at david remnicks new yorker whose big draw comes from andy borowitzs insipid near parodies the new republic went from respected liberal publication to another snarky and shrill social justice blog cbs news cited a psychic site to explain that a fly landed on hillarys face to help her cope with stress 
this isnt material that exists in the same realm as facts its snarky contempt alternating with lowest common denominator propaganda leftwing journalism like most leftwing culture is totalitarian antiintellectualism masquerading as enlightened intellectualism the soviet union was quite fond of culture it just hated the creative process that produced it because it was independent of communist ideology the left loves journalism it just hates the objectivity that validates journalism as more than propaganda 
its this perverse antiintellectualism that turned factchecking from selfdiscipline to attack ad once journalism became pure leftwing advocacy it also became inherently correct by virtue of being leftwing and was not in need of having its facts checked when fact checks stopped being something that journalists did to themselves first facts and then fact checks became meaningless unable to even recognize a fact media fact checkers just wrote editorials which spiced their leftwing attacks on republicans liberally with cargo cult invocations to fact as if it were some deity 
the average media fact check is a masterpiece of unintentional comedy for thinking adults 
at the washington post  michelle yee fact checks donald trumps comment that hillarys email scandal is bigger than watergate and concludes that since watergate led to nixons resignation and hillarys email scandal has yet to lead to any convictions it cant be bigger than watergate since the scandal has yet to be resolved a fact check of it could only take place in the future 
cnn featured toronto star fact checker daniel dale who claimed that trump said  lies in one day 
the list of lies included deeming trumps statement that hillary would raise taxes false because her plan only taxes the rich asserting that there is no such thing as a phony poll and denying that hillary clinton had received debate questions some of these lies are themselves lies others like yee show an inability to even understand what a fact is and what can and cant be deemed false 
just how degraded fact checking had become was made manifest when hillary clinton pleaded at the debate please fact checkers get to work her campaign site touted its own fact checking which was mostly indistinguishable from the medias fact checking that was a commentary on the transformation of the media into a leftwing politicians spin center 
nearly every media outlet now boasts a fact check blog or headlines touting fact checks but the biggest fact checking department of the media rather than by the media isnt in the united states but in germany in america fact checking has become a type of partisan attack launched by media outlets at their political opponents its bigger than ever and also more worthless than ever because it is factless

the obama department of justice has been corruptly aiding and abetting the democratic partys presidential nominee hillary clinton to escape legal accountability for her actions from attorney general loretta lynch on down through the justice departments political ranks the department has blocked the fbi from searching for the truth and following the evidence of potential criminality to its logical conclusion whether it is hillarys use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state or her involvement in the payforplay clinton enterprise known as the clinton foundation the obama administration is applying a banana republicstyle double standard to pervert justice and the rule of law in order to shield her 
lynch and president obama were reportedly furious with fbi director james comey for sending a letter to congress on october  th indicating that new evidence potentially pertinent to the email case had come to light which required further investigation this evidence consisted of a batch of emails fbi investigators had found on one or more computers belonging to anthony weiner clinton confidante huma abedins estranged husband while they were searching for evidence in an unrelated case involving weiners alleged sexting to an underage girl comey sent his letter after months of agonizing over his previous decision to let hillary off the hook in the email case last july he was said by a source close to him to have been particularly disturbed by the mounting number of resignation letters from fbi agents who felt betrayed by that decision 
department of justice officials had leaned on comey not to send the letter to congress claiming that it would violate department protocols and procedures against taking any action that could be perceived as interfering with the upcoming presidential election to his credit comey ignored the department officials objections claiming he had an obligation to keep the congress and the public informed of any potentially significant new developments in the case 
democrats who had lavished praise on comey for his july decision lashed out at comey for sending his letter updating congress senate minority leader harry reid went so far as to make the baseless charge that comey may have violated the law by informing congress because reid argued he appeared to be taking sides in an election the disgraced former attorney general eric holder held in contempt of congress for withholding information relating to the fast and furious scandal said about comeys action i fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the justice department and the fbi it is up to the director to correct his mistake  not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the american people 
since when has holder been genuinely concerned about protecting our system of justice and best serving the american people holder had already contributed to the erosion of public trust with his blatant politicization of the obama department of justice as evidenced by the obama department of justices handling of the multiple fbi investigations involving hillary clinton the department has continued its slide into the muck of corruption it interfered with both the normal course of criminal investigations and the election by stacking the deck in hillarys favor ensuring that no indictment would occur to derail her path to succeed obama and preserve his legacy 
first the department of justice reportedly refused to empanel a grand jury in either the email case or in connection with the fbis investigation of the clinton foundation payforplay allegations the problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation former assistant fbi director james kallstrom said  thats the problem they never had a grand jury empanelled and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled im sure is loretta lynch would not go along with that 
kallstroms belief that lynch acted to influence the results of the fbi probes in hillarys favor is buttressed by lynchs  minute private tarmac meeting with bill clinton shortly before fbi director comey faced the cameras on july  th with his exculpatory announcement 
second at least five immunity agreements were handed out in the email case including to hillarys lawyer and confidante cheryl mills and to platte river networks paul combetta it appears that combetta had previously lied to government investigators  a crime in itself  while trying to cover up the fact that he had evidently bleachbited emails to delete them even though they had been subject to a previously issued congressional subpoena the immunity agreements garnered nothing in return but had the effect of blocking access to the computer devices of the immunity beneficiaries in the fbis separate clinton foundation investigation apparently the department decided against the alternative option of subpoenaing the computer devices or seeking a search warrant rather than granting useless immunities in order to obtain any evidence relevant to the email investigation that might have been contained in those devices 
third the department and fbi did not conduct their last minute interview of hillary clinton under oath and allowed cheryl mills  herself a material witness  to sit in during hillarys interview they did not ask pertinent followup questions there was no verbatim transcript of the interview to use in checking the veracity of hillarys statements during the interview against her sworn congressional testimony or her many public statements 
fourth the department of justice reportedly refused to allow the fbi to issue subpoenas to gather more evidence in connection with its investigation of the clinton foundation payforplay allegations in fact senior department officials reportedly would not authorize a more thorough fbi investigation because they claimed there was not sufficient evidence gathered thus far to justify going further such a circular argument was a mere cover to prevent seasoned career investigators from learning the full extent of foreign government donations while hillary was secretary of state their true motivations and any favors extended by the state department in return 
finally the crossconnections between the clintons and some high level department of justice and fbi officials cry out for recusal but not so in this administration for example the wife of the deputy fbi director who was involved in the laggard clinton foundation investigation andrew mccabe just happened to have received a large donation from close clinton ally virginia governor terry mcauliffe to her  run for the state senate 
to make matters worse the obama department of justice assigned assistant attorney general peter j kadzik a close friend of hillary clintons campaign manager john podesta to communicate with congress about what kadzik promised would be a thorough review of the newly discovered emails from anthony weiners online account 
podesta praised kadzik in an email to an obama campaign official back in  as a fantastic lawyer and said about his pal kept me out of jail their history together goes further back than that during the waning days of bill clintons presidency it was kadzik then representing the infamous billionaire fugitive marc rich who lobbied podesta then serving as bill clintons chief of staff for a presidential pardon on his clients behalf kadziks lobbying effort no doubt helped along by contributions to hillary clintons senate campaign and to bill clintons presidential library paid off bill clinton delivered the requested pardon on his last day in office 
kadzik joined the department of justice in april  first as a deputy assistant attorney general for legislative affairs and then as the principal deputy with the podesta connection intact kadzik has served as a highly placed clinton campaign mole in the department an email dated may   from kadzik to podesta released by wikileaks  proves the point bearing the subject heading heads up kadzik advised podesta about upcoming congressional testimony by the head of the departments civil division and about another filing in the freedom of information case that would mean it will be awhile  before the state department posts the emails podesta forwarded kadziks heads up email to several senior hillary clinton campaign officials with the admonition additional chances for mischief 
exploiting his coordinating role in the reopened email investigation and contacts with fbi investigators kadzik will now be in a position to relay inside information to his pal podesta and to provide inside information to the clinton campaigns supporters in congress as well

just one of those honest mistakes leading to a massive violation of national security by anyone who felt like it these are still reports from various insider sources but if true this would be a major factor in how much damage hillarys cover up did  
authorities now believe there is about a  percent chance that up to five foreign intelligence agencies may have accessed and taken emails from hillary clintons private server two separate sources with intimate knowledge of the fbi investigations told fox news 
the revelation led house homeland security committee chairman michael mccaul to describe clintons handling of her email system during her tenure as secretary of state as treason 
she exposed information to our enemies mccaul said on fox  friends thursday morning our adversaries have this very sensitive information  in my opinion quite frankly its treason 
mccaul rtexas said that fbi director james comey told him previously that foreign adversaries likely had gotten into her server when comey publicly discussed the clinton email case back in july he also said that while there was no evidence hostile actors breached the server it was possible they had gained access

rerun brexit through parliament and maximize the wrangling the courts ruling is certain to do that keep it going through the grinder long enough and maybe itll go away",2016-11-03
260,obama doj handmaiden of clinton corruption,"fbi wiretapped corruption suspect discussing clinton deals november   daniel greenfield 
if youre wondering why team hillary panicked and unleashed hell on the fbi this may be another ingredient in the stew the wall street journal article is clearly trying to spin things to the left and damage the credibility of the fbi but its an interesting data point  
the fbi had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a publiccorruption case talking about alleged deals the clintons made these people said the agents listening to the recordings couldnt tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate but it was they thought worth checking out 
prosecutors thought the talk was hearsay and a weak basis to warrant aggressive tactics like presenting evidence to a grand jury because the person who was secretly recorded wasnt inside the clinton foundation 
fbi investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors and some executives at the bureau itself to keep pursuing the case 
as prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly those justice department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didnt seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly 
in short fbi people had material for a case that the government didnt want brought because team obama were hillary backers and the senior leadership in the doj saw their careers linked to the rise of hillary and so a stand down order was handed down 
following the february meeting officials at justice department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to stand down a person familiar with the matter said 
this is what happens when the doj has been so thoroughly corrupted from the top down 
meanwhile theres little doubt considering what we already know that the doj people had been updating hillarys people on the fbi investigation should those emails come out they will be some of the most damning of all and so hillarys people panicked and decided to pull the trigger",2016-11-03
261,fbi believes  foreign intel agencies got into hillarys server,"obamas doj issued stand down order on clinton foundation investigation november   
there have been various insider reports on the clinton foundation and the hillary email scandal on fox 
but the curious thing about this wall street journal report is that its clearly aimed at defending hillary clinton and smearing the fbi in the battle with obamas doj officials who wanted to shut it down due to their support of hillary clinton 
which means that its information that damns its own side gains more credibility 
justice department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions 
following the february meeting officials at justice department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to stand down a person familiar with the matter said 
a stand down order much like the one in libya 
and remember mccabe whose wifes democratic political campaign received major cash from a clinton ally 
amid the internal fingerpointing on the clinton foundation matter some have blamed the fbis no  official deputy director andrew mccabe claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer his defenders deny that and say it was the justice department that kept pushing back on the investigation 
not a surprise either 
the fbi had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a publiccorruption case talking about alleged deals the clintons made these people said the agents listening to the recordings couldnt tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate but it was they thought worth checking out 
fbi investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors and some executives at the bureau itself to keep pursuing the case 
as prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly those justice department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didnt seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly 
and thats what blew up when team hillary lashed out at the fbi it was a covert war between hillarys doj allies and the fbi coming out of the cold and they pushed so hard even mccabe was disgusted 
as a result of those complaints these people said a senior justice department official called the fbi deputy director mr mccabe on aug  to say the agents in new york seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions these people said the conversation was a tense one they said and at one point mr mccabe asked are you telling me that i need to shut down a validly predicated investigation the senior justice department official replied of course not

microsoft cofounder bill gates having a net worth of  billion and amazoncom ceo jeff bezos having a net worth of  billion are the nations two richest men they are at the top of the forbes  list of americas superrich individuals people who have net worths of billions of dollars many see the rich as a danger new york times columnist bob herbert wrote it doesnt really matter what ordinary people want the wealthy call the tune and the politicians dance his colleague paul krugman wrote on paper were a onepersononevote nation in reality were more than a bit of an oligarchy in which a handful of wealthy people dominate its sentiments like these that have led me to wish there were a humane way to get rid of the rich for without having the rich around to be whipping boys and distract our attention we might be able to concentrate on whats best for the  percent of the rest of us 
lets look at the power of the rich with all the money that gates bezos and other superrich people have what can they force you or me to do can they condemn our houses to create space so that another individual can build an auto dealership or a casino parking lot can they force us to pay money into the governmentrun  and doomed  obamacare program can they force us to bus our children to schools out of our neighborhood in the name of diversity can they force us to buy our sugar from a highcost domestic producer rather than from a lowcost caribbean producer the answer to all of these questions is a big fat no 
you say williams i dont understand let me be more explicit bill gates cannot order you to enroll your child in another school in order to promote racial diversity he has no power to condemn your house to make way for a casino parking lot unless our elected public officials grant them the power to rip us off rich people have little power to force us to do anything a lowly municipal clerk earning  a year has far more lifeanddeath power over us it is that type of person to whom we must turn for permission to build a house ply a trade open a restaurant and do myriad other activities its government people not rich people who have the power to coerce us and rip us off they have the power to make our lives miserable if we disobey this coercive power goes a long way toward explaining legalized political corruption 
take just one of thousands of examples the fanjuls are among the biggest sugar cane growers and they coown the worlds largest refining company american sugar refining which markets its product under the brand names domino ch redpath tate  lyle and florida crystals during the  election cycle florida crystals contributed more than  to candidates and political spending groups it spent more than  million lobbying congress the us departments of agriculture and commerce and the office of the us trade representative heres my question to you do you think it forked over all that money to help our elected representatives uphold and defend the us constitution nonsense the fanjuls and other sugar producers want congress to use tariffs to keep foreignproduced sugar out of our country so they can reap the financial benefits from being able to charge americans two to three times the world price of sugar 
so heres the ultimate question if some rich people can line the pockets of politicians to do their bidding at the expense of the rest of us whos to blame i think its we the people who are to blame for not using our votes to run such politicians out of town  and thats most of them but that might be deceitful of us for we also ask politicians to enable us to live at the expense of others",2016-11-03
264,obamas doj issued stand down order on clinton foundation investigation,"david frum hillary is a patriot who will protect the constitution november   daniel greenfield 
if david frum had suggested that hillary clinton used to play for the patriots i would have found his argument a little more credible than claiming that she is a patriot 
but she is a patriot she will uphold the sovereignty and independence of the united states she will defend allies she will execute the laws with reasonable impartiality she may bend some rules for her own and her supporters advantage she will not outright defy legality altogether above all she can govern herself the first indispensable qualification for governing others 
this is under an atlantic piece headlined the conservative case for hillary which also contends why support a candidate who rejects your preferences and offends your opinions dont do it for herdo it for the republic and the constitution 
the trouble with this line of argument is that hillarys own agenda includes a rejection of the first and second amendment its a rather unusual way to support the constitution by destroying it 
then theres the whole hillary is a quarterback for the new england patriots business who has ever accused hillary clinton of being a patriot how was this patriotism manifested in benghazi in iran in russia ill skip over the outright defy legality altogether argument though its certainly sad that this is now considered some sort of high water mark 
but can hillary govern herself is the compulsive liar who cant help shouting i was in new york on  really capable of governing herself

265,hillarys castro endorsement,"nigerian novelist wonders why everyone loves hillary november   daniel greenfield 
why does everyone love hillary clinton its hard to say her unfavorable ratings have hit  that makes her more popular than 
 the bubonic plague 
 obamacare 
 osama bin ladens corpse 
its not much to go on but the atlantic decided to run a piece by chimamanda adichie titledwhy is hillary clinton so widely loved 
your response to seeing the name chimamanda adichie was probably huh unless youre a gender studies student at an ivy in which case you know exactly who she is and love her chimamanda adichie is a nigerian novelist whose we should all be feminists is big in those circles 
the clinton campaign is unbearably awkward and this panegyric by adichie was an obvious attempt to channel some of that canned obama poetry and like most hillary branding it fails badly 
there are howlers like there are millions who admire the tapestry of hillary clintons past and there are people who when hillary clinton becomes the first woman to be president of the united states will weep from joy its not quite a hymn to comrade stalin nor is it getting there by any means except a tow truck 
and then theres the phrasing oh the phrasing hillary clinton was guilty immediately when she stepped into the view of the american public as the first lady of arkansas 
this is an awkward attempt to channel that obama poetry but instead it reads like a dvd manual badly translated from the japanese 
the atlantic piece is full of lines that straddle the border between tineared propagandistic cliche and just bad writing 
she was a lawyer full of dreams 
she was guilty of not being a traditional first lady she offended the old patriarchal order 
then theres the theme of the article which is to just deny reality 
a conservative writer labeled her a congenital liar when she was first lady and the label stuck because it was repeated over and overand it was a convenient label to harness misogyny if she was a liar then the hostility she engendered could not possibly be because she was a first lady who refused to be still and silent liar has reemerged during this election even though politifact a respected source of information about politicians has certified that she is more honest than most politicians 
the perfect timing for that defense would have been not right after hillary clinton shouted at a rally that she had been in new york on  but dont worry hillary is more honest than most politicians a site supporting her said so 
 other words have been repeated over and over with no context until they have begun to breathe and thrum with life especially emails the press coverage of emails has become an unclear morass where emails must mean something terrible if only because of how often it is invoked 
how about classified emails or illegal server or violation of regulations dealing with the handling of classified material thats got lots of context or coverup 
the people who love hillary clinton know that the it system at the state department is old and stodgy nothing like a blackberrys smooth whirl hillary clinton was used to her blackberry and wanted to keep using it when she became secretary of state 
people who love hillary know that she love high tech blackberry hillary love blackberry she is a lawyer full of dreams who fights for the children of migrant workers and loves their smooth whirl politifact thrums with life says her blackberry is more honest than the iphone hillary has many dreams of thrumming blackberries whirling smoothly that offend the traditional stodgy patriarchal order it system 
the american conservative media saw an opportunity to blow the emails story out of proportion soon followed almost bashfully by the rest of the american media 
is that how it works in nigeria because thats not how it works in america 
there is no objective basis on which to equate hillary clinton to her opponent 
theyre both mammals they need oxygen to live theyre better writers than chimamanda adichie 
the people who love hillary clinton see the failings of the general american media where news entertains rather than informs they bristle when benign stories about her are covered with an ominous tone 
they bristle and they hug their blackberry and weep for they fear that the patriarchal stodgy it systems will prevent hillary from being the thrumming first lady of north america 
they know that she is a bit too careful but they understand that she has to be that she cannot afford spontaneity 
you would think with all those six figure speeches she could afford a little 
her actions so falsely magnified that she leaned into caution wrapped herself in a kind of caution that sometimes makes her appear stilted  
and wrapped in her caution her whirling blackberry in one hand she bristled at the public retracting her quills and occasionally hissing in an informed fashion for the children of migrant workers who admired the tapestry of her past 
there are millions of americans who do not have the selfindulgent expectation that a politician be perfect they are frustrated that hillary clinton is allowed no complexity

266,the rich and us,"daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
in the final stretch of the election hillary rodham clinton has gone to war with the fbi 
the word unprecedented has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired but its still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the fbi 
but thats exactly what hillary and her people have done coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of cnn from their hospital beds would assume that fbi director james comey is hillarys opponent in this election 
the fbi is under attack by everyone from obama to cnn hillarys people have circulated a letter attacking comey there are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting trump it wouldnt be too surprising if the clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the fbi 
the fbis leadership is being warned that the entire leftwing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after hillary and the fbis credibility is being attacked by the media and the democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the clinton foundation and hillary clinton 
the covert struggle between fbi agents and obamas doj people has gone explosively public 
the new york times has compared comey to j edgar hoover its bizarre headline james comey role recalls hoovers fbi fairly or not practically admits up front that its spouting nonsense the boston globe has published a column calling for comeys resignation not to be outdone time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women 
james carville appeared on msnbc to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane he accused comey of coordinating with house republicans and the kgb and you thought the vast right wing conspiracy was a stretch 
countless media stories charge comey with violating procedure do you know whats a procedural violation emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server 
senator harry reid has sent comey a letter accusing him of violating the hatch act the hatch act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of obama as the tenth amendment but the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the wikipedia article on the hatch act under the table while accusing the fbi director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against hillary ever 
if james comey is really out to hurt hillary he picked one hell of a strange way to do it 
not too long ago democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave hillary clinton a pass in a prominent public statement if he really were out to elect trump by keeping the email scandal going why did he trash the investigation was he on the payroll of house republicans and the kgb back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where vladimir putin and paul ryan talked him into taking a look at anthony weiners computer 
either comey is the most cunning fbi director that ever lived or hes just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a doj leadership whose political futures are tied to hillarys victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs 
the only truly mysterious thing is why hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected federal agency most americans like the fbi while hillary clinton enjoys a  unfavorable rating 
and its an interesting question 
hillarys old strategy was to lie and deny that the fbi even had a criminal investigation underway instead her associates insisted that it was a security review the fbi corrected her and she shrugged it off but the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the fbi 
pretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy but it was a better one that picking a fight with the fbi while lunatic clinton associates try to claim that the fbi is really the kgb 
there are two possible explanations 
hillary clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the fbi now that she believes that victory is near the same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the fbi for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign 
but the other explanation is that her people panicked 
going to war with the fbi is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign its an act of desperation when a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the fbi thats not hubris its fear of what the fbi might be about to reveal about her 
during the original fbi investigation hillary clinton was confident that she could ride it out and she had good reason for believing that but that hillary clinton is gone in her place is a paranoid wreck within a short space of time the positive clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the fbi 
theres only one reason for such bizarre behavior 
the clinton campaign has decided that an fbi investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival and so its gone all in on fighting the fbi its an unprecedented step born of fear its hard to know whether that fear is justified but the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot 
clinton loyalists rigged the old investigation they knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions now suddenly they are no longer in control and they are afraid 
you can smell the fear 
the fbi has wiretaps from the investigation of the clinton foundation its finding new emails all the time and clintonworld panicked the spinmeisters of clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire all thats here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance but this isnt how you react to smoke its how you respond to a fire 
the misguided assault on the fbi tells us that hillary clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup the email setup was a preemptive cover up the clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief right or wrong that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed 
the clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption bribery sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years this is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out and they dont want fbi investigators anywhere near it 
the campaign against comey is pure intimidation its also a warning any senior fbi people who value their careers are being warned to stay away the democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the fbi its an ugly and unprecedented scene it may also be their last stand 
hillary clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle but shes never shown fear or desperation before now that has changed whatever she is afraid of it lies buried in her emails with huma abedin and it can bring her down like nothing else has",2016-11-03
267,david frum hillary is a patriot who will protect the constitution,"european media jihad against geert wilders as they lose their grip the political and media elites are getting desperate november   robert spencer 
the mainstream media in western europe and north america isnt even pretending to be an objective news source anymore instead journalists are working openly to quell what looks increasingly on both sides of the atlantic like a popular revolution against the hegemony of the selfappointed political and media aristocracy that seems hellbent on driving western civilization over the cliff and so its time for another round of their twominutes hate against dutch politician and freedom fighter geert wilders 
wilders has yet again gone on trial in the netherlands for hate speech and this time the case against him is especially flimsy as europe is roiled by the criminal activity of muslim migrants he is being accused of hate speech for saying that the massive influx of immigrants from morocco from which most of the muslim migrants in the netherlands come has to be stopped 
this trial could very easily backfire on the dutch inquisitors and make wilders more popular than ever with the people of the netherlands and europe in general as they are increasingly fed up with the political and media elites forcing them to accept a massive influx of muslim migrants that ensures a future only of civil strife bloodshed and sharia oppression 
consequently those elites are trying desperately to shore up their position wilders chanted no more moroccans at a rally the horror to any sane person this means stop the influx of moroccan immigrants who only inflate crime rates and welfare rolls to the media which at this point is quite insane insofar as insanity means an inability or refusal to accept reality this means genocide 
and so in this deutsche welle dw piece by freelance journalist teri schultz were told that european parliament lawmaker cecile kyenge who was born in congo had numerous racial slurs  not to mention bananas literally  thrown at her along with suggestions she go back to her country does this have anything to do with the crime and civil strife that are the foundations for wilders position of course not but wilders schultz tells us is of course farright that allpurpose and meaningless semaphore that serves only to signal to rightthinking deutsche welle readers that wilders is as far as the media elites are concerned unsavory and must be opposed and shunned his positions left unexamined 
schultz contacted me to serve as the villain of her piece being sure to tell her hapless readers that i am known for extreme antiislam views to make sure that if any of them are foolish enough to find themselves agreeing with me they will immediately reverse themselves and get their minds right the term extreme also since the western governing class unanimously refers to jihad terrorists as extremists also implies that i am a terrorist 
after the article came out i challenged schultz on this she replied i dont think even you would consider your views mainstream do you i responded absolutely yes my views were the broad mainstream in the western world from  ad until the s what changed not islamic teaching to that she said okay youd have to argue it with another expert which i am not but thanks again for contributing indeed she is just a mouthpiece for the views the political and media elites want us to hold 
in any case schultzs article merely reveals the desperation of the ruling class and the selfappointed opinionshapers they can call those of us who wish to defend the people and culture of europe and north america farright and extreme every day and they do but the public can see with their eyes what is happening wilders popularity isnt growing because he is a charming fellow which is of course not to say that he isnt its growing because he speaks the truths that the political and media elites are in a frenzy to obscure 
and its only going to get worse for them the brexit vote and the trump candidacy whether he wins or loses shows that their hegemony is beginning to be challenged those challenges will continue and grow they will before too long be decisively voted out and repudiated",2016-11-03
268,nigerian novelist wonders why everyone loves hillary,"obamas weighs options for his final stab at israel in his twilight months in office obama seeks to undermine americas closest ally november   ari lieberman 
israelis and the proisrael community at large will breathe a collective sigh of relief when obama leaves office during obamas tenure relations with israel were caustic at best barely five months after taking office he publicly launched a scathing attack against israel  where he perversely insinuated a moral equivalence between israeli and palestinian actions  and did so in one of the most virulently antisemitic countries on the planet he later skipped over israel despite the fact that israel was a mere minute plane ride away that was obamas opening salvo against americas closest ally it was only downhill from there 
obama utilized highlevel administration sources to leak negative information about israel to sympathetic members of the press in one such instance an administration official probably ben rhodes  referred to prime minister benjamin netanyahu as a  chickensht  in another instance obama voiced concurrence with french president nicholas sarkozy when sarkozy characterized netanyahu as a  liar  
often the obama administration would subject israeli dignitaries to humiliating treatment during official state visits israels defense minister moshe yaalon was shamefully transformed into a persona non grata in the most notorious incident obama left netanyahu out in the cold while having dinner with michelle and his daughters one commentator dryly noted that obama treated netanyahu as though he was the president of equatorial guinea 
ultimately obama crossed the line and received significant pushback from democratic lawmakers and donors obama got the message and toned down the rhetoric but his deepseeded animus against israel never dissipated and relations with israels prime minister remained toxic 
tensions surfaced again during israels counter insurgency campaign against the gazabased terror group hamas obama held up a shipment of hellfire missiles to israel and then tried to strongarm israel into accepting a suicidal ceasefire agreement brokered by turkey and qatar two despotic nations that support hamas and gave aid and comfort to islamic state terrorists 
obama saw netanyahus opposition to the jcpoa the socalled iran deal as a personal attack and allowed his petulant nature to further sour relations the socalled settlements were another point of contention obama disregarded a letter of assurance to israel provided by the bush administration specifying that in light of new realities on the ground including already existing major israeli populations centers it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of  
bush gave implicit recognition to existing settlement blocs and the right of israel to build within those blocs it is also important to note that no new settlement was created during obamas term of office and netanyahu had even agreed to an unprecedented month moratorium on construction within the disputed territories but nothing was ever enough for obama who never wasted an opportunity to excoriate israel at every turn his parting shot was at the united nations general assembly during a recent address to that contemptible body he explicitly singled out israel for criticism but heaped praise on the xenophobic nation of indonesia obamas moral compass had gone completely awry 
despite the fact that obama is in his twilight months he can still inflict immeasurable harm on israel according to a report featured in the wall street journal  obama is contemplating several options each with significant negative implications for israel the report noted that he will only implement those options during the transitional period after november  so as not to harm clintons presidential prospects 
he may seek to remove tax exempt status for organizations supportive of israeli communities living in east jerusalem judea and samaria perhaps more ominously he may seek to impose dictates on israel utilizing the un security council 
in one such scenario obama may seek to pass a resolution condemning settlement construction and declaring israeli communities situated in judea and samaria to be illegal alternatively the administration may seek formal recognition of the state of palestine even though such a state has no formal boundaries and rejects israels existence as a jewish state lastly he is said to be considering the possibility of setting up the parameters of a future peace agreement that would entail significant israeli territorial concessions 
the united states does not have to actively support any unsc resolution to see the successful passage of antiisraeli measures it merely has to fail to exercise its veto powers france facing significant problems of its own in connection with its growing radicalized muslim population has historically been the fiercest advocate for the palestinian arabs it is likely that the administration would seek to have the french submit a draft resolution and the united states would simply abstain while the permanent and nonpermanent members voted thus guaranteeing passage 
israel has few friends on the security council and american collusion with a body that could arguably be considered todays greatest purveyors of antisemitism would be an act of extreme betrayal it would also represent bad policy and would significantly complicate efforts to broker a future peace agreement 
but israel is not without recourse there is strong bipartisan support for israel in congress and lawmakers from both sides of the political divide have already expressed to the white house their strong opposition to un involvement 
some like the jerusalem posts caroline glick have suggested that the israelis can reach out to the russians with carrots in an effort to counter obamas nefarious plans but this option seems to be a stretch moscow has always been in the pockets of the muslim bloc and its recent vote at unesco in support of a resolution denying the jewish nexus to jerusalem serves to reinforce this view moreover even if russia can be persuaded relying on putin for favors is akin to borrowing money from the mafia and would come with a steep price

269,you can smell hillarys fear,"the president and hillary clinton share a stubborn desire to avoid scrutiny november   lloyd billingsley 
the president of the united states the most powerful man in the world is working three shifts for his designated successor former first lady and secretary of state hillary clinton as the fbi continues its investigations and clinton emails continue to emerge it is worth recalling the mysteries in the presidents narrative 
last year obamas narrator as the new york times called david axelrod released his massive believer  my forty years in politics  the author recalls a perfectly timed and unexpected call that would change his life 
david its barack said the voice on the phone im thinking about what i want to do next and was wondering if we could talk this call took place in  which explains the perfect timing 
on february   the presidents maternal grandfather stanley dunham passed away at  so gramps as the narrator called him was no longer around to offer insights on family history correct any accounts that might appear or write one of his own 
in the  dreams from my father gramps might say that a kenyan foreign student looks a lot like nat king cole actually gramps might not the kenyan student barack h obama bears little resemblance to cole who passed away in  but enjoyed a revival in the s through daughter natalies unforgettable album 
the narrator of dreams from my father invokes a stubborn desire to protect myself from scrutiny and he doesnt fault people their suspicions if they fail to take him at face value his elusive father is a prop in someone elses narrative and an image i could alter on a whim or ignore when convenient the narrative itself is a myth a tale and a useful fiction 
dreams from my father has no photo section no index and key characters get only a first name these include frank who gets  words back in  the president himself identified this person as frank marshall davis the stalinist paul kengor regards as the presidents mentor as he explained in the communist the untold story of frank marshall davis  
in dreams from my real father  documentarian joel gilbert made a case that davis is the presidents biological father malik obama son of the kenyan barack h obama sees a strong physical resemblance  that also holds true on the policy side professor kengor found remarkable similarities between the writings of davis and the policies of president barack obama 
the kenyan barack obama though a man of the left was not a prosoviet communist had he been prosoviet he would have attended patrice lumumba university in moscow indeed obama warned his fellow kenyans about soviet meddling in africa 
the kenyan obama would have found strange the presidents  cancelation of missile defense for european allies an outspoken man he would not have supported the kind of hightech harassment sharyl attkisson described in stonewalled my fight for truth against the forces of obstruction intimidation and harassment in obamas washington  
the kenyan barack h obama had issues with strongman types such as jomo kenyatta who ruled kenya from  until his death in  in keeping with his country and most of africa the kenyan barack obama is not on record as a supporter of homosexual causes frank marshall davis on the other hand was certainly on board as davis wrote in his  memoir livin the blues  
during the dramatic civil rights demonstrations of the s i often thought we ought to form a united front with joint sitins at cafes in my mind i envisioned the result an indignant white restaurant manager frantically phoning the police get here in a hurry we got niggers at our counters and our washrooms are loaded with fairies and lesbians or perhaps there might have been a joint march on washington waving banners blacks and homos arise 
that and davis pornographic novel sex rebel black  might explain the presidents stubborn desire to protect himself from scrutiny it could also have something do with what the narrator calls the less flattering aspects of my fathers character 
in dreams from my father  the kenyan is raised a muslim but in the audacity of hope he is a confirmed atheist thinking religion to be so much superstition like the mumbojumbo of witch doctors that he had witnessed in the kenyan villages of his youth 
in audacity  the narrator explains that he went to a predominantly muslim school in indonesia he does not indicate whether atheists lutherans jews or buddhists also attended the school registration records were supposedly destroyed by flooding 
the predominantly muslim school also emerges in believer  but axelrod does not indicate if students of other faiths attended frank ann dunham stanley dunham and even the kenyan barack obama are missing from this account but it proves enlightening in other ways 
in a  brian williams of msnbc asked presidential candidates what steps they would take in the event of a simultaneous terror attack on major american cities as axelrod explains obama neglected to include that he would pursue the perpetrators 
hillary clinton did likewise in  passing off what she privately regarded as a terrorist attack on the us compound in benghazi as a spontaneous protest over a video like the president clinton has always shown a stubborn desire to protect herself from scrutiny with bleachbit  hammers and lies hillary and her handlers did their best to make more than  emails disappear 
the contents remain something of a mystery just as mysteries linger about the president and his background on the other hand by now some things are perfectly clear 
the potus and former flotus both decline to identify islamic terrorism both are shrinkwrapped in statist superstition and both lie with the greatest of ease on these counts like the critters in orwells animal farm one can find it impossible to say which was which 
back in july the party faithful were chanting four more years during the presidents speech at the democratic national convention",2016-11-04
270,european media jihad against geert wilders,"why time magazines joe klein is so wrong about hillary clinton rebutting the absurd claims of my namesake november   joseph klein 
time magazines joe klein has just penned an article entitled why hillary clinton is the only choice to keep america great i feel duty bound to respond to at least the most absurd of the comments made by namesake and author of primary colors the novel based on about bill clintons first presidential campaign in  
the other joe klein laments that hillary has been so severely damaged in the course of the year battering shes received at the hands of extremists and the media sorry but hillarys wounds are selfinflicted her lies greed and corruption go back decades and have now reached a crescendo with the dual scandals of her use of a private server for state department business while she was secretary of state and of the payforplay clinton foundation 
there is one part of trump that is indisputably real his ego the other joe klein wrote as if hillary were the epitome of humility and grace 
those who would put clintons failings in the same league as trumps depravities are delusional declared klein i agree with his statement but for precisely the opposite reason that he advances trump did not abuse a public office for personal gain he did not hand pick hillarys word an ambassador to serve in one of the most dangerous countries in the world and then never respond to his multiple requests for enhanced security let alone pick up the phone and contact ambassador chris stevens directly the government was not able to save four lives to keep four lives safe how can you keep a country safe asked stevens former fiancé in a rhetorical question that hillary would be unable to answer trump did not lie to the families of those slain in benghazi as hillary did trump did not put national security at risk by using a private server for government emails in order to evade the freedom of information act as hillary did 
in short anyone who thinks that hillarys proven record of recklessness mendacity and indifference is not more troubling by several orders of magnitude than trumps depravities is delusional 
the other joe klein complains that trump deals in stereotypes  the blacks the hispanics the muslims the women and yes even the veterans yet much of hillarys pitch is genderbased elect her because she is a woman and she attacks millions of people who support her opponent with vile epithets  deplorable racist sexist homophobic xenophobic islamaphobic and  for good measure  irredeemable 
the other joe klein charges that trump is about all that has gone wrong in our society and nothing of what has gone right to paraphrase bill clinton that would depend on what your definitions of wrong and right are is hillary clinton really right when she parrots black lives matters stereotypical attacks on what she herself has characterized as white privilege and systemic racism in this country is she right when she leaps to conclusions about police brutality aimed against africanamericans before the evidence in specific cases is carefully examined i dont think so 
hillary also represents the political correctness and antireligious bigotry of the secular left elite that many americans believe are what truly have gone wrong in our society at the women in the world summit last year for example hillary said that in order to fully secure the reproductive rights of women deepseated cultural codes religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed hillary demeaned the sincerely held religious belief in the sanctity of life held by millions of americans reminiscent of president obamas contemptuous clinging to religion quote back in  
hillarys key supporters and top aides have targeted the catholic church in particular for their notion of progressive reform there needs to be a catholic spring in which catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the catholic church wrote sandy newman president of voices for progress in an email to clintons campaign chairman john podesta in response podesta picked up on the spring theme he wrote we created catholics in alliance for the common good to organize for a moment like this but i think it lacks the leadership to do so now likewise catholics united like most spring movements i think this one will have to be bottom up 
when time magazines joe klein talks about what is right or wrong in american society he should get out of his washington dc bubble more often and actually speak with the american people about their daytoday concerns even if hillary clinton ends up winning the election the country will remain divided and she will have no mandate whatsoever to advance her progressive agenda",2016-11-04
271,obamas weighs options for his final stab at israel,"the unraveling of hillarys corrupt sphere of influence november   michael cutler 
the  elections are in the final stretch and were shaken to the core by the latest revelations from fbi director james comey on friday october   as reported by nbc news on october  th   fbi obtains warrant for newly discovered emails in clinton probe  as reid accuses comey of hatch act violation  once again the clinton scandal is creating turmoil in a presidential election that has gone way beyond unconventional indeed tom clancy could not have scripted this years presidential election and intrigues 
while comeys recent remarks regarding the clinton investigation have been extremely vague the issue to focus on is how hillarys use of a private computer server private email account and nonsecure digital devices to store send and receive classified materials may have drawn others into her tangled web of deception 
the current focus of the clinton quagmire is on whether or not the laptop computer shared by weiner and his estranged wife contains sensitive information if that laptop had been hacked both weiner and abedin could have been vulnerable to blackmail this was an issue raised by congressman louie gohmert texan republican and former judge in a fox news business interview on october   in a segment that was posted under the title  rep gohmert clinton is a potential victim of blackmail  
additional individuals may also have been drawn into this web of deception through these emails as well a chain is as strong as its weakest link the weak links begin with hillary clinton and huma abedin and may now include anthony weiner and perhaps others meanwhile there is no way to yet determine how many other weak links are out there petrified that wikileaks or perhaps a hacker may yet disclose their improper dealings with the clintons or their foundation 
could not these additional individuals be subject to blackmail as well 
lets take a moment to understand how all of this began 
just months earlier hillary clinton had been let off the hook by an fbi director who in his official statement on july    included this excerpt to be clear this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences to the contrary those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions but that is not what we are deciding now 
by comeys own words anyone else might have had their security clearance lifted permanently this raises the issue about such an individual demonstrating fitness for duty as president and raises the question as to why comey did not see fit to take comparable action with ms clinton 
comeys ultimate decision to not present the case to a grand jury was frustrating to those who have had security clearances and fully understand just how profound an impact these transgressions might have on national security 
however perhaps comeys hard to comprehend decision can be traced to a meeting between bill clinton and attorney general loretta lynch less than one week before the fbi director conducted that press conference on june   abc news reported  us attorney general loretta lynch bill clinton meet privately in phoenix before benghazi report  
that article served as a predication for my article  loretta lynchs private meeting with bill clinton prior to release of benghazi report  why would the attorney general who sets the tone for law enforcement do this 
as attorney general lynch is fbi director comeys boss 
at the time of this meeting the justice department was not only investigating hillarys illegal use of a private email server nonsecure personal digital devices but was also conducting an investigation into the clinton foundation 
in fact on october   breitbart reported  clinton foundation fbi investigation confirmed by former assistant fbi director  therefore bill clinton was likely the target of an ongoing criminal investigation yet he had a totally inappropriate private meeting with the attorney general to supposedly discuss golfing and grandchildren 
however just days after that meeting news organizations reported that hillary was contemplating keeping lynch on as attorney general if she won the election 
on july   newsmax reported  ny times clinton weighs keeping lynch as attorney general if she wins  hillarys statement that she might keep lynch on as attorney general could have provided the incentive for lynch to go along to get along 
indeed lynch did precisely that during her confirmation hearing as i described in my commentary  loretta lynch same as the old boss  the attorney general nominees disturbing views on us immigration law 
my article included an excerpt from a yahooap news report attorney general nominee defends obama immigration changes here is the exchange in which lynch discussed the administrations immigrations policies lynch said she had no involvement in drafting the measures but called them a reasonable way to marshal limited resources to deal with the problem of illegal immigration she said the homeland security department was focusing on removals of the most dangerous of the undocumented immigrants among us pressed by sen jeff sessions of alabama a leading immigration hardliner she said citizenship was not a right for people in the country illegally but rather a privilege that must be earned however when sessions asked whether individuals in the country legally or those who are here unlawfully have more of a right to a job lynch replied the right and the obligation to work is one thats shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here sessions quickly issued a news release to highlight that response under later questioning by democratic sen chuck schumer of new york lynch clarified it stating there is no right to work for an immigrant who has no lawful status 
this was disturbing and telling clearly ms lynchs views on immigration and likely therefore on other issues are malleable and subject to revision if modifying her position is consistent with her personal goals 
as attorney general lynch directs the operations of the entire justice department and all those who work for that department ms lynch must understand true democracy can only exist when justice is blind and totally objective 
however lynch and the others who have fallen under hillary clintons corrupt sphere of influence are trapped in hillarys web of deception having fallen victim to the hillary virus throughout clintons many decades in american politics this highly contagious and virulent malady has proven to be virtually ineradicable it is not likely to change no matter the outcome of the next election",2016-11-04

remember when hillary clinton was insisting that there was no fbi investigation of her just a security review even when the fbi rejected that claim 
well andrea mitchell nbcs own baghdad bob isnt giving up that claim so easily even while the rest of the clinton clique is screeching against the fbi for investigating hillary like bats from the nether regions of leftwing hell mitchell is sticking to the old spin there is no fbi investigation of hillary  close your eyes and say it three times the fbi is not investigating hillary its not its not 
in a complete state of denial on thursday msnbc host andrea mitchell interrupted live coverage of donald trump speaking at a florida campaign rally to supposedly factcheck the candidate for citing a bombshell report that the fbi was conducting an extensive investigation into hillary clintons email and charitable foundation scandals 
mitchell refused to accept reality just a lot of factchecking to do shes not under criminal investigation in fact its not an investigation its just a review of the emails she did not lie to the fbi according to james comey there was no grounds to prosecute her so there are no lies theres no criminality she fretted i dont know even where to startbut i mean we have to put it in some context 
the context is that defending hillary clinton has become a mental illness 
but as i wrote earlier this week fact checking has become a media term for insisting on the primacy of its alternate reality even when it flies in the face of actual reality there is no fbi investigation of hillary anyone who believes that is probably some sort of rightwinger who listens to what the fbi actually says rather than what nbc says that the fbi says",2016-11-04
274,clintons web of deception,"muslims terrorize hindus because its wednesday november   daniel greenfield 
the official media narrative is that muslims are the worlds greatest victims the truth especially in majority muslim countries is rather strikingly different  
crowds of muslims attacked hindu homes and temples in eastern bangladesh this week raising concerns that the authorities are not taking steps to curb rising religious tensions 
attacks on hindus are not unusual in bangladesh but it is rare to see multiple crowds targeting temples in an organized way as they did on sunday and monday 
note the casual language of the times muslim religious violence is commonplace in bangladesh its just not common for it to be happening on this scale 
but how could it be otherwise islam is structurally xenophobic violently bigoted and racist down to its origins islams faith is expressed in a violent campaign against nonmuslims this is jihad 
muslims attacking hindus christians jews yazidis or any other group that just means it must be wednesday or any other day of the week 
on sunday hundreds of muslims entered a hindu neighborhood where they ransacked  temples and the homes of more than  families mr deb said he said that the mob used long hard sticks and locally made sharp weapons to assault hindus they found there and that at least  people including a priest were wounded

dont look now but pardonher talk is growing 
just as the clinton campaign and its media allies rage against the fbi some are looking for a pardon solution and a way to spin that pardon as something other than a straight admission of guilt how about political reconciliation and a way to defy those mean republicans and take the issue of all the crimes that hillary committed off the table here you go 
it does not take much clairvoyance to predict that clintons most strident opponents may seek to extend the use criminal investigations as a political tactic to undermine her presidency if she wins the election next week that prospect triggers a startling idea should president barack obamasimply pardon clinton if she wins the election 
a presidential pardon could short circuit some of this maneuvering the constitution gives the president the power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the united states and it could be used here the public is aware of the allegations against clinton yet she has continued to lead in election polls if voters choose her for the presidency their decision that the allegations are not disqualifying deserves respect a presidential pardon could ratify that assessment 
yes but what should obama pardon hillary clinton for corruption bribery abuse of classified information how about everything lets just print up a list of every possible crime and pardon hillary for all of them it would save time energy and raise hillary above the law it would be a clear statement that she could get away with murder

former defense minister of canada paul hellyer has filed a lawsuit along with several others at the state canada on the ceta treaty ceta stands for comprehensive economic and trade agreement a trade which are entered according to prosecutors constitutional and international rights of people with feet paul hellyer called the treaty therefore comprehensive trade and takeover agreement with this convention which comes out of the hat of the international bankers  families will obtain control over almost the entire world constitutions of member countries will no longer apply only the will of the  families the elite will apply 
the lawsuit was officially filed on october  of this year and actually consists of four 
namely separate indictments the federal government does not have the constitutional authority to sign execute and implement treaties without the express prior authority of parliament through an act of parliament 
the federal government has no constitutional right to sign ceta and  or perform without having this treaty first by the parliament through official channels  the solid majority of the ceta articles and their impact encroach on exclusive provincial spheres or forumprotected by the division of powers under the constitution act  
most of the ceta provisions and their impact undermine exclusive legal rights protected by the canadian constitutional law  the ceta gouge and extinguishes the constitutionally protected judiciary in canada by creating foreign tribunals to determining property and legal issues in canada without any judicial oversight or jurisdiction of the canadian courts over the disputes and 
ceta removes the constitutional legal system by setting foreign tribunals have to judge between property and other legal issues without overlooked may be the canadian legal system and various articles of the ceta violate constitutional enshrined rights in the charter of rights and freedoms  and overrides charter guarantees that ground canadas ability to mount public programs on health education social services and public utilitiesincluding the elimination of subsidies monopolies and state enterprises for public welfare in short the treaty places the rights of private foreign investors about those of the canadian constitution and canadian citizens 
various provisions of ceta violated constitutional builtrights enshrined in the document charter of rights and freedoms and transcend guaranteed rights that canada has the opportunity to develop public programs in the fields of health education social services and public funds including the termination of subsidies  monopolies and state enterprises for the public interest in short the treaty puts the interests of private foreign companies over those of the canadian constitution and its inhabitants 
but this is not all paul hellyer which is so you can immediately see and hear his call to canadians and the rest of the world his mind has put on the roll of the largest crime syndicate has ever known the world the international bankers international intertwined the main industries in which the owners of the revenues come from only  families 
paul hellyer remembers the canada which was separate from the bankers yet not so long ago until  the canadian government expressed its money itself there was no such thing as inflation poverty and debt canada was one of the largest financiers behind the allies that europe was liberated from the germans at that time life was good cheap and everyone had enough money to do the things they wanted to do from one day to the issued money creation in  the central banks and money was no longer free within a few years canada had a huge debt that is recovered just as us on the civilian population through numerous taxes paul hellyer has evidence that this happened in unconstitutional manner and wants to decide turn back to canada to give it right back himself pressing her money to spend this affects every canadian citizen a large sum of money to free education health housing etc can be paid without causing debts paul hellyer does the same as foundation for our money aims but in a turbo version he lets no grass grow does not perform educational skits for the people who maintain this crime for years paul hellyer goes straight for the scapegoat 
now the video of paul hellyer where he explains personally exactly what is going on and how they want to approach this 
dear readers this could be the big break this information should be shared very broadly as to all countries under the thumb are the bankers the same applies we can deliver all of this unfair system where our benefit only a handful of people the power over the creation of money is a sovereign matter since no one has more to do with it we want a better and fairer world then this is the opportunity that everyone has been waiting for 
privatized money is the reason for all wars privatized money is the cause of poverty oppression exploitation neglect of our elderly and less fortunate privatized money is the root of all evil on this beautiful planet now is the chance to get out from under the yoke to stand up for the future of ourselves and our children now is the chance to rid the world of those people who make a huge mess for over  years with one goal to keep the creation of money in their hands and with it the power over almost anything this planet has to offer

even though early polling shows there hasnt been an impact in swing states  and even though the majority of americans have already made up their minds each time her emails are brought up hillary clinton falls in the polls 
a gallup poll showed that emails are the most americans have heard about clinton not that she is the most qualified candidate in modern history or how her policy on paid family leave might impact them  but the emails that she was already cleared on 
even though one result of the comey letter has been to energize clinton supporters  at a time when she was facing a likely win that can create complacency this still isnt an acceptable practice 
republican fbi director james comey finds himself in the hot seat today after sending a letter that has no precedent obviously would impact an election that was then just  days out and is now  days out and actually bore no information well thats inaccurate the letter bore inaccurate smoke and innuendo that has already been cleared but the damage has already been done 
while ron fournier and others suggested that democratic objections to this unprecedented violation of the rules by comey was just more partisan folly the truth is even more disturbing 
by even suggesting that objecting to violating a longstanding rule is partisan we are allowing the press to enable republicans to continue pretending there is no reality 
in reality no matter which side of the aisle you are on its a rule not to comment on ongoing investigations that could impact an election the reasons for this are obvious and the potential ramifications for abuse are terrifying for both parties  for instance its obvious that the fbi is investigating the trump campaign for coordination with russia but we dont headline that because the fbi hasnt commented on that because 
to do so would violate the rule not to interfere with elections 
so its really quite frightening to hear people claim objecting to violating this rule is partisan even as the trump campaign is benefiting from the adherence to said rule if the rule applies to donald trump it should apply to hillary clinton 
asking that this value be applied to both sides is not partisan 
we must stick to reality we must not allow our need to appear objective cause us to fall so far down the rabbit hole that we enable republicans to keep drinking the nofact koolaid 
the press did the republican smoke is a real fire thing all through president obamas terms at one point claiming he was implicated in benghazi emails because a reporter allowed a republican aide to read him said emails  and of course it turned out that the emails didnt say what the aide told the reporter but that was learned much later and as everyone knows a lie travels faster than the truth 
and now american voters in swing states who read papers will think the fbi is investigating clinton 
so comeys letter did damage hillary clinton even if she wins the election the letter damaged her and down ballot democrats 
the media never learns they take republican smoke and innuendo and treat it as fact every time they look like fools to those who know there was no there in the comey letter but the average voter doesnt live for political updates

podesta said theres no evidence of wrongdoing no charge of wrongdoing he said if all the media reports are true about the investigation having nothing to do with hillary clinton its hard to see how this amounts to anything

clinton campaign manager robbie mook said that the comey letter is motivating clinton volunteers and supporters

they are turning out not only to have her back but to rally our supporters to turn out and vote as early voting goes into full swing were not just seeing this in our offices on the ground but also in our online in the online space as well i think this is we already had momentum and wind behind our back going into yesterday i think that this has only increased the momentum that were feeling among our activists on the ground 
later mook suggested that the comey letter is helping the clinton campaign by adding fuel to their early voting fire it is likely that the comey letter will backfire on republicans and motivate democrats to get out and support their nominee 
an early report from a pollster in two swing states saw no impact from the letter on voters hillary clinton may end up benefiting from comeys actions because the fbi director might have gotten rid of the one thing that could have beaten her 
with one written paragraph james comey may have destroyed democratic complacency",2016-11-23
279,trump throws a fit when asked why he is promoting his hotel instead of campaigning,"by sarah jones on sat oct th  at  pm donald trump uses sexual shaming and humiliation of women as simplistic revenge for the slightest felt spurn a newly surfaced video via ryan grim shows the trump humiliation game in action which i walk everyone through from the pov of the woman share on twitter print this post 
if youre a woman whos worked in any business where youre forced to try to appease the massively sensitive ego of a sexually aggressive vulgar man in power you will know exactly whats about to happen in this video 
donald trump uses sexual shaming and humiliation of women as simplistic revenge for the slightest felt spurn and theres a newly surfaced video via ryan grim at huffington post that shows the trump humiliation game in action 
in the video trump publicly sexualizes and shames the  miss universe winner from australia jennifer hawkins as revenge before he does it trump tells the audience get even with people if they screw you screw them back  times as hard i really believe that 
watch this newly surfaced  corporate speech here via huffington post major trigger warning if youve been there 
watching this you see the trump modus operandi in action this is the sting felt by numerous women who report spurning trumps advances the harassment as revenge the sexual shaming 
trump sets the audience up for the roman gladiator moment of public sexual offering by priming them with his belief that you should screw people back if they screw you the sexually angry verb foreshadows whats to come because he is going to screw jennifer hawkins in public when she realizes that because its public she cant further humiliate him by saying no or objecting without facing huge repercussions 
trump says hes going to give them an example of his revenge theory jennifer hawkins 
trump orders hawkins to the stage the audience cheers and jeers delighting in the upcoming shaming of the beautiful girl its to be a public spanking so much fun 
first of all how beautiful is jennifer trump asks claiming ownership of jennifer as an object while playing magnanimous daddy who dishes out praise and approval before the spanking the message he can make or break her she better play nice 
warning shot this is about getting even 
trump tells the audience that he was mad at hawkins because she allegedly dissed him by declining to introduce him at the event in sydney he tells the audience how mad he was and then says as shes crossing the stage shes my favorite miss universe so she thinks maybe this isnt going to be as bad as she fears 
but then he stabs her publicly for the first time but i think i like the new one better 
the audience loves it he is going to feed them the sexual humiliation of a beautiful woman because she wasnt a good girl she reaches him and they clasp hands while she smiles through the shame knowing she has no choice and wanting to be a good sport 
hawkins tries to make light of the situation while appeasing trump playing along with his game because she has to but there will be no easy way out of this one it wont be enough to fawn over him in front of the audience she will have to pay 
i was actually going to get up and tell you that jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside but shes not very bright trump tells the audience signaling that hawkins is a piece of meat to be dissected by him publicly for her refusal to give him anything he asks for 
that wouldnt have been true but i would have said it anyway trump proudly tells the audience this is his alpha male routine except in real life the alpha male doesnt have to abuse money and power he inherited in order to win the girl but in the mind of little men like trump this makes him a winner 
trump points out that hawkins is a big star now but he helped her make it and then dissed him he owns her she must comply or face his wrath hawkins tries to say that she did introduce him but trump pushes her away from the microphone this public shaming will be done from trumps pov only no need for hawkins to assert her personhoodthere will be no defense allowed because shes already guilty 
and you know what she came tonight she came  came she came she came trump says gleefully like the drunk pervy uncle everyone tries to avoid at christmas he waits for the audience to join him in his sexual shaming and they do they get it hee heee so clever came knuckles dragging on the floor clever 
see so they have the same filthy minds in australia trump says 
trump grabs hawkins around the waist and forces a kiss on her just like he bragged about doing on the bush tape 
hawkins reflexively turns away and puts her arm between them the kiss misses its mark and lands on her cheek she is hoping this is good enough humiliation for him but putting her foot down on actual mouth contact shes allowed herself to be publicly humiliated to appease him and pretended to fawn over him as required but she will not cannot allow the kiss the repulsive kiss 
im telling this story as i imagine it to be from her point of view although she has refused to comment of course she refused to comment women are told they will be blackballed if they comment the world is full of men like trump and they stick together see roger ailes women have to play along and appease and if that doesnt work they have to allow themselves to be sexually assaulted and humiliated just a little bit in public especially if they said no in private 
i can only do this because i have lived it somewhat like this in public and i have tried to appease the ego of the assaulter in order to keep my job while denying him his assumed entitlement to my body 
from talking to so many women during this election i know that im not alone i know that many other women will watch this and know they will feel the creep of fear and revulsion the deer in the headlights cringe that takes over when you know that you are about to be humiliated as a sexual object because you refused him or refused to appease the ego of the powerful man in charge by behaving like a sexual conquest how dare hawkins have her own life and be unwilling to change all of her plans in order to introduce trump 
and other people will watch this humiliation and enjoy it setting you up to be humiliated even more they will laugh about it and gossip about it which is the social punishment women face when they reject a man like trump ironically if you give in youre not humiliated its only if you say no that you are set up to be publicly flogged as a sex object 
its not just the unwanted kiss although that is disgusting and assault much like donald trump bragged about doing on the billy bush bus tape its the public humiliation and denigration 
its the way the woman is forced in front of thousands of people to try to smile her way through his ambush of verbal and physical assaults as he takes revenge 
its the way she tries to make it okay to sweetsmooth his ego in order to get out of the line of fire and in return he shames her by suggesting he made her come and then grabs her for an unwanted kiss 
if there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the trump candidacy perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people and that this kind of thing is horrific but its not all trumps fault its the cultures fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman 
in fact this is shades of what trump did to hillary clinton in the stalking debate after which he announced that looking at her from behind he was not impressed

280,clinton isnt letting up as she hammers trump for pimping his hotel instead of campaigning,"a pollster who is in the field in two swing states is reporting that he is seeing no early impact from the fbi reviewing new emails in the hillary clinton investigation in two swing states 
geoff garin of hart research tweeted from the field still early but i was in the field in two states last night and saw absolutely no impact from the reporting on the comey letter 
 geoff garin geoffgarin october   
it is still early but if this were the election shifting news that republicans were hoping for the impact would have been immediate the reality is that if the public opinion polls tighten in the final days of the campaign it will be because republicans are coming back to trump 
there are few undecided voters in this election and even if all the republican base come home to trump it wont be enough for trump to win because he is losing where the presidential election is really held trump is getting crushed at the state level 
republicans have been trying to build hillary clintons emails into a story for years and they have failed at every turn 
hillary clinton led the election while under congressional investigation hillary clinton led the election while under fbi investigation hillary clinton is leading the election today the message that republicans and the media dont want to hear is that voters are sick of the emails and they dont care 
voters are smarter than republicans and the press give them credit for the hillary clinton email scandal has never broken out of the right wing bubble because there is no evidence that clinton did anything wrong 
if the polls tighten a little this will be the best news in the world for hillary clinton and democrats because it will destroy any potential for democratic complacency and get their voters out and to the polls 
what geoff garin witnessed is probably going to end up being very accurate james comeys letter to congress is unlikely to move swing states and change the outcome of the presidential election",2016-10-26
281,three new polls shatter the myth that the presidential election is tightening,"share on twitter print this post 
the fbi is examining how a hillary clinton aide handled emails the examination has nothing to do with the democratic nominee her emails or her email server 
according to newsweeks kurt eichenwald the scandal is related to the process clinton aide huma abedin used to print out emails for the then secretary of state to read 
eichenwald reported because clinton preferred to read documents on paper rather than on a screen emails and other files were often printed out and provided to her either at her office or home where they were delivered in a diplomatic pouch by a security agent abedin like many state department officials found the government network technology to be cumbersome and she had great trouble printing documents there investigative records show as a result she sometimes transferred emails from her unclassified state department account to either her yahoo account or her account on clintons server and printed the emails from there it is not clear whether she ever transferred official emails to the account she used for her husbands campaign 
abedin would use this procedure for printing documents when she received emails she believed clinton needed to see and when the secretary forwarded emails to her for printing abedin told the fbi she would often print these emails without reading them abedin printed a large number of emails this way in part because investigative records show other staff members considered her clintons gatekeeper and often sent abedin electronic communications they wanted the secretary to see 
the entire scandal is about how emails were printed it has nothing to do with how hillary clinton handled emails or classified information the investigation is related to how an aide printed emails for hillary clinton to read no wonder comey didnt provide more details in his letter to congress the details of what is being examined are an embarrassment to the fbi 
there is no evidence that clintons aide committed a crime for the printing of the emails to be deemed criminal there must be evidence that abedin intended to leak classified information there remains zero evidence of criminal activity 
the fbi examination of new emails is turning out to be one of the most overblown red herrings of the  election  and comeys behavior is a disgrace to the us intelligence community 
the new information destroys republican hopes that the new emails were the game changer that could save them from defeat  republicans may spend the remaining days pushing the emails but their behavior will be the hallmark of a desperate party that is facing a crushing defeat 
the emails wont change anything in  but they will give congressional republicans a reason to keep investigating hillary clinton in  and beyond in other words james comey is already delegitimizing hillary clintons potential presidency",2016-10-26
282,former gop congressman goes full trump encourages armed revolt if clinton wins,"trump warned his supporters that the us postal service is trying to steal the election for hillary clinton in colorado 
video 
at a rally in golden co trump said 
i have real problems with ballots being sent does that make sense 
like people saying oh heres a ballot heres another ballot throw it away oh heres one i like well keep that one 
i have real problems so get your ballots in 
trump also accused election officials of throwing away ballots as his rally was a mixture of claims of voter fraud and baseless speculation about hillary clintons emails 
donald trump appears to be losing his mind he also seems to think that accusing the us postal service and election officials of stealing the election for hillary clinton is going to motivate republicans to vote 
consider the contradiction in trumps message the republican nominee tells his supporters that the us postal service is throwing away ballots while at the same time he is urging them to mail in their ballots 
if their ballots are going to be thrown away by usps why should republicans bother mailing their ballots in 
it is this sort of incoherent gibberish that makes no sense trumps inability to stay disciplined and on message is also one of the biggest reasons why republicans on pace to lose this election

283,conservatives already plotting to block clintons scotus picks let court die out,"by rmuse on sat oct th  at  pm he is taking the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throwing them back in republicans faces   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
although this campaign season has been interesting to say the least there is something happening one never thought would occur after spending nearly eight years demonizing obstructing and criticizing every and anything about the president of the united states republicans desperate to save their jobs are beginning to tout their  imagined  close ties to the democratic president whose approval rating and popularity are growing 
it is hypocritical to say the least and at some point a result of a toxic republican candidate for the presidency but for some gop candidates it is a very dangerous strategy if any republican believed president obama would allow them to take advantage of him after spending eight years assailing him as illegitimate and corrupt they were sadly mistaken and underestimated the commander in chiefs tolerance during an election 
the president is using the final two weeks before the election to decimate republicans for either  belated rejection  or continued support of donald trump president obama is also reminding republicans that  donald trump is the endpoint of eight years of gop toxic hostility  it may be a tad of an exaggeration to claim that  obama seems determined to spend the last two weeks of the election laying waste to every republican who ever crossed him  but he is getting some wellplaced and wellwarranted shots at republicans 
two republican hypocrites hoping to take advantage of the presidents approval ratings have been some of his harshest critics so it likely stunned the president that they are boasting working closely with the man they obstructed opposed and attempted to get rid of 
ohio senator rob portman had the temerity to run a campaign ad boasting about working closely with the president to break the grip of heroin addiction president obama took the time to excoriate portman for 
 finally withdrawing his support from donald trump  but only  after looking at the polling now that its politically expedient but he has supported him up until last week so i guess it was ok when trump was attacking minorities and suggesting that mexicans were rapists  and insulting gold star moms making fun of disabled americans i guess that didnt quite tip it over the edge why was that ok and now he says he will vote for the vicepresidential nominee instead except that guy still supports donald trump  
the president was a little more exercised after learning that the man who called the president  one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times california republican representative daryl issa is sending out campaign mailers with the presidents face on them and boasting about his close work with president obama  to protect victims of sexual assault  
daryl issa is in a fairly competitive race compared to past elections and he certainly has earned the presidents wrath after obstructing progress and wasting taxpayer money on issacreated scandals during a fundraiser in la jolla california sunday last the president assailed issa for having the audacity to use a campaign mailer with the presidents image on it the president said 
 issas primary contribution to the united states congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumpedup investigations that have led nowhere this is now a guy who because poll numbers are bad has sent out brochures with my picture on them touting his cooperation on issues with me now that is the definition of chutzpah 
as remarked by tim murphy at mother jones president obama is not just evening up the score with republicans who made his tenure miserable  he is attempting to have the last word on the personal and political fights of the last eight yearsto take the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throw them back in republicans faces  
the president clearly has a lot of  words  to harangue republicans with he said  
 heres the thing for years republican politicians and the farright media outlets have pumped up all kinds of crazy stuff about me about hillary about harry they said i wasnt born here they said climate change is a hoax they said that i was going to take everybodys guns away they said that while we were doing military exercises that weve been doing forever suddenly this was a plot to impose martial law this is what theyve been saying for years now so people have been hearing it they start thinking well maybe its true and if the world theyve been seeing is im powerful enough to cause hurricanes on my own and to steal everybodys guns in the middle of the night and impose martial laweven though i cant talk without a prompterthen is it any wonder that they end up nominating somebody like donald trump 
and the fact is that there are a lot of politicians who knew better there are a lot of senators who knew better but they went along with these stories because they figured you know what thisll help rile up the base itll give us an excuse to obstruct what were trying to do we wont be able to appoint judges well gum up the works well create gridlock itll give us a political advantage so they just stood by and said nothing and their base began to actually believe this stuff so donald trump did not start this donald trump didnt start it he just did what he always did which is slap his name on it take credit for it and promote it thats what he always does and so now when suddenly its not working and people are saying wow this guys kind of out of line all of a sudden these republican politicians who were okay with all this crazy stuff up to a point suddenly theyre all walking away oh this is too much so when you finally get him on tape bragging about actions that qualify as sexual assault and his poll numbers go down suddenly thats a dealbreaker well what took you so long what the heck what took you so long all these years 
the mother jones piece made out like president obama is seeking retribution or  revenge  against republicans for their impropriety as legislators over the past eight years without knowing what goes on in the presidents head to motivate his campaign rhetoric that is a hard call to make with any surety barack obama does not strike one as being vindictive 
the president is though an accomplished campaigner and as his tenure in the white house is winding down and republicans are struggling to find an identity apart from donald trump it is prudent of the president to remind voters exactly what republicans are about and what they are about is precisely why donald trump is their standard bearer and why republicans are hypocrites for both abandoning trump and embracing the man they obstructed and tried to remove from the white house",2016-10-27
284,the media is getting desperate and pushing a bogus trump comeback story,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on sat oct th  at  pm you do know you just attacked a gold star family one adviser warned trump whats that he asked share on twitter print this post 
gabriel sherman writes at new york mag that when donald trump attacked the khan family over khizr khans speech at the democratic national convention he had no idea what a gold star family was 
you will remember that khizr khan stood up in front of the entire world and said to donald trump let me ask you have you even read the united states consitution i will gladly lend you my copy in this document look for the words liberty and equal protection of the law 
the fallout was predictable donald trump openly criticized lost it he attacked the khans religious beliefs saying if you look at his wife she was standing there she had nothing to say she probably maybe she wasnt allowed to have anything to say 
now it turns out that he had no idea what he was doing because he is ignorant and because as mark cuban has observed he isnt interested in learning anything gabriel sherman explains 
you do know you just attacked a gold star family one adviser warned trump trump didnt know what a gold star family was whats that he asked to trump khizr khan and his wife ghazala were enemies who had said something mean about him just like rosie odonnell and any number of people who had gotten under his skin over the years wasnt it his right to respond ?the election is about the american people its not about you? manafort told trump according to a person briefed on the conversation trump countered with breitbarts report on khans purported belief in sharia ?hes not running for president? manafort shot back ?the clintons did this to us to waste our time getting off message? 
of course trump could not and would not admit his own ignorance and he certainly wasnt prepared to take the blame instead as sherman reveals he took it out on manafort in front of his senior advisors including ailes according to trump manafort wasnt able to get the media to focus on the right stuff 
no wonder when trump refuses to take manaforts advice and focus on the right stuff this is not to defend manafort who is at least as despicable as his boss but it serves as an example of how trumps first reaction each and every time is to get back at his critic 
it was one of donald trumps most visible joe mccarthy moments and his response to khizr khan actually reinforced the point khan was trying to make 
stopping and thinking are foreign to him and if you are not astonished by the appalling ignorance on display here you should not be this is all in keeping with a party that prides itself on ignorance rather than facts",2016-10-27
285,trump kicks africanamerican protester out of north carolina rally calls him a thug,"by rmuse    pm if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half i think its going to be just catastrophic   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
it may be the understatement of the year to say the republican party is on the verge of a fullon civil war and it may be obvious to many americans that the blame for the interparty discord is its standard bearer donald j trump however much trumps candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of trumps reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellionminded trump supporters the real instigators are the koch brothers 
although the oil magnates were never on the trump bandwagon they are responsible for the trump loyalists within the gop who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nations political system and indeed the workings of government itself the tea party caucus an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former house speaker john a boehner out of congress morphed into the inaptly named freedom caucus that has embraced trump are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isnt solely to put current speaker paul ryan out of a job although that is high on the trump supporters todo list 
as noted in wednesdays new york times  mr trumps supporters said they were determined to harness the antiestablishment energy that mr trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the republican leadership in congress  a target many of them seemeager to take down  
the rightwing extremist that actually  took down  former house majority leader eric cantor conservative extremist and house freedom caucus member david brat issued a warning to establishment republicans 
 theres a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to dc leadership comes and smacks our guy thats where youre going to put down a marker really and the american people are just scratching their head saying really thats rich  
brat has been a thorn in the establishments side since paul ryan became speaker and he joins a dangerous number of  real conservatives  who cannot understand or comport with ryan and establishment leaders who dared criticize trump instead of using their majority advantage to go after hillary clinton 
donald trump and a few of his  senior aides  are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending trump in fact besides assailing ryan for not sticking by trump it is reported that trump said privately that ryan should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the trump candidacy and during an interview with reuters he complained that  the people are very angry with the leadership of this party because this is an election that we will win  percent if we had support from the top  win or lose there is going to be a major bloodletting after the election and the establishment although powerful may face a herculean task to save the party 
this impending conflict within the gop has been brewing longer than donald trump has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced antiestablishment devotee to run his campaign the chairman of breitbart news stephen bannon had made it one of his primary goals to get paul ryan out as house speaker because he is not a true conservative intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uberconservative paradise and uberconservative is just a different way of saying a  nongovernment  according to the koch brothers vision of american libertarianism dont believe it 
two groups closely aligned with the koch brothers heritage action for america and freedomworks  have been pushing republicans as a party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the partys decisions something establishment types are resisting 
over the past few days leaders of both koch groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next or new speaker of the house something typically occurring directly after the general election in november regardless the outcome 
according to the chief executive of heritage action michael needham there is going to be hell to pay for establishment republicans if they dont bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the kochs and heavily courted by donald trump mr needham said 
 if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half i think its going to be just catastrophe  
another conservative extremist house freedom caucus member and ardent donald trump supporter echoed needhams sentiment and said  you cant ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle  
the dilemma for republicans after the election no matter the outcome is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party that doesnt seem likely because if trump loses big or small the extremists will unleash whatever level of hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of trumps more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump if trump wins the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on november  it will not be the end of hostilities among republicans 
the republican party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the united states or shutting down the government as a show of anger after four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative and the past yearandahalf of incitement by donald trump the republican party faces a serious threat to its longterm survival it is a threat that began about six years ago when the koch brothers ushered in an age of extremist conservatives that donald trump took advantage of to seize control of the republican party",2016-10-27

daytona beach fla reuters  heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign democratic candidate hillary clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states 
jennifer lopez will headline a free concert for clinton supporters in miami on saturday giving the former secretary of state a chance to connect with the key demographic of millennials she has sometimes struggled to reach  and some visual counterprogramming to the latest email controversy to roil her race for the white house 
the federal bureau of investigation said on friday it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into clintons use of a private email system  a latebreaking surprise that will likely continue to get extensive media play leading up to the nov  vote 
celebritydriven events like the concert can serve as a bit of a distraction from the controversy said eric kasper a political scientist at the university of wisconsineau claire 
it is a way to kind of take the edge off things because it tends to be more positive kasper said 
the jlo concert is the first in a series next week clinton will take the stage with jay z in cleveland and then with katy perry in philadelphia on nov  
a harvard university poll this week showed that among likely voters aged  to  clinton is leading republican rival donald trump a celebrity in his own right who starred in the reality television show the apprentice 
but turnout is a concern the exceptionally negative tone of this years race for the white house has soured young americans on politics reutersipsos polling shows 
presidential candidates have long sought to create buzz with help from celebrity pals said tevi troy who chronicled the strategy in his book what jefferson read ike watched and obama tweeted  years of pop culture in the white house 
campaigns do it to reach out to people who are not necessarily interested in politics but are interested in pop culture said troy a presidential historian who worked in the george w bush white house 
the events are like a larger version of a campaign yard sign a way to show a groundswell of support behind a candidate  and a way to appeal to fans of the musicians said kasper who has studied the intersection between pop culture and politics 
it can create a kind of psychological connection that we otherwise might not have when a politician endorses a presidential candidate for instance kasper said

287,trump has gotten the republican party sued for trying to intimidate voters,"by reuters    pm democrat hillary clintons top aides on saturday lashed out at fbi director james comey for igniting a new controversy over a longrunning private email investigation less than two weeks before the presidential election saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing and accusing him of spreading innuendo   
by roberta rampton and steve holland 
daytona beach flagolden colo reuters  democrat hillary clintons top aides on saturday lashed out at fbi director james comey for igniting a new controversy over a longrunning private email investigation less than two weeks before the presidential election saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing and accusing him of spreading innuendo 
comey who has headed the federal bureau of investigation since  notified the us congress on friday that the agency is again reviewing emails even though in july it decided not to seek prosecution of clinton for her handling of classified materials on a private email server while she was secretary of state 
john podesta who heads clintons presidential campaign told reporters that comeys letter to congress was light on facts heavy on innuendo and he urged comey to come forward and give those answers to the american public about the exact nature of the fbis latest review of emails 
sources close to the investigation on friday said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe into anthony weiner the estranged husband of top clinton aide huma abedin 
weiner a former us congressman from new york is the target of an fbi investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a yearold girl in north carolina 
with the nov  elections quickly approaching republican presidential candidate donald trump pounded away at the new fbi development devoting a large part of a campaign speech in golden colorado to attacking clinton and arguing that she is not to be trusted with the presidency 
her criminal action was willful deliberate intentional and purposeful trump said standing in front of hay bales stacked in a horse barn hillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her illegal actions from public disclosure and exposure 
comey however has not provided any details on whether the emails now under review are being seen for the first time by the fbi or the nature of their contents 
clintons campaign tried to play down the new review theres no evidence of wrongdoing no charge of wrongdoing podesta said in the fbis latest announcement that it was taking appropriate investigative steps after learning of emails that appear to be pertinent to the earlier probe 
clinton campaign manager robby mook trying to tamp down speculation of a voter backlash this late in the campaign said americans had already factored what they knew about the email investigation into how they would cast their ballots 
we dont see it changing the landscape for undecided voters mook said 
clinton aides also said this latest controversy has further energized her supporters 
clinton was campaigning in florida on saturday a battleground state that many analysts say trump must win in order to have any chance of being elected 
in recent weeks trump has been running behind clinton in most public opinion polls 
justice department officials according to a source who asked not to be identified were opposed to the fbi directors letter being sent to congress and believe his actions conflict with a justice department memo outlining instructions that agencies should not to act in ways that could influence elections 
while attorney general loretta lynch did not discuss the matter directly with comey the source said aides were in touch with each other 
comey let it be known he felt he had to send the letter as a followup to his congressional testimony earlier this year regarding the fbis probe of clintons emails the source said 
meanwhile clinton supporters rallied to her defense following fridays fbi disclosure 
the congressional black caucus comprised of about  members of the house of representatives nearly all democrats held a news conference in columbus ohio and urged comey to release more details

new york reuters  with  days to go before the us presidential election democratic nominee hillary clinton leads republican donald trump by  percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks according to the reutersipsos states of the nation project 
though data is not available for all early voting states clinton enjoys an edge in swing states such as ohio and arizona and in republican party strongholds such as georgia and texas 
an estimated  million americans have voted so far in the election according to the university of floridas united states election project accounting for as much as  percent of the electorate 
overall clinton remained on track to win a majority of votes in the electoral college the reutersipsos survey showed 
having so many ballots locked down before the nov  election is good news for the clinton campaign on friday the federal bureau of investigation announced that it is examining newly discovered emails belonging to clintons close aide huma abedin those emails were found on a computer belonging to anthony weiner abedins estranged husband during an unrelated investigation into illicit messages he is alleged to have sent to a teenage girl the reutersipsos survey was conducted before the news emerged friday afternoon 
it remains unclear whether the fbi inquiry will upset the balance in the race the bureau disclosed nothing about the abedin emails including whether any of the messages were sent by or to clinton over the summer the fbi said it was closing its investigation into clintons use of a private email system while secretary of state until friday her campaign seemed to have weathered the initial fbi email probe 
clinton has held a lead averaging four to seven percentage points in polls in recent weeks as the trump campaign wrestled with accusations by women of groping and other sexual advances trump has said none of the accusations are true he also struggled in the recent presidential debates and faced questions about his taxes 
as of thursday clintons odds of receiving the  electoral college votes needed to win the presidency remained at greater than  percent according to state of the nation polling results released saturday the project estimated she would win by  votes to  with  votes solidly for the democrat 
clintons lead among early voters is similar to the lead enjoyed by president barack obama over republican mitt romney at this point of the  race according to a reutersipsos poll taken at the time obama won the election by  electoral votes to romneys  
but even before the latest email news it had been a difficult week for clinton news coverage of trumps accusers had diminished while clinton confronted the almost daily release by wikileaks of emails purportedly hacked from her campaign managers account this weeks leaked messages raised questions about former president bill clintons finances 
and her lead in the states of the nation project fell slightly from last week though the projected electoral college votes hardly moved the number of states solidly for clinton slid from  to  this week trump didnt see any additional states tilt solidly to him but he did see some gains the swing states of pennsylvania colorado iowa and nevada all moved from leaning to clinton to being too close to call 
still trumps path to a victory is narrow and any realistic chance rests on his winning ohio north carolina and florida as of thursday ohio remained a tossup florida and north carolina were still tilting toward clinton according to the states of the nation results 
early voting data for florida and north carolina was not yet available this week in ohio clinton led trump by double digits among early voters the projects broader polling suggests the state is deadlocked between the two candidates 
in arizona clinton also was solidly ahead among early voters in the past month arizona has gradually moved from a solid trump state to a marginal clinton state although it is still too close to call according to the project results 
in georgia she enjoyed a similar lead among early voters overall georgia leans to trump but his lead narrowed to five percentage points this week down from eights points last week and  points a month ago 
even in texas where trump enjoys a sizable lead clinton has a doubledigit edge among early voters according to project results

289,the media ignores the good news on climate change,"by hrafnkell haraldsson    pm trump sat on the stage looking for all the world like an honored donor to the cause and then got up and left without leaving a donation   
not only is donald trump a liar and a thinskinned crybaby but he is selfish never spending his own money when he can spend somebody elses this behavior was never more in evidence than the washington post s david fahrentholds account of a  a ribboncutting held by the association to benefit children for a nursery school when donald trump showed up sat down to appear to be a great supporter and then left without leaving a donation 
as sopan deb tweeted  
 sopan deb sopandeb october   
frank and kathie lee gifford were big donors and it is no wonder gifford was so shocked by trumps presence what had been exposed is that trumps life is a sham a gigantic show put on by him in which he parades through life pretending to be something he is not 
as fahrenthold explains  
for as long as he has been rich and famous donald trump has also wanted people to believe he is generous he spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public  even nationally televised  promises to give his own money away it was in large part a facade a monthslong investigation by the washington post has not been able to verify many of trumps boasts about his philanthropy 
that philanthropist isnt the real trump the only person trump visibly cares about is donald trump he uses his foundation to buy himself nice things spending other peoples money for luxury items and collectibles when he does make donations it is again because he gives no money to his own foundation with other peoples money 
fahrenthold says that the only donation of trumps own money the paper could find from the period of  to today is a  gift to the police athletic league of new york city in  
for a man as rich as trump claims to be  in eight years is nothing to brag about not that this stops the monumental deadbeat hypocrite that is donald trump from bragging anyway",2016-10-27
290,trump campaign admits they are trying to steal the election with voter suppression,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on sat oct th  at  pm that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released   
coming from people who believe in something called spiritual warfare a nebulous spiritual struggle taking place over and above all the talk about issues and policy positions  it is perhaps no surprise that the religious right should declare that their messiah  donald trump  is being threatened with witchcraft 
lance wallnau whose twitter page claims to be your spiritual warfare guide to the  election appeared on the jim bakker show to push the crazy idea that many christians feel this fog on their head at times and that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released 
watch courtesy of right wing watch 
oh sweet baby jesus the mighty lance has struck out what has happened of course is that the religious right not only endorsed but anointed a candidate who embodies the exact opposite of the values they claim to champion its no wonder they feel in a fog  metaphorically or physically theyre selling their souls 
wallnau claims the left is a smaller number of radicals better organized than the larger body of christ who doesnt work together and thats the dilemma that americas in right now even though the left is a disparate alliance of various groups working together and the religious right has been organizing since goldwater lost in   
a hypocrite just cant catch a break it seems 
the web literally is coming down on america and whats sad is how many christians feel this fog on their head at times do you feel that its almost like everythings going wrong we dont realize its a remnant operating strategically through organizations that are intent on shifting the american culture and discipling the country and that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released 
wherever theres agreement theres power the more unbelievers agree with the narrative that theyre hearing the more power and authorization satan has to manifest so unless the church has an exposure of what the enemys doing and begins to agree together with a counterstrategy were going to deal with more and more fog and the worst part iswe dont have to surrender nations to the devil 
so if you disagree with wallnau if you oppose trump it can only because youre manifesting the power of satan who in the old testament is gods lieutenant not his adversary so pick your testament i suppose 
lance wallnau insists he is not a big conspiracy theorist buff but this doesnt do anything to convince us hes not some wackadoodle instead this is nothing new as a nonchristian being told that you represent a devil you dont even believe exists 
there are  years of history backing up the accusation and testifying to its usefulness for religious zealots hoping to delegitimize or worse their opponents 
without charges of satanism and witchcraft you dont have the genocide of european and middle eastern paganism you dont have antijewish pogroms and you dont have the crusades or the spanish inquisition you dont have witchburnings 
what this sort of nonsense illustrates for liberals and progressives is that were not fighting on the same battleground as our opponents 
not only do they deal in a conspiracyladen world a world free of facts but a world in which what might be hiding under your bed or in your closet has real power and reason  and lets go ahead and say sanity  do not 
lets face it donald trumps biggest enemy is not satan but donald trump himself and wallnau can claim believers have an edge all they want but all the belief in the world wont overturn reality",2016-10-27
291,democrats may get a  for  special as trump defeat could take out paul ryan,"on meet the press clinton campaign manager robbie mook said that early voting is so strong for democrats in nevada that hillary clinton could build an insurmountable lead this week 
video 
chuck todd asked mook if he believed the email story could cost clinton the election 
he answered 
i dont think so look as i said we have over  volunteers out there were seeing record early voting numbers in north carolina florida look i would wager in nevada turnout is so strong among democrats there hillary could build an insurmountable lead in the coming days in nevada were feeling really good about this record turnout over  million people in our country now registered to vote fifty million of those are young people were just nose to the grindstone and were going to finish this out but people should not take anything for granted and were going to have to work hard to earn this 
hillary clinton could put nevada out of reach for trump this week but whether or not that happens is up to the voters if democrats continue to vote in overwhelming numbers in swing states the email story wont matter if democrats dont show up that is trumps only chance of winning 
the early voting numbers that hillary clinton is running up in florida north carolina and nevada are no accident clinton and the democratic party have invested heavily in an extensive get out the vote operation in early voting states 
democrats already had a strategic advantage in early voting before the  election but donal trumps refusal to invest in a substantial get out the vote operation has widened the gap between the two parties in this area 
the final week before the election could be just as vital to democrats in swing states as election day if hillary clinton piles up big margins in early voting it could leave minimal drama for election night 
the democratic early voting plan is working to perfection now as mook said all that is left is for democrats to put their heads down work hard and close the deal

292,with donald trump tanking a trump supporter waves her hillary in a noose doll at rally,"by jason easley on sun oct th  at  am republicans hoped that fbi director james comeys letter about new clinton related emails would swing the election for them but a new series of cbs news battleground polls shows clinton keeping her lead and within  points of trump in arizona share on twitter print this post 
the cbs news republicans hoped that fbi director james comeys letter about new clinton related emails would swing the election for them but a new series of cbs news battleground polls shows clinton keeping her lead and within  points of trump in arizona 
battleground tracker found that by a small margin comeys letter made democrats more likely net  to support clinton 
in the individual battleground states clinton leads by eight points in pennsylvania  north carolina  and in colorado  the only state of the four polled where trump has a small two point lead in arizona  
according to cbs news  and the larger demographic difference defining the race between clinton and donald trump has been a gender gap  slightly larger now than the last time in these states  that offsets a smaller movement of republicans to trump 
to put it another way hillary clintons support with women is going up at a larger rate than republican movement towards trump 
these are the first swing state polls to be taken since fbi director comey released his now infamous letter on friday the email story isnt moving voters it is reinforcing the partisanship of the election democrats are going to vote clinton republicans are going to vote for trump and there arent enough undecided voters to swing the election to trump 
republicans were hoping for a hail mary touchdown to save trump but clinton continues to lead in critical states with a little more than a week to go before election day if the comey letter is the big october surprise it isnt working on voters

293,number of accusers grows to  as former miss finland accuses trump of sexual assault,"by robert franek on sun oct th  at  am imagine if working to end rape culture were treated with the same attention as hillary clintons emails this is one fire that is burning strong and is a true threat to personal and public safety security and wellbeing share on twitter print this post 
the following post written by the rev robert a franek is a part of politicus policy discussion in which writers draw connections between real lives and public policy 
even after months and months of coverage blown out of proportion and at great expense to the public in dollars psychic stress and issue coverage it seems all one has to do is put hillary clinton and emails together in the same sentence with claims of lying and threatening national security and pandemonium continues to break loose throughout the mass media and social media worlds and yet despite multiple investigations and repeated explanations the pandemonium persists so much so that every time republicans stir up some smoke the media assumes there must be a blazing fire and sadly this is not going away anytime soon as republicans are promising more sham investigations in lieu of actually governing as sarah jones reported 
republicans are already planning how to avoid being grown ups who do their jobs if hillary clinton is elected president yes there will be more toythrowing and tantrums and best of all for the party of fiscal humiliations more wasteful spending on political witch hunts  sarah jones 
meanwhile women continue to come forward with painful heartbreaking stories of donald trumps sexual harassment and assault yet instead of being portrayed as survivors who have finally had enough of the republican presidential nominee and his lies and as women who have the strength and courage to go public with their stories they are being made into opportunistic victims and challenged for not coming forward sooner much sooner woefully no mention is made of the many intersecting reasons that lead many women and men not to report these crimes including that this is the only time when the victim is placed on trial 
after walking her readers through one incident of donald trumps public sexual humiliation of a woman for revenge  sarah jones makes the following observation 
if there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the trump candidacy perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people and that this kind of thing is horrific but its not all trumps fault its the cultures fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman 
she is right donald trump is despicable still there is cultural culpability in the perpetuation of rape culture where women are treated as objects forced into silence and placed on trial for their assailants crimes 
this must change 
it is unacceptable in a country that places such a high value on freedom that so many are not free from sexual harassment assault exploitation and humiliation more it is appalling that such behavior is often cheered unchallenged and dismissed it is also inexcusable that survivors face unparalleled levels of scrutiny when they do finally come forward 
it is also beyond tragic that people of faith who read the first chapter of genesis cant bear out the implications of men and women being created simultaneously and bearing equally the divine image 
supposed christian values champion and republican vice presidential nominee mike pence is more upset over an article he didnt read regarding voter suppression efforts by the trump campaign than any of the horrifying things donald trump has said including bragging about sexual assault 
these are not christian values nor are they values any civil society should hold failing to call out donald trumps abhorrent behavior and speech is beyond deplorable additionally supporting candidates like donald trump and mike pence gives validity to their wretched views and is especially shocking when done by people of faith and family values 
as a society we must challenge the pervasive and systemic sexism and misogyny that persists in our culture as much as we need changes in our laws and lawmakers at every level of government to reflect the equality and humanity of women we need a moral revival in our collective conscience as a nation that decries every facet of rape culture from how we raise our children to the victim blaming and shaming that happens each time a survivor goes public with their story 
imagine if working to end rape culture were treated with the same attention as hillary clintons emails this is one fire that is burning strong and is a true threat to personal and public safety security and wellbeing

294,trumps campaign backfires as hillary clinton attracts millions of new voters,"senate democrats arent playing around with fbi director james comey four top democrats sent comey and attorney general loretta lynch a letter demanding details on the emails that the fbi is investigating by monday in the letter sens carper leahy feinstein and cardin wrote 
senate democrats arent fooling around they want answers and they want them right now as more details become known fbi director comeys motives have come under criticism comey was advised by attorney general lynch not to send his letter until after the election but he sent it anyway 
comey worried to fbi employees that his letter would be misunderstood but he could have easily avoided any misunderstanding by either being specific in his letter or not sending the letter at all it is becoming difficult to look at comeys actions in an objective manner and not see partisan political motivations 
the fbi director has interfered in a presidential election with new emails that have nothing to do with the democratic nominee but can be used by her opponents for political purposes 
democrats are demanding answers and if james comey doesnt answer their questions by monday he will be forced to under oath if the democratic party wins a majority of seats in the senate

295,the dream team of hillary clinton and michelle obama fire democrats up in north carolina,"richard w painter wrote in a new york times an oped the fbis job is to investigate not to influence the outcome of an election 
such acts could also be prohibited under the hatch act which bars the use of an official position to influence an election that is why the fbi presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election the usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment 
and that is why on saturday i filed a complaint against the fbi with the office of special counsel which investigates hatch act violations and with the office of government ethics i have spent much of my career working on government ethics and lawyers ethics including two and a half years as the chief white house ethics lawyer for president george w bush and i never thought that the fbi could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations until this week 
this is the second complaint to be filed against fbi director comey the democratic coalition against trump has also filed a complaint against comey for interfering in a presidential election as a federal employee 
suspicion around comeys actions has grown as the fbi director is not expected to make any additional statements on this matter before the presidential election director comey appears to have set himself for problems after the election as senate democrats are making it known that they are open to holding hearings to investigate the fbi investigation if they win back the senate majority 
unless trump wins and republicans take control of congress director comey is going to have to answer for his decisions 
as the complaints pile up it looks like congressional testimony may be the least of james comeys future problems",2016-10-27

fox news sundays chris wallace tried to blame hillary clinton for the email scandal that republicans created and got destroyed by clinton campaign manager robbie mook 
this exchange between fox news sunday host chris wallace and clinton campaign manager robbie mook highlighted why the email scandal isnt working for the gop 
video 
transcript via fox news sunday wallace the last question i want to ask you is that youre acting as if it was the director who brought this into the election when the fact is that it was hillary clinton who brought this into the election 
i want to go back to the email exchange on march nd  when the new york times broke the story about hillary clinton using private emails were going to put it up on the screen 
clinton adviser neera tanden why didnt they get the stuff out like  months ago so crazy 
campaign chairman john podesta unbelievable tanden i guess i know the answer they wanted to get away with it 
robby it was clinton who delayed and it was clinton who brought this into the presidential campaign 
mook and it is secretary clinton who has said this was a mistake it is secretary clinton who cooperated fully with the investigation and it was secretary clinton who accepted the outcome of that investigation and what secretary clinton is doing now is saying if theres new information get it out on the table lets get it out these could be duplicates 
again its been reported these emails may not have been sent or received by secretary clinton we dont know anything and this close to an election this unprecedented announcement of new information when  when again its been reported by yahoo news that  that the fbi may have not even seen it that  that  that director comey sent this unprecedented letter shortly before the election when he doesnt even know what the information is thats disturbing and were just asking him get everything out there that he knows 
fox news has no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of clinton so they have been reduced to whining about why she didnt release the emails sooner what wallace left out was that the release of clintons emails represented an unprecedented level of disclosure 
hillary clinton didnt cause this email scandal house republicans misused their benghazi select committee to go on a fishing expedition for hillary clintons emails 
robbie mook destroyed fox news with facts because unlike donald trump hillary clinton hasnt worked to keep information hidden from the public trump has not released his tax returns medical records or an accounting of his business dealings with russia trump has been the least transparent nominee in more than  years 
republicans and conservative media are blaming clinton for the scandal that they created as justification for continuing the investigations of her after the election 
clintons campaign manager was able to wipe the floor with the republican talking points because at the end of the day the email scandal remains a conspiracy about nothing",2016-10-27

a trump supporter sporting a hillary for prison tshirt chanted jews sa in support of his candidate during a rally in arizona on saturday 
the target was the pen of reporters who have been fodder for trumps rhetoric at every rally 
the context while the crowd was chanting usa one man chanted jews sa words like that cant be spun or read into the intent and meaning were obvious to everyone 
watch here on video obtained by the huffington post  
this sort of thing comes as no surprise considering that donald trump spent the last year spewing hate filled venom in every possible direction it may seem superfluous to restate every category of people for which trump has shown contempt but it is not 
muslims jews immigrants labor taxpayers latinos hispanics mexicans africanamericans women pows veterans people with disabilities gold star families and the military have felt the sting of trumps words and the disdain in his heart 
throughout this campaign season the vitriol against hillary clinton saw no limit signs and tshirts too disgusting to quote in this article chants of lock her up at the republican convention and since trump promised his base of thugs lowlifes and haters he would weaken the first amendment strengthen the second and establish the altright utopia 
hillary clinton was already the most qualified candidate in this race she also proved to have more stamina than any previous candidate needed not only was she competing against a vicious and pathological liar she was competing for who we are and who we could be for all the trump claims that the media is rigged in clintons favor it was trump who got free advertising who framed the narrative and whose words were the primary news stories of the campaign 
there is no doubt that hillary clinton will keep her promise to fight for us she has been doing it from the beginning of this campaign every time hillary clinton called out donald trumps sexist comments she was fighting for all women who were attacked humiliated and sexually abused by men like trump every time clinton shamed trumps horrific and disgusting comments about the khan family she was standing up for every gold star family she was also standing up for every muslimamerican the same is true every time clinton condemned trump for mocking a disabled reporter or resorted to altright stereotypes about africanamericans innercities and africanamerican communities 
every time trump spewed hate in whatever direction hillary clinton defended the target 
so no this isnt about choosing the lesser of two evils like every election this is about choosing our next president more importantly its about voting for who we are and who we aspire to be

by contrast as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to secretary clinton you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible 
moreover in tarring secretary clinton with thin innuendo you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own department you rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election despite the fact that for all you know the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated secretary clinton

as a nation of laws the american people should and most likely do demand that law enforcement officials hew as closely to the law as humanly possible and that goes double for the countrys largest investigative agency one thing every american who has ever watched a law enforcement press conference after a crime has occurred understands is that the public never really knows the details of an investigation regardless the severity of the crime or who the suspect is as an occasional print journalist this author can attest that asking a police spokesman for details during a press conference about what the police are doing or who they are investigating never fails to get a stern scolding about expecting law enforcement to reveal any facts during an investigation for glaringly obvious reasons the scold always includes referral to the agency responsible for charging and prosecuting a crime after the investigation is complete and the results are handed over to the local district attorney 
apparently the federal bureau of investigation fbi director james comey never got the memo that discussing an investigation publicly is verboten if for no other reason than to maintain the integrity of said investigation and not hamper a possible prosecution however as it turns out mr comey did get a memo  from the department of justice in the form of a warning  but because he is a law unto himself and his allegiance is to house republicans and not the department of justice he ignored the doj counsel to do a solid for the gop less than two weeks before a presidential election 
since mr comey cant keep it investigations in his pants or follow longstanding law enforcement and investigative rules or take heed to justice department warnings it is incumbent on president barack obama to summarily fire fbi director james comey on the morning of wednesday november th  why should president obama wait until the day after a general election to fire the partisan director of the fbi so as not to give the appearance of any impropriety or partisanship during a campaign or just prior a presidential election something fbi director james comey is apparently incapable of comprehending 
this incident just like the one in july when comey broke precedent and convened a press conference in july and then publicly testified before congress to discuss the bureaus ongoing investigation is more than just a breach of precedent it smacks of partisanship for more than one reason first as mentioned above not only did the department of justice warn mr comey that it was inappropriate to discuss an ongoing investigation at all much less so close to an election that warning came after the fbi contacted the doj about going public with information the bureau admitted it had not yet even  reviewed  that was precisely what comey told his republican buddies in a letter to congress 
in the letter  comey told congressional republicans that the fbi really had no clue whether any of the emails were related to hillary clintons private email server but what he did  know  for sure was that they  appeared  to be pertinent even though his agency the fbi had not yet examined them so the real pertinent question is why did mr comey publicly inform congress about emails the agency had not yet examined if he wasnt attempting to inject some  partisan drama  into the election that might have deleterious impact on the outcome 
it is just as pertinent a question as demanding to know from mr comey precisely what his motivation was in holding a press conference back in july to discuss the agencys finding on an investigation before the doj weighed in or discuss that investigation in public and before a viciously partisan republican committee in congress and no it was not to defend the bureaus decision not to bring criminal charges against clinton only a braindead moronic imbecile or partisan republican hack would begin to think that the fbi cia local sheriff or any police investigative agency has the ability to bring charges to prosecute a violation for dogs sake even the s fictional sheriff andy griffiths hapless deputy barney fife was competent enough to comprehend that a district attorneys office or department of justice is tasked with prosecution any violation of the law 
according to mr comey who was  stung by criticism from both democrats and republicans  as well as former prosecutors and  appeared to be on the defensive   he felt obligated to inform republicans in congress  even though the bureau really didnt  know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails  likely because he knew they did not come from hillary clinton as an aside sarah jones has a nifty summary of the email caper the fbi uncovered while investigating  serial sexter  anthony weiners laptop computer ipad and cellphone and no anthony weiner was not sexting nasty pictures to presidential candidate hillary clinton 
it doesnt matter what kind of pathetic excuse comey gave for publicly commenting on an ongoing investigation it is virtually impossible to believe he didnt have partisan intents and purposes in publicly alerting house republicans as interim chairwoman of the democratic national committee donna brazile said  the fbi has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters  even the faintest appearance of using the agencys power to influence our election is deeply troubling  ms brazile demanded more information from comey and didnt conceal her concern over comey interfering with the election 
mr comey claimed very conveniently one might add that as a diedinthewool republican he contributed to john mccain and willard romneys presidential campaigns in  and  respectively that he is not a republican now that was his remark back in july when he first began breaking precedent and revealing information about an investigation that was the proper purview of the department of justice not the federal bureau of investigation it was a suspicious  confession  in july and it is nearly impossible to believe in late october after he ignored department of justice warnings and revealed information about an ongoing investigation into a disgraced former congressman and serial sexter just  days before an election and before the bureau had even reviewed anything 
comey cannot possibly remain as head of the federal bureau of investigation after twice revealing information about an ongoing investigation if comey hadnt taken heat for his reveal in july and a warning from the justice department this week then one might just regard him as an inept law enforcement official pulling a publicity stunt for attention but since he was warned and is not an inept law enforcement official it is more than reasonable to believe that comeys most recent act was a partisan political ploy that should earn him a summary termination on november   because firing his partisan personage just prior to the general election would break a longstanding precedent and look like a highly partisan move something a sap like james comey might try but not president obama",2016-10-28
302,mike pence campaign plane slides off runway after landing at laguardia airport,"by adalia woodbury on sun oct th  at  pm on friday the supreme court decided to weigh in on transgender rights in the case of gloucester county school board vs gg this gives the right wing another chance to take civil rights away from people they dont like plain and simple share on twitter print this post 
on friday the supreme court decided to weigh in on transgender rights in the case of gloucester county school board vs gg  this gives the right wing another chance to take civil rights away from people they dont like plain and simple 
at issue is whether a transgender student who identifies as a boy has a right to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender he identifies with 
last summer the court granted the school boards request to put a lower court ruling in the students favor on hold until the board filed its petition for review by the supreme court justice breyer joined the conservative justices in that ruling as a courtesy 
the virginia school board established a policy mirroring bathroom police laws in red states like north carolina that required students to use rest rooms and locker rooms to correspond with the gender they were assigned at birth 
in this case the district court ruled against gg by relying on a  regulation allowing schools to provide separate toilet locker room and shower facilities based on sex provided those facilities are comparable to those provided to the opposite sex 
in january  the department of educations office of civil rights issued a letter opining that if schools separate students in restroom and locker rooms based on their sex a school must treat transgender students in a manner consistent with their gender identity 
because of that letter the us court of appeals for the th circuit reversed the lower court ruling in favor of gg it relied on a  supreme court decision that courts generally should defer to an agencys interpretation of its own regulation 
in reality the right wing hopes to achieve two political objectives with this case first this is about denying basic rights and dignity to people who are transgender which is consistent with their ideological opposition to rights for women poc and members of the lgbt community second the right wing is hoping to weaken federal agencies by attacking their ability to interpret their own regulations",2016-10-28
303,trumps new defense strategy on access hollywood tape blame the microphone,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on mon oct st  at  am in donald trump you have a candidate who is frequently saying  false things in a day up to  on some days share on twitter print this post 
cnns brian stelter calls donald trump a uniquely factchallenged candidate which is a prelude to introducing daniel dale washington correspondent for the toronto star  who fact checks every single word trump utters and tallies them up for his paper  
dale says most factcheckers look at two or three things trump says meticulously factchecks them and posts an article but that doesnt work when you have a candidate who is frequently saying  false things in a day up to  on some days 
for example dale tallied  trump lies on tuesday october  donald trump said  false things yesterday trumpcheck pictwittercomewfyfedfx 
 daniel dale ddale october   
which as dale pointed out  followed his recordtying  false claims on monday not coincidentally a day on which trump called fact checkers scum 
watch courtesy of cnns reliable sources there is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty ddale says trump lies a lot more than clinton httpstcokpkvpntmo 
 reliable sources reliablesources october   
the mainstream media likes to play the false equivalence game but there is no equivalence between trump and clinton as dale told stelter there is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty trump says dale is not a normal political liar 
for example look at the presidential debates  in which dale found  trump false statements as opposed to  by clinton 
dales judgment is that there is no comparison in her level of accuracy with her opponent 
trump also lies pointlessly argues dale explaining to brian stelter that 
he gets things wrong where there is no political advantage to be gained and in those cases it is not clear whether hes lying or confused or unwilling to take the time to learn the facts 
this was mark cubans complaint of course that trump has no interest in learning 
in the end it matters less why trump lies than that he does especially since he is busily convincing his base that hillary clinton is the dishonest candidate and it is working this is a trope frequently repeated by trumps supporters you can correct them as often as you want it will have no effect 
the lie has taken hold  one of many  many more than you likely expected and observational bias takes care of the rest the trump base is effectively lost to our shared reality and as dale tweeted last night 
if trump loses the smart republican excavation is going to have to involve some long hard base reeducation 
given the gops history with facts good luck with that

304,trump is ahead in zero national polls while the media continues close race narrative,"by rmuse    am the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities if passed the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes our ministries   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
for almost all secular humanists organized religion is nothing more than an easy means of controlling people through fear and intimidation throughout recorded history the catholic church has been responsible for all manner of devious machinations to control not just its adherents but any humans it comes in contact with that lust to control human beings has continued unabated into the st century and in america like the rest of the earth the catholics number one focus has been on controlling women apparently the catholic church in massachusetts wants to expand its control over the population 
on friday the boston globe reported that the archdiocese of boston dropped about a million dollars in a lastditch effort to exert church control over massachusetts law and citizens to stop marijuana from being legalized for recreational use other reports reveal that the taxexempt political spending is meant to help defeat a massachusetts ballot measure question   question  simply legalizes cannabis for recreational use for people over  and creates a commission to regulate marijuana in the state of massachusetts question  contains no references to the catholic or any other church and makes no claim of trying to  impact ministries  
a spokesman for the boston archdiocese terrence donilon made a truly pathetic attempt at justifying the catholic churchs political donation to the campaign against massachusetts version of legalized recreational marijuana saying  
 it reflects the fact that the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities its a recognition that if passed the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes our ministries  
seriously that has to be one of the most monumental piles of bovine excrement of a reason to use taxfree congregants donations to interfere in an election ever offered nowhere in massachusetts or any states decriminalization statutes is any church mentioned much less affected by the outcome of an election catholic priests will still be free to sexually abuse little boys if adults can legally purchase and consume cannabis and despite residents having a toke in the privacy of their homes the church will still frighten its members into increasing their tithes and the usccb will still attempt to control and dominate all american women no reefer decriminalization will impact the catholic ministry but it will drastically reduce the number of people being arrested and imprisoned for marijuana possession free up law enforcement to pursue nasty pedophile priests and relieve americas overburdened judicial system 
now the catholics claim that people using cannabis legally whether they inhale or eat it will have  significantly detrimental impacts on their ministries  that is an odd assertion on yet another point surely part of catholic ministries is teaching according to their gods word in the christian bible it is nearly certain that every catholic priest on the planet including those in massachusetts are aware of gods word in genesis where in chapter  verse  the catholics  almighty god  said 
 out of the ground the lord god caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food  and he continues in verses    then the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to cultivate it and keep it the lord god commanded the man saying from any tree of the garden you may eat freely but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die  
although there is recorded evidence that cannabis was first discovered to be used for its medicinal qualities  years ago  there is no record of reefer ever being confused with  the tree of the knowledge of good and evil  weed is not and will not affect the catholic ministries if it is decriminalized today any more than it has over the past twothousand years the catholic church has existed and cannabis was either unknown to the clergy or illegal 
in a reaction to the news the archdiocese was interfering with politics with taxexempt money an advocate and spokesman for the yes on question  jim borghesani said  
 the archdiocese has come up with a position that frankly we think is based on unfounded assumptions and junk science what i think the archdiocese is missing is the terrible harm that marijuana prohibition has done to people of color to people who have chosen a substance that is less dangerous than alcohol and have had their lives ruined because theyve been arrested  
one wonders if part of the boston archdioceses ministry entails increasing the number of americans mainly americans of color sent to prison for possessing or using a plant that  god caused to grow  and was  pleasing to the sight and good to eat  obviously that is the case and according to a new set of data keeping marijuana illegal means keeping americans arrested for drug possession at a rate of every  seconds of every day of the year 
why is the catholic church so interested in perpetuating the failed war on drugs in general and the criminalization of marijuana in particular as noted by michael stone over at patheos what the massachusetts catholics and mormons are actually helping to sustain is  in reality a war on poor people and people of color  mr stone really nails it when he said that by spending taxexempt donations on a political agenda to  defend the unjust prohibition on marijuana the catholic church is guilty of perpetuating the failed war on drugs and the new jim crow  
the archdiocese is also guilty of hypocrisy besides implicit racism because any religious organization that condones and even promotes the use of alcohol while using taxexempt donations to maintain the ridiculous prohibition on cannabis is  morally indefensible  mormons are also busy instructing lds members to vote against all state initiatives that seek to decriminalize and regulate recreational marijuana use as if it has any affect whatsoever on either their private mormon lives or their lds ministry but they allegedly dont condone or enjoy alcohol so they just have control issues and are not blatant hypocrites at least where cannabis decriminalization is concerned 
the massachusetts catholics may not be violating the law by  acting as an antimarijuana super pac  but they are using taxexempt member donations to politically influence an election and control other americans lives the church is all about wielding ultimate control over all facets of american society however if the church is so flush with money why not use that money to compensate the thousands of victims of the churchs pedophile priests or dog forbid use that taxexempt donors money to help the people of massachusetts in need 
the catholic church is guilty of using fear and intimidation to control its own adherents and that is down to frightened people needing a  daddy figure in the church to tell them what is right what is wrong and how to stay out of the proverbial hell that is all well and good for people that willingly cry out for a controlling organization speaking for a deity but for people that are not  in the church  it is an affront to use donated taxexempt money to impact read control their private lives the only good news out of this abominable story is that it looks like question  will pass with relative ease informing that the archdiocese wasted about a million dollars of its congregations hardearned money 
this is yet another example of why all churches should be taxed like every other business and american citizen except donald trump it is  morally obnoxious  that the archdiocese is using the congregations donations for political purposes to influence an election and yet another sign that there is no area the church considers as out of bounds in attempting to control every aspect of society with taxexempt funds wrung out of hardworking americans many of whom use recreational cannabis

305,in the first  days of october trump gave just k to his own campaign,"by hrafnkell haraldsson    am we cant do waterboarding its far too tough were fighting on a different level we have to be toughand in some cases pretty vicious   
donald trump complains about spending a fortune on a war in the middle east that he supported a war brought to us by a republican administration that knowingly lied about the facts trump is also lying about the facts which at least brings our countrys middle east ordeal fullcircle 
according to trump speaking at a rally in new mexico  and youve no doubt seen the barrage of commercials repeating the same lie  hillary brought disaster to iraq syria libya and every place that she touches she empowered iran and she unleashed isis by leaving that big vacuum 
of course it was republican president george w bush who negotiated the balance of forces agreement with iraq stipulating that america draw down its combat strength reneging on that agreement would have meant not peace in iraq or a negation of isis but a second us invasion on top of the rise of isis 
we want peace through strength trump told the crowd we dont want to be in wars but these savages are chopping off heads 
well in fact we did want to be in that war we invaded iraq not vice versa 
trump went on to say 
drowning people in steel cages burying people in the sand we havent had  this is medieval times this is medieval times and then we cant do waterboarding its far too tough you know were fighting on a different level see were fighting on a different level folks and we have to be tough and we have to be smart and we have to be in some cases pretty vicious to be honest with you pretty vicious but we have to take them out and then we have to get back to building our country because our country  weve spent  trillion in the middle east  trillion and we couldve rebuilt our country twice 
never mind for a moment that torture is illegal under international law never mind that a  senate intelligence committees report said torture doesnt work trumps argument sounds once again like a child wanting to get back at another child who has aggrieved him 
this is trump wanting to spite his enemies on an international scale and arguing to boot that the end justifies the means 
he doesnt because he cant prove that acting like barbarians somehow doesnt make us barbarians ourselves he certainly cant prove because that senate report says otherwise that torturing people will win the war 
the claim of  million by the way is one trump made last week in charlotte nc as well and politifact ruled it half true at the time saying 
trump is citing the highend estimate of credible analyses of spending associated with the wars in iraq and afghanistan yet he is confusing money thats been spent with money that researchers say will be spent 
the point here is that this is a war begun not by obama and certainly not by hillary clinton who at least admits she supported it and has apologized for doing so while trump continued to deny he was ever for it despite the facts to the contrary 
when trump says we have to be pretty vicious he is also saying we have to be pretty dishonest and nobody lies with such success or at such a rate as donald trump 
trump has said he loves war he has said he likes to be unpredictable he has asked why we cant use nuclear weapons since we have them this is a man most national security experts say should not have the nuclear football in his hands 
this is a man who no matter how much he claims otherwise does not understand how the world works and he does not understand that by promoting torture he is only fulfilling the wildest propaganda wishes of the islamic state by promising to do precisely what they want him to do",2016-10-28

307,the banishment of trump has begun as the american people are tuning him out,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on mon oct st  at  pm trump refused  produce records sought by prosecutors for  months said under oath was destroying them whole time share on twitter print this post 
newsweek s kurt eichenwald has struck again reporting that donald trump refused  produce records sought by prosecutors for  months said under oath was destroying them whole time 
the whole strategy he writes at newsweek in an article he swears was written before comeys announcement was deny impede and delay while destroying documents the court had ordered them to hand over 
in  he reveals the republican nominee his father and their real estate company battled the federal government over civil charges that they refused to rent apartments to africanamericans 
shortly after the government filed its case in october trump attacked he falsely declared to reporters that the feds had no evidence he and his father discriminated against minorities but instead were attempting to force them to lease to welfare recipients who couldnt pay their rentthe familys attempts to slow down the federal case were at times nonsensical trump submitted an affidavit contending that the government had engaged in some unspecified wrongdoing by releasing statements to the press on the day it brought the case without first having any formal communications with him he contended that hed learned of the complaint only while listening to his car radio that morning but trumps sworn statement was a lie court records show that the government had filed its complaint at  am and phoned him almost immediately afterward the government later notified the media with a press release  six months after the original filing the case was nowhere because the trumps had repeatedly ignored the deadlines to produce records and answers to questions known as interrogatoriesfinally under subpoena trump appeared for a short deposition when asked about the missing documents he made a shocking admission the trumps had been destroying their corporate records for the previous six months and had no documentretention program they had conducted no inspections to determine which files might have been sought in the discovery requests or might otherwise be related to the case instead in order to save space trump testified officials with his company had been tossing documents into the shredder and garbage 
so trump can accuse hillary clinton of destroying emails  and he does nearly every day  but only as a means of covering up and deflecting his own misdeeds in that regard 
with false affidavits and deny and delay strategies writes eichenwald trump  his cos hid and destroyed records sought in court 
donald trump is a world class liar and a man known for his deflection tactics projecting his own guilt onto others his foundation in trouble point the finger at the clinton foundation sexual assault allegations point the finger at bill and hillary clinton 
once again kurt eichenwald has dug into donald trumps deplorable past and revealed the real donald trump its not pretty and each revelation from eichenwald and david fahrenthold shows trump to be an even worse human being than the last

the democratic coalition against trump announced the complaint in a statement 
the democratic coalition against trump filed a complaint against representative jason chaffetz on monday morning with the office of congressional ethics for his role in releasing information provided to him by fbi director james comey 
representative chaffetz in an illplanned partisan attempt released information that compromised the integrity of the fbi when he irresponsibly tweeted out that the case investigating secretary clintons emails had been reopened when in fact it had not been members of congress are elected to make our country a safer better place not to use their power to work with leaders such as comey in a partisan fashion i hope that both are held accountable for their actions said scott dworkin senior advisor to the democratic coalition against trump 
director comey is already facing a complaint that was filed with department of justic e accusing him of violating the hatch act by using his position as a federal employee to influence the outcome of an election 
the comey letter couldnt have gone much worse for republicans what the gop originally hoped was an election shifting moment had become a republican scandal that democrats are strongly suggesting will inspiring hearings if they win back the senate majority

cnn has obtained brand new audio of north carolina republican senator richard burr joking about gun owners putting a bullseye on hillary clinton 
the despicable comments come as burr faces a close senate race against democratic opponent deborah ross both candidates are within a point of each other according to realclearpolitics 
more of the cnn report  
the north carolina republican locked in a tight race for reelection quipped that as he walked into a gun shop nothing made me feel better than seeing a magazine about rifles with a picture of hillary clinton on the front of it 
i was a little bit shocked at that  it didnt have a bullseye on it he said saturday to gop volunteers prompting laughter from the crowd in mooresville north carolina but on the bottom right of the magazine it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for so let me assure you theres an army of support out there right now for our candidates 
this type of rhetoric is hardly uncommon when it comes to republican leaders in  as the campaign has gone on the hateful and violent rhetoric particularly from the man at the top of the republican ticket has become increasingly worse 
at one point this year donald trump suggested that second amendment people should take up arms against clinton if she nominates a supreme court justices they dont like he also said that hed like to see what happens if the democratic nominees bodyguards were disarmed 
as cnn notes trump has never issued a genuine apology for his dangerous language  or anything hes ever said or done  but burr quickly came out with a statement once the audio was revealed although it does not excuse what he said 
the comment i made was inappropriate and i apologize for it the republican senator said according to cnn 
this type of imagery has no place in our politics regardless of whether its being said in public or private especially given the heightened level of anger and hatred toward hillary clinton from trump supporters

a new report is painting cia director james comey as having used his office to influence the presidential election as comey sent a letter about hillary clintons emails but refused to call out russia for meddling in the election by hacking democrats 
cnbc reported  fbi director james comey argued privately that it was too close to election day for the united states government to name russia as meddling in the us election and ultimately ensured that the fbis name was not on the document that the us government put out a former fbi official tells cnbc 
 
according to the former official comey agreed with the conclusion the intelligence community came to a foreign power was trying to undermine the election he believed it to be true but was against putting it out before the election comeys position this official said was if it is said it shouldnt come from the fbi which as youll recall it did not 
director comey didnt want to interfere in the presidential election by releasing information that could harm republican presidential nominee donald trump but he had no qualms about sending a letter to congress about emails that he had never seen in an apparent effort to interfere in the current presidential election 
with each new revelation and detail it is becoming impossible not to come to the conclusion that fbi director comey may have violated the hatch act with his letter to congress it is illegal for federal employees to use their positions to interfere in elections 
when the information was bad for donald trump comey argued that it should not be publicly released so close to the election however he embraced a different standard when he had less information but could frame it in a way that could damage hillary clintons campaign 
it is becoming clear that comey has abused his power and must be removed as fbi director immediately",2016-10-28
311,hillary clinton is brilliantly forcing broke trump to spend money defending arizona,"the washington post reported donald trumps hiring of pollster tony fabrizio in may was viewed as a sign that the real estate mogul was finally bringing seasoned operatives into his insurgent operation 
but the republican presidential nominee appears to have taken issue with some of the services provided by the veteran gop strategist who has advised candidates from  gop nominee bob dole to florida gov rick scott the trump campaigns latest federal election commission report shows that it is disputing nearly  that fabrizios firm says it is still owed for polling 
trumps decision not to pay his pollster is the first of this type of story but given trumps history of not paying for services performed it wont be the last it is astonishing that the party of supposed fiscal responsibility and conservativism would put someone forward as their presidential nominee who has made a career out of running up debt for personal gain 
donald trumps mentality has always been to put himself first paying his debts never seems to have been a top priority for trump his businesses have been stiffing vendors and contractors for decades so it isnt surprising that he would bring this same mentality to the presidential campaign 
anybody who works for the trump campaign would be smart to get paid up front because donald trumps version of making america great involves taking your money and putting it in his own pocket

while the media continues to focus on what is increasingly becoming a nonstory  fbi director james comeys vague letter regarding more emails related to hillary clinton  news about donald trumps ties to russia continues to gain steam 
not only did nbc just report that the fbi is now in the preliminary stages of investigating trumps excampaign managers connection to russia but slate also reported on monday that a trump server may have repeatedly been communicating with a russian bank 
slate claims that while a group of computer scientists was looking into the russian cyber attack of the dnc they stumbled onto something unexpectedly 
the report 
in late july one of these scientistswho asked to be referred to as tea leaves a pseudonym that would protect his relationship with the networks and banks that employ him to sift their datafound what looked like malware emanating from russia the destination domain had trump in its name which of course attracted tea leaves attention but his discovery of the data was pure happenstancea surprising needle in a large haystack of dns lookups on his screen i have an outlier here that connects to russia in a strange way he wrote in his notes he couldnt quite figure it out at first but what he saw was a bank in moscow that kept irregularly pinging a server registered to the trump organization on fifth avenue 
more data was needed so he began carefully keeping logs of the trump servers dns activity as he collected the logs he would circulate them in periodic batches to colleagues in the cybersecurity world six of them began scrutinizing them for clues 
the researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack the communication wasnt the work of bots the irregular pattern of server lookups actually resembled the pattern of human conversationconversations that began during office hours in new york and continued during office hours in moscow it dawned on the researchers that this wasnt an attack but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the trump organization and two servers registered to an entity called alfa bank 
this news doesnt come out of nowhere trump has repeatedly praised vladimir putin as a strong leader all while taking prorussia positions throughout the campaign that come straight off a kremlin wishlist 
the clinton campaign was quick to jump on the report in a statement by clinton senior policy adviser jake sullivan 
this secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of trumps ties to russia it certainly seems the trump organization felt it had something to hide given that it apparently took steps to conceal the link when it was discovered by journalists 
this line of communication may help explain trumps bizarre adoration of vladimir putin and endorsement of so many prokremlin positions throughout this campaign it raises even more troubling questions in light of russias masterminding of hacking efforts that are clearly intended to hurt hillary clintons campaign we can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between trump and russia as part of their existing probe into russias meddling in our elections 
trumps prorussia rhetoric and policy positions are not a coincidence the more information that comes out the clearer it is that the republican nominee has connections to russia that he is hiding from voters 
with just a week until election day this is the explosive story the media should be focusing on its critical that the american people know what kind of financial ties a potential president has with an american adversary especially when that adversary is russia",2016-10-28
314,revived clinton email scandal killed by a slew of new facts in record time,"by sean colarossi on mon oct st  at  pm trump used a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the internal revenue service would likely declare it improper if he were audited share on twitter print this post 
while donald trump has repeatedly said he took advantage of loopholes that allowed him to legally pay nothing in federal income taxes for decades the new york times reported on monday that trump may have actually crossed a legal boundary to avoid paying his fair share 
according to the times the republican nominee used a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the internal revenue service would likely declare it improper if he were audited 
the report 
tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for the new york times said mr trumps tax avoidance maneuver conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time whatever loophole existed was not exploited here but stretched beyond any recognition said steven m rosenthal a senior fellow at the nonpartisan tax policy center who helped draft tax legislation in the early s 
moreover the tax experts said the maneuver trampled a core tenet of american tax policy by conferring enormous tax benefits to mr trump for losing vast amounts of other peoples money  in this case money investors and banks had entrusted to him to build a casino empire in atlantic city 
the reason that trump bent over backward  and potentially broke laws  to avoid paying these taxes is because he was scrambling to stave off financial ruin 
this is the same man who claims he would be a great president because of his successful business background 
yet he calls himself the king of debt his businesses have declared bankruptcy six times he has spent decades paying zero dollars in federal income taxes he lost a billion dollars in a single year running a casino business reporting out tonight even suggests that he has direct financial ties to russia 
all of this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his business background 
even as all of this information is out there american voters still know very little about donald trumps finances because he has refused to be transparent about them 
and consider this what trump is hiding in his tax returns must be much worse than the already damning information that keeps coming out through good reporting if it werent he would have already released them 
the latest new york times story is just the latest installment of trumps shady business background the media should spend the remaining week of this campaign demanding more answers from a man who wants to be in charge of the countrys pocketbook",2016-10-28
315,reality slaps donald trump in the face as us economy roars back,"by sarah jones on tue nov st  at  am the united states district court in new jersey ordered discovery on donald trump and the rncs poll monitoring efforts with a hearing on november th just days before the november th election share on twitter print this post 
republicans are being ordered to explain their comments that they will be monitoring the polls for voter fraud 
the united states district court in new jersey ordered discovery on donald trump and the rncs poll monitoring efforts with a hearing on november th just days before the november th election 
the order demands affidavits from several parties including from someone with personal knowledge about the defendants rncs efforts with the trump campaign to monitor precincts around the country as indicated by kellyanne conway 
affidavits are also demanded from several republican operatives in various states who are said to be conducting state wide voter fraud monitoring and poll monitoring such as rnc member rob gleasons efforts to recruit persons to act as poll watchers in philadelphia pennsylvania and rnc member ronna romney mcdaniels efforts in michigan to prepare a massive statewide antivoter fraud effort 
the rnc must also answer for governor mike pences comments that the trump campaign is working with state governments and secretaries of state to ensure ballot integrity 
this is what happens when you have zero regard for election law and try to go vigilante 
rick hasen at election law blog noted that the discovery granted is pretty broad pretty broad discovery required in short order with hearing on november  
however the judge rejected much of the discovery sought by the dnc given the time frame but this should alone should be pretty educational on what efforts are actually going on behind the scenes 
the dnc filed a lawsuit against the republican national committee for violating a  court order intended to prevent voter intimidation over donald trumps claims that the election is rigged and that his supporters need to go to the polls to intimidate voters 
donald trumps urging that his supporters go to polling places other than their own often in urban areas to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree and the court isnt likely to stand for it 
so now discovery has been courtordered which is just more bad news for republicans who are already facing an uphill battle in their bid for the white house 
its exceptionally unpatriotic to try to intimidate fellow citizens from exercising their right to vote everyone has the right to vote free of intimidation dont let anyone dissuade you from voting

316,trump wrecks any hope gop had of taking advantage of clinton email investigation,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on tue nov st  at  am last springnew york had to take legal action to collect  in unpaid taxes on the trumpowned company that owns the trademark boeing    
we looked yesterday at kurt eichenwalds revelation that donald trump put off investigators for six months while busily destroying emails that is hardly trumps only misdeed but how many people realize that donald trump at this moment has   seventyfive  legal issues hanging over his head 
hes lying  to  times a day and has his followers  and with much less excuse the mainstream media  thoroughly distracted by the clinton email nonstory so he can divert their attention away from his own legally questionable activities 
usa today reported at the end of october that just two weeks before election day at least  of the plus lawsuits involving trump and his businesses remain open according to an ongoing nationwide analysis of state and federal court records by usa today 
it will surprise no one because trump is already deadbeating on his own pollster  that one trump case over nonpayment of tips to caterers at trump soho hotel in new york city is scheduled to go to trial a week before election day 
if one thing has become clear throughout this election it is that trump does not pay his bills earlier we had covered an incident where he had declined to finish paying a florida contractor for work it did on one of his resorts having decided that the contractor had been paid enough even though it wasnt the agreedupon amount trump got nailed by the court for k in attorneys fees in that case 
just a few examples from usa todays investigation 
trump faces significant open litigation tied to his businesses angry members at his jupiter fla golf course say they were cheated out of refunds on their dues and a former employee at the same club claims she was fired after reporting sexual harassment theres a fraud case brought by trump university students who say the moguls company ripped them off for tens of thousands in tuition for a sham real estate course trump is also defending lawsuits tied to his campaign a disgruntled gop political consultant sued for  million saying trump defamed her another suit a class action says the campaign violated consumer protection laws by sending unsolicited text messages 
as pointed out by usa todays nick penzenstadler and john kelly these lawsuits will dog trump into the white house should he win he will have no immunity because he is president and america  and the world  will be treated to the spectacle of the president of the united states having to make trip after trip to the court to settle his highly questionable personal and business affairs 
there are harassment cases sex discrimination lawsuits fraud unpaid bills racist comments defamation cases involving trump university as usa today notes as recently as last springnew york had to take legal action to collect  in unpaid taxes on the trumpowned company that owns the trademark boeing  that jetted the mogul to campaign rallies across the country 
and those  cases will likely grow 
trump has promised after all to sue the new york times and each of the women  nymag maintains an exhaustive list  who have accused him of sexual assault 
usa today says it spent six months researching court records the exclusive analysis they say found an unprecedented mountain of legal battles for a presidential candidate ranging from skirmishes with pageant contestants to multimillion dollar real estate lawsuits the cases offer clues to the leadership style the billionaire would bring to the white house 
donald trump claims clinton is tainted he claims clintons emails are bigger than watergate the other day tweeted  we must not let crookedhillary take her criminal scheme into the oval office draintheswamp 
this comes from the man who would turn the  pennsylvania avenue into a morality nogo zone

317,gop scandal falls apart as new emails didnt come from hillary clintons server,"by rmuse    am the voter suppression tactic is right out of the gop election rigging playbook to suppress the black vote in north carolina   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
some americans are likely aware of the psychological term projecting that roughly means a person attributes their own faults and actions onto someone else as an unconscious form of transferring guilt for ones own actions as soon as the republican primaries concluded donald trump projected republicans guilt for election rigging either through vote obstruction or suppression onto democrats and his opponent hillary clinton republicans have been actively suppressing votes since the election of barack obama in  and they have only ramped up their  election rigging activities over the past eight years and yet trump accuses democrats of election rigging as frequently as most human beings draw breath 
yesterday the north carolina conference of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp filed a lawsuit against north carolina republicans and demanded they put an immediate stop to the  coordinated effort to suppress the black vote in the state  what the naacp rightly said was that the voter suppression tactic was  right out of the gop election rigging playbook to suppress the black vote in the state  
the election rigging amounts to three counties in north carolina canceling voter registration of thousands of mostly african american democratic residents a week before the presidential election the lawsuit charged election officials in beaufort moore and cumberland counties of denying primarily african american voters eligibility to participate in democracy because their voter registration documents mysteriously were  bounced back as undeliverable  
most of the voters whose eligibility to vote was denied and flagged for purging such as james edward arthur sr had moved within the same county and were still legally allowed to cast ballots many of the purged voters lived at their  original registration address  and were victims of a  simple postal service error  
mr arthur is an african american who lives in a nursing home and has voted in at least the last  elections in the same county he was born and raised in without issue arthur testified that he like thousands of other african american democratic voters never received any state or county election documents informing him that his eligibility was denied or that if he didnt attend an appeal hearing to maintain his right to vote he would be denied the right to participate in democracy mr arthur said 
 if i knew my right to vote was in jeopardy i would do whatever i could to protect it i want and plan to vote in the upcoming election but i am concerned that since my registration has been canceled i will not be able to cast a ballot or it will not be counted  
it is what any sane human being would consider  election rigging  simply because the tricounty ploy targeted primarily african americans who typically vote for democrats it is also something north carolina republicans have been guilty of for the past six years 
according to the naacp lawsuit north carolina republicans are in violation of the national voter registration act which  bans the systemic removal of voters from the rolls in the final  days before an election  republican election officials state officials defended their  election rigging  and said they were justified in  purging tensofthousands  of mainly african american democratic voters eligibility the definition of systemic on an individual basis 
however the naacp also accused republicans of conducting a coordinated mailing campaign for the sole purpose of challenging the eligibility of thousands of mainly african american voters eligibility who did not receive the mailing one republican who ran for a local office last year shane hubers challenged the registration of voters?the majority who are them democrats ?in beaufort county 
in one of the other counties charged in the lawsuit cumberland county one  individual used returned mail to challenge the registrations of  mostly democratic voters  in moore county the secretary of the local republican party n carol wheeldon challenged approximately  mainly african american registered voters likely because they do not vote for republicans 
the lead attorney for the naacps lawsuit penda hair said that although she cannot yet prove there is a concerted republican  election rigging  conspiracy 
 we know that in two of the counties the people who brought the challenges had connections to the local republican party we also know that the pattern of these challenges is very similar across the counties  ms hair also noted that  in moore county the return address of a rightwing group called the voter integrity project appeared on the mail that was used to challenge voters this is a very pernicious treatment of voters  she said it is also a deliberate act of  election rigging  by republicans 
the president of the north carolina naacp reverend dr william barber said 
 we are seeing the worst attempts of voter suppression here in north carolina that weve seen since the days of jim crow the tar heel state is ground zero in the intentional surgical efforts to suppress the voice of voters these attempts are a direct affront to our constitution  
the naacp lawsuit is demanding the state reinstate all voters challenged since  using this election rigging  process back on the rolls immediately the organization also demands that the state notifies the voters that they have been reinstated as eligible voters and allow them to cast regular ballots early or on election day they have already put in a request for an emergency hearing this week to decide the case 
it might be the case that the naacps request for a hearing may be granted especially in light of these new charges arising just days after a federal court ruled that north carolina republicans violated the national voter registration act in yet another manner failing to add tens of thousands of voters to the rolls who registered at a dmv office over the past few years 
last thursday us district court judge loretta biggs ordered north carolina republicans to permit those tensofthousands of voters to cast provisional ballots it is highly doubtful that north carolina republicans will obey the federal judges orders because they have been the recipients of several court orders over their election rigging actions that have had no effect whatsoever or the republicans would not continue disenfranchising voters 
republicans have been on a tear to rig elections since the american people first elected barack obama as president and the conservatives on the supreme court are ultimately guilty of conspiring with republicans to suppress or obstruct the voting rights of primarily people of color because they dont support republicans to be perfectly clear it is irrelevant if it is called voter suppression obstruction or disenfranchisement it is a deliberate attempt to rig elections and it is only republicans and the koch brothers outfit the american legislative exchange council alec who are behind each and every attempt in republicancontrolled states to kill democracy by doing what the republican party standard bearer donald trump is guilty of projecting rig elections",2016-10-28
318,donald trump calls a black supporter a paid thug and kicks him out of his rally,"by hrafnkell haraldsson    am the kkk newspaper features the front page full page story make america great again with a big featured center photo of donald trump   
rachel maddow traces the history of the postcivil war enforcement acts signed by president ulysses s grant including the ku klux klan act  or the enforcement act of   stat  which still makes it illegal to conspire to intimidate voters 
to show that the klan act is not vestigial but very much relevant in this election maddow points to the citation of this law by the democrat party in a whole raft of lawsuits in nevada arizona pennsylvania and ohio alleging voter intimidation 
maddow points out that though voter intimidation is illegal anyway the significance of the klan act is that it prohibits conspiracy to prevent by force intimidation or threat any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an elector for president or vice president or as a member of congress of the united states 
as an example of the role the kkk plays in trumps campaign maddow produced the kkks newspaper of today which bills itself as the political voice of white christian america which you might note is identical with fox news demographic this paper she says has been turning up on front lawns in the great state of georgia 
watch courtesy of msnbc discussion begins at  mark 
tonight we just got a hold of this disgusting development this is the newspaper of the ku klux klan today its the crusader the political voice of white christian america the premier voice of white resistance theyve got  you see the white power symbol there in the upper righthand corner theyve got a whole media operation going on apparently watch white pride tv listen to kkk radio  hours a day this newsletter is about  pages long features articles on the threat of nonwhite immigration a very subtle feature on black people committing terrible crimes against white people theres an article by the founder of the america first party which is all about the terrorist jews he brags in his byline that hes the man who david duke credits for awakening him to the threat of jewish supremacism its exactly what you would think from the ku klux klan newspaper if you knew there was a ku klux klan newspaper these days but the front page full page story is make america great again with a big featured center photo of donald trump its one of several articles in the paper about trump including this inset article about how trumps candidacy is moving the dialogue forward  those are a couple of the many many robocalls that were made during the republican primary campaign on behalf of donald trumps candidacy calls made by a white nationalist group that calls itself the american national super pac the trump campaign doesnt appear to have anything to do with these calls they reportedly returned a donation from the white nationalist guy who you hear on the call when it was first reported that he was making these calls and that he was a trump donor it was further embarrassing to the trump campaign when this guy this farmer and white nationalist who does these robocalls he was initially picked to be a trump delegate to the republican convention this year before his delegate status once got yanked once it was widely reported 
donald trumps white supremacist followers have made no secret of the fact that they want a white homeland and that of necessity the united states must be this white homeland as maddow has pointed out in the past and by their own admission their eugenics insanity is now out in the open because of donald trump 
dont believe maddow demographics pro looked at  donald trump twitter supporters and found that more than one third follow white nationalist twitter accounts 
the fact is trump has mainstreamed white supremacy and by not strongly denouncing it brought it into his own movement which seems to be a meeting place for much more than disaffected white workingclass americans whatever the mainstream media tells you 
the trump campaign is a maelstrom of hate and the kkk is right at the heart of it",2016-10-29
319,hillary clinton laughs when asked if the new emails could sink her campaign,"in a major omen of potential election disaster for republicans donald trump has scored the lowest rating in the history of gallups presidential leadership poll

voters rate trump worse than any other presidential candidate in gallups records on having the personality and leadership qualities a president should have previous readings were taken in late october in the   and  campaigns in those years between  and  of registered voters said the two majorparty candidates had the right personality and leadership qualities  a sharp contrast to trumps current  clintons rating of  is one percentage point below the previous low score 
clintons score while low was one point of the range for previous presidential cycles going back to  trumps score was twenty percent below the lowest score in the history of the poll 
voters arent going to elect a man to be the next president who they view as lacking the basic qualities of presidential leadership the popular vote total in  may reflect the nations political polarization but there is a reason why electoral map projections continue to look very good for the democratic candidate 
donald trump has failed the most elemental test for any presidential candidate he doesnt look act or behave like a person who has the qualities needed to occupy the oval office and lead the united states of america 
the last week before election day tension that is in the air is normal but the fundamental motivating factors of this contest havent changed democrats are holding on to their electoral map advantage while donald trump has become the central issue and question on the ballot

320,the real reason why the clinton email scandal is back has nothing to do with helping trump,"by sarah jones on tue nov st  at  am a veteran spy is alleging that russia is cultivating supporting and assisting donald trump and has been for at least five years the spy said the response from the fbi was shock and horror share on twitter print this post 
a veteran spy is alleging that russia is cultivating supporting and assisting donald trump and has been for at least five years the spy said the response from the fbi was shock and horror 
the report alleges that trump and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the kremlin and that russian intelligence claims to have compromised trump on his visits and could blackmail him 
david corn at mother jones reported 
mother jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote the first memo based on the former intelligence officers conversations with russian sources noted russian regime has been cultivating supporting and assisting trump for at least  years aim endorsed by putin has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance it maintained that trump and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the kremlin including on his democratic and other political rivals it claimed that russian intelligence had compromised trump during his visits to moscow and could blackmail him it also reported that russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on hillary clinton based on bugged conversations she had on various visits to russia and intercepted phone calls 
the former intelligence officer says the response from the fbi was shock and horror the fbi after receiving the first memo did not immediately request additional material according to the former intelligence officer and his american associates yet in august they say the fbi asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources the former spy forwarded to the bureau several memossome of which referred to members of trumps inner circle after that point he continued to share information with the fbi its quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on he says 
in august corn reports the fbi asked the spy for all information related to his findings and he continued to share information with the fbi which he says made it clear there was a pretty substantial inquiry going on 
if this report is accurate the spys information confirms what senator harry reid says intelligence experts and fbi director james comey already shared with him regarding explosive information regarding ties and coordination between donald trump and russia 
this report also rings true given report about the trump server repeatedly being connected to russia including trumps server possibly communicating with a russian bank 
it also makes sense given the many ties to russia within trumps own campaign and indeed trumps own rhetoric regarding nato and russia trump changed the republican party platforms proukraine proposals and talked about weakening nato both of which mirrored putins wish list nbc reported monday evening that the fbi is in the preliminary stages of investigating trumps excampaign managers connection to russia 
donald trump has already been busted for reading russian propaganda at his rallies as newsweeks kurt eichenwald uncovered an instance of trump reading propaganda directly from putin at a rally in pennsylvania 
eichenwald pointed out something vital and that is that the russians have been hacking into american emails and then falsifying them in hopes of impacting the presidential election the russians have been obtaining american emails and now are presenting complete misrepresentations of themfalsifying themin hopes of setting off a cascade of events that might change the outcome of the presidential election the big question of course is why are the russians working so hard to damage clinton and in the process aid donald trump 
the answer to why putin is trying so hard to defeat clinton might be in multiple reports that he fears her unlike donald trump hillary clinton is no pushover according to former us officials putin sees clinton as a forceful proponent of regime change policies that the russian leader considers a grave threat to his own survival 
trump has been acting like someone already groomed by the kremlin hes been a willing puppet for their dangerous goal of destroying western democracy he is easily flattered and easily manipulated its also easy to see how they could have gotten something on him with which to blackmail him  see the billy bush bus tape of trump bragging about sexual assault trump is easy bait 
the fact that the fbi director felt compelled to announce something about hillarys emails that turned out to not be about her emails but about her aides emails and even then he wasnt sure what they said or even if they were duplicates but he chose to keep this explosive information about donald trumps ties to russia under wraps is very disturbing 
this isnt a matter of partisan disagreement about the rules the fbi follows about ongoing investigations this is a matter of national security at this point if all of these reports from different sources are accurate but the fact that they come from different sources and that trump willingly staffed his own campaign with russian ties and he is advocating for their dream positions and he reads their propaganda straight from the vault so to speak  these facts add up to what looks like a terrifying fire of epic proportions",2016-10-29
321,doj complaint filed against fbi director james comey for interfering in presidential election,"by sarah jones on tue nov st  at  pm comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the fbi investigated russian interference with the us presidential election and so he told the obama administration not to accuse russia of the dnc hackings lest they be seen as partisan share on twitter print this post 
russia did hack the democrats so all of that email information that the media has been reporting came from a foreign entity that seeks to alter the outcome of the us election 
but fbi director james comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the fbi investigated russian interference with the us presidential election and so he told the obama administration not to accuse russia of the dnc hackings lest they be seen as partisan 
republican fbi director james comey advised the obama administration not to publicly accuse russia of hacking the dnc and more on the grounds that it would make the administration appear unduly partisan too close to the nov  election officials familiar with the deliberations told the washington post 
these sources with knowledge of the internal discussions spoke to the post on the condition of anonymity 
there are a few reasons why comey might want to keep his agencys investigation of russian interference under the radar but given his choice to publicly suggest that his agency might be reopening its exhaustive investigation of clintons emails which resulted from a republicanled bogus overreaching and seemingly endless benghazi investigation that also cleared clinton it seems odd that comey was going to stay silent on the russia matter 
comeys decisions is especially odd given the reports that the russians have been communicating and coordinating with republican presidential nominee donald trump to the point that he is already compromised 
only one of these matters might allow a foreign power control over the united states president 
the same sources tell the post that comey made the decision to reveal the clinton emails to congress because he had already testified in that matter and said the investigation was closed which suggests that he was concerned with his own reputation 
not sure im buying that because if comey really only cared about his own reputation ahead of not appearing partisan he wouldnt have said anything at all but that doesnt mean that his motives were nefarious 
there might well be good reason for this  after all this is the fbi and they cant tell us everything but as of right now comey has mishandled this and appears to be trying to influence an election to help republicans just because he is a republican and just because he has donated to republicans doesnt mean he isnt doing his job properly 
but comey has a lot of explaining to do right now he is under fire for good reason as the explanations hes giving for these decisions dont make sense and are contradictory",2016-10-29

in the letter  the economists listed a dozen economic policy reasons why voters should not vote for trump but it as their conclusion that was stunning he promotes magical thinking and conspiracy theories over sober assessments of feasible economic policy optionsdonald trump is a dangerous destructive choice for the country he misinforms the electorate degrades trust in public institutions with conspiracy theories and promotes willful delusion over engagement with reality if elected he poses a unique danger to the functioning of democratic and economic institutions and to the prosperity of the country for these reasons we strongly recommend that you do not vote for donald trump 
trumps thoughts on the economy are dangerous to the prosperity of the country it isnt just that trump is a person of bad character who lacks any of the human traits that voters should seek in a president it is also that his policies are nonsense

the trump campaign has always been about making much out of nothing elections are not rigged if trump gets his way and neither are polls if trump is leading otherwise its all leftwing shenanigans 
however even newt gingrich isnt buying the new poll washington postabc poll is an absurdity trump has not moved up  points in the last  dayshe was never  points behind ignore polls 
 newt gingrich newtgingrich november   
and what trump fails to mention is that his lead disappears if johnson and stein are taken out of the mix then clinton leads by   
these latest claims are an absolute sham as clinton leads overwhelmingly in early voting and comeys email gambit seems to have failed to sway voters to trumps camp 
meanwhile trumps own legal problems are beginning to overwhelm the narrative  and if there is any evidence of a clinton enthusiasm gap it exists only in bossies own head 
david bossie is living proof that clintons vast rightwing conspiracy is real and all the hating on hillary isnt going to change the fact that it is trump who is the crooked candidate not hillary clinton",2016-10-29
326,the media got suckered into buying the gops bogus clinton fbi email tale,"by jason easley on tue nov st  at  pm the more things change the more they stay the same the house freedom caucus is planning a secret meeting which in typical republican fashion was leaked to the press to discuss ousting paul ryan and demanding more ransom from gop leadership share on twitter print this post 
the more things change the more they stay the same the house freedom caucus is planning a secret meeting which in typical republican fashion was leaked to the press to discuss ousting paul ryan and demanding more ransom from gop leadership 
politico reported  one of the most pressing questions preoccupying washington is what the group will do about paul ryan the wisconsin republican has said he intends to seek another term as house speaker but has rankled members of the group of several dozen republican lawmakers that drove john boehner out of the speakership last year the freedom caucus is also weighing proposals meant to empower its members some at the expense of gop leaderships authority 
there have been early rumblings that speaker ryan may be open to making a few deals on policies like tax reform with hillary clinton if she wins the election one of the reasons why these deals may never happen is because of the ability of far right republicans to cause trouble 
if ryans republican majority shrinks he will be an even bigger hostage to the farright wing of his caucus the dysfunctional dynamic in the house is going to continue even if hillary clinton wins the election ryan has run into the same hurdles that john boehner faced house republicans are deeply divided and unable to agree on much of anything 
the fact that the freedom caucus is holding a secret meeting is a sign that nothing is going to change if paul ryan doesnt cave to their demands they will force ryan out of the speaker position 
a group of house republicans is plotting new ways to keep the house from working properly before a new president has even been elected 
this is a reminder that washington is fine its the republican party thats broken",2016-10-29

republicans are so far removed from reality that sean hannity spread a fake news story on his radio show and nobody noticed the difference 
cnn reported the progression of events illustrates how fake news stories expand and spread from fringe web sites to nationally syndicated radio shows with millions of listeners in this case the fake news originated on a dubious site called your news wire which publishes a mix of true slanted and madeup news then like a game of telephone by the time the story got to hannity even the fake facts were wrong 
some rightwing websites spread the story which turned into a tall tale that added new details at each stop the fake news eventually reached the gateway pundit and to sean hannitys radio show 
after spreading the fake news to millions of listeners hannity downplayed his responsibility to get the facts right bottom line it was brought up in an insignificant way i was dealing with more important issues like hrc crimes and lies and how cnn has been colluding with the clinton campaign and cheating bernie sanders 
hannity was busy dealing with real fake issues like hillary clintons crimes and how the election is being stolen from donald trump 
how hannity put a fake story on the air is a perfect example of how the rightwing media echo chamber works nobody at any level bothered to check the facts because in the republican party belief has replaced fact conservative media knows that their audience wants confirmation of their beliefs so that is what they provide 
it doesnt matter if the confirmation is true what matters is that the audience wants it to be true 
sean hannity is pushing fake news and he doesnt care 
this is why there is such a disconnect between republicans and the rest of the country republican voters are living in a fantasy land that donald trump was able to exploit and ride the whole way to the republican nomination 
the conservative media bubble is alive and well and because of this things will get a lot worse for republicans before they begin to get better",2016-10-29

tuesday evening trump made the case that due to the fbis announcement about clintons emails voters might have buyers remorse  a lot of things have happened over the last few days this is a message for any democratic voters who have already cast their ballots for hillary clinton and are having a bad case of buyers remorse  in other words you want to change your vote  wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think youve made a mistake 
while its true that people in some states can change their votes its not true that this rule was changed because of hillary clintons emails and yes thats a new right wing thing apparently trump doesnt suggest the law was changed because of clinton but he seems to think people will be rushing to change their mind about clinton because of the nonsurprise october surprise the republican fbi director delivered  which was perceived to have benefited the trump ticket 
days ago snopes debunked the notion that changing early votes is being allowed because of the fbis bizarre announcement that they may or may not have more emails pertaining to clinton 
claim after fbi director jim comey announced that he was reviewing emails potentially linked to hillary clinton several states announced that they were allowing people to change their early votes mixture 
whats true some states allow early voters to change their votes before election day 
whats false no states changed their election laws in order to allow people who voted early for hillary clinton to change their votes 
and to make this even better that false information was based on a fox news report that wasnt selling the false story about clinton but still got some of the information wrong this is why the right cant have nice things the left should be vigilant against allowing itself to become too insular because epistemic closure leads to losing 
trump conveniently ignores his own history of email dumping exhaustive list of lawsuits bragging about sexual assault dissing minorities and a gold star family and national security experts investigating his ties and his campaigns ties to russia 
only a desperate candidate runs on trying to get people to change their votes to him because someone found a clinton aides emails when they dont even know what they say or if they are duplicates yet 
while this race is far from over if all americans get off their butts and go vote donald trump faces an uphill battle to the white house",2016-10-29

speaking at reverend samuel delevoe memorial park in fort lauderdale tuesday night hillary clinton was interrupted by a donald trump supporter who shouted bill clinton is a rapist he was no doubt working for the  reward offered by infowars but clinton was having none of it rather than ignoring the man she issued a stern rebuke stabbing her finger at the man she said 
you know i am sick and tired of the negative dark divisive dangerous vision and behavior from people who support donald trump 
the man continued to shout waving his sign and the crowd countered with cries of hillary hillary as she said 
it is time for us to say no we are not going backwards were going forward into a brighter future 
the protester was escorted out by security and clinton told the man and everyone like him you may be angry about something but anger is not a plan dont be used dont be exploited 
see the protesters antics here note that he was neither roughed up nor attacked by clinton supporters 
sadly all too many angry white christians are allowing themselves to be exploited by donald trump who represents the very forces that have deprived them of the american dream a man whom as clinton says has taken everything and given nothing

ted lieu made the warning in a letter to us secretary of state john kerry and defense secretary ashton carter saying the us governments denial of target selection for saudi airstrikes in yemen does not excuse washington from legal responsibilities 
i find it deeply troubling that the us apparently has no advanced knowledge of what targets will be struck by jets that are refueled by us personnel with us tankers lieu said in his letter 
the us would appear to be violating loac laws of armed conflict and international standards by engaging in such direct military operations if us personnel are not aware if targets are civilian or military if the loss of life and property are disproportional or if the operation is even militarily necessary he noted a yemeni boy walks past a mural depicting a us drone and reading why did you kill my family photo by afp

the ongoing federal investigation into the clinton foundation was expected because of the clinton familys ties with us enemies says scott bennett a former us army psychological warfare officer 
the fbi has been probing possible paytoplay schemes at the family foundation for over a year now and is likely to press charges against it fox news reported wednesday citing informed officials 
bennett told press tv on friday that the probe was inevitable because of the metastasizing of the links and the connections that the clinton foundation had most specifically and grievously to saudi arabia to qatar and many other countries blacklisted by washington 
it was revealed on friday that the clinton foundation took a  million gift from qatar during hillary clintons tenure as the us secretary of state without her informing the state department 
hillary decided to not inform the department of the transaction despite signing an ethics agreement with regards to the foundation when she became secretary of state 
according to the foundations website qatar has so far given the clintons a total of between  million and  million over the years 
aside from qatar saudi arabia has also been one of the clinton foundations biggest donors it became known in  that the kingdom had given them between  million and  million 
so those terrorist entities which have been labeled as the enemies of the united states have been appearing as clinton foundation donors bennett said 
that is a serious crime it is treason it is corruption it is bribery of officials said the analyst 
bennett argued that all the leaks and investigations concerning the clinton family were coming from those personnel in the american government who have had enough 
they have stepped up they have released emails they have hacked into their own computers and in some cases they have provided it to wikileaks he added 
whistleblowing website wikileaks has released thousands of hillarys campaign chairman and top aide john podestas emails since last month exposing some of the wellkept secrets surrounding the clinton family and hillary clintons bid for the white house

we also think comeys nd letter which was intended to absolve sec clinton actually helped to bolster trumps turnout he continued

despite those challenges nayak said clinton was on course to win until the last week when everything changed and the momentum began to shift in favor of trump

professor fetzer made the remarks in a phone interview with press tv on monday days after republican presidential nominee donald trump stunned the world by defeating the heavilyfavored democratic candidate hillary clinton in the november  election 
during the election campaign trump repeatedly expressed his willingness to work with russian president vladimir putin and other leaders in order to resolve global problems including the issue of daesh terrorism which he has blamed on the policies of the obama administration

us defense secretary ashton carter told nbc news on wednesday that the pentagon is planning a ground offensive to oust daesh from the syrian city of raqqah the terror groups stronghold in the country 
carter who was in iraq earlier this week amid the ongoing battle to retake the city of mosul from daesh said the raqqah offensive would begin when iraqs second largest city is cleared

this is a ploy to have the us in northern syria petras said arguing that the us was seeking to undermine international efforts to defeat daesh in a bid to reinforce its own foothold in the conflictridden country

gordon duff a senior editor with the veterans today told press tv that james clapper who spoke out against former secretary of states emphasis on a nofly zone over syria is responsible because the american officials obtain their intelligence on the syrian conflict from the spy chief 
the public position of the united states visàvis syria was established based on intelligence supplied exclusively by james clapper duff noted adding he clapper is the one that talks about the gas hes the one who talks about the barrel bombs and everything thats been disproven 
he said every crazy scheme that the us comes up with to blame syria for killing its own people or the russians for slaughtering people in hospitals it all comes from james clapper the director of the national intelligence agency who fed that information to secretary clinton who fed that information to president barack obama 
clinton said that she favored a nofly zone only if acceptable for both russia and damascus and after negotiations which is a very different story than the one said by the spy chief for political purposes duff said 
duff added that the imposition of nofly zone obviously is going to help no one but alnusra front and isis daesh terrorists

the us has also been using bases in niger and djibouti but those ones are farther away 
efforts by the administration of president barack obama to access the airbase were meant to keep drones and small special operations teams within striking distance of the militants and close a blind spot for us and western spy agencies

sanders condemned trump after a report that the republicans presidential campaign has three voter suppression drives intended to lower turnout for hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee and to help trump winning the white house

the united states government is trying to distract people from the true nature of democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton by accusing russia of influencing the election against her 
don debar a new yorkbased author and radio host made the remarks in an interview with press tv on thursday following russian president vladimir putins response to washingtons accusations of sponsoring hacking attacks against the us 
speaking to foreign policy experts during a valdai discussion club meeting in sochi southern russia on thursday putin said washington was using russia as a distraction to cover the fact that this years white house contenders had nothing to offer on real issues 
the subject matter of what is being revealed here is definitely an action item that defines who clinton is debar said 
also the thing that is really galling is the fact that we are told to ignore the content and the content is something that goes to the heart of governing and also to the heart of clintons record the analyst noted 
this is the person who was married to the guy who signed in three strikes and you are out legislation for people to get life in prison if they are convicted of three felonies he said if you look at the things that have been revealed here some of the acts are themselves the violations of three separate federal criminal sanctions 
debar argued that clinton has multiple sets of the triple violations and yet is freely allowed to run for office under federal protection 
clinton and her campaign have repeatedly claimed that russia was trying to rig the november election in favor of republican nominee donald trump 
during the last presidential debate last week clinton accused trump of having secret ties with moscow saying that putin would love to see a puppet in the white house 
debar dismissed accusations against the russian president but noted that since the us was openly seeking regime change in russia it is only logical for russia to fight back

in every election the race tightens towards the end hoenig told press tv on thursday 
its really hard to imagine that there is any flux in this election as the supporters of both sides absolutely hate the other with obama and romney or even gore and bush many of the issues were shared and the voting was often done on personalities or the historical nature of a first black president regardless of who was pulling whose strings he said 
this election is more polarized than ever with the podesta leaks showing clintons overt racism calling donna brazille a buffalo as well as proving that president obama lied to the public about when he learned of clintons inappropriate use of her emails and with the news of trumps access hollywood tape receding into americas short term memory span its no wonder the polls are tightening the analyst stated

fakhrieh kashan emphasized that iran will not accept any clauses in trade agreements which he said foresee such possibilities like snapback sanctions and new sanctions against iran 
european businesses he said are in fact trying to devise deals in which political risks are inserted alongside commercial risks  what he said is totally rejected by the islamic republic 
if anyone needed guarantees against political risks it was iran fakhrieh kashan said in reference to the impact of western sanctions on the iranian economy 
why should iran accept very exceptional terms and conditions in its contracts with european companies this is not called a normal relationship he said

britain should not withdraw from the eu until it becomes clearer how brexit would impact uks economic social and cultural future blair said 
the bizarre thing about this referendum is that we took a decision but we still dont know the precise terms he said theres got to be some way either through parliament or through an election possibly through another referendum that people express their view 
the former premier who was in office from  until  said it should be possible for the public to switch their verdict if it becomes clear the alternative negotiated by prime minister theresa may is going to be worse 
blairs argument contrasts sharply with that of may who has repeatedly said that brexit means brexit and that shell respect the referendum result blair had argued that britain should stay in the eu before the referendum 
economic growth in the uk is expected to slow significantly next year due to uncertainty over of the brexit vote 
experts have warned that leaving the eu will severely hurt londons position as a financial hub unless the uk decides to keep its access to the single eu market by loosening its stance on immigration 
if the uk loses its access to the eus single market the resulting increase in the costs of doing business and exporting to the eu would hurt britains competitive position in europe loading",2016-10-27

the fourth high criminal court of bahrain has sentenced  political opponents to long jail terms and also revoked the citizenship of all of them while several international rights groups have criticized the al khalifa regimes harsh crackdown on the bahraini opposition the western powers turn a blind eye to the arab states violations of human rights 
edward corrigan an international human rights lawyer told press tvs top  program that the western powers are trying to whitewash the crimes committed by the arab dictatorships in the persian gulf region because such regimes are considered the wests lap dogs 
there is a double standard corrigan said explaining that western powers say if you are a friend of ours and do what we want and give us oil and invest your money into european or american economy we wont question your human rights violations 
according to the analyst there is hypocrisy double standards and this is really a big political game our dictatorships and allies are ok but somebody else that we dont like for whatever reason we magnify their crimes and even create false flags and do other things to try to discredit them 
elsewhere in his remarks corrigan said the definition of terrorism in bahrain covers any kind of opposition because the regime does not want to allow any sort of political movements there to try to reform the system to redress this massive discrimination against the shia population and to have any sort of voice for democracy so all of that is terrorism 
he added it is against the international law to remove peoples nationality from them and this is an extreme sort of punishment very draconian as theyre condemned by the international human rights organizations and other organizations

upon his arrival at vnukovo international airport in moscow on friday morning zarif said a political solution besides a serious fight against terrorism is the only way out of the crisis gripping syria 
unfortunately some countries have always pursued war and a military solution in syria this is while the solution to this crisis is of a political nature and also entails battles against takfiri groups said zarif 
he added we have always emphasized the need for the establishment of an allout ceasefire humanitarian operations and efforts to find a political solution to the syrian issue 
following the trilateral talks the three ministers attended a joint press conference

he said the washingtonled campaign was in fact encouraging daesh terrorists to move from iraqs mosul to syrias raqqah 
mosul and raqqah have served as the main daesh bases in the middle east over the past years iraqi and syrian armed forces are engaged in largescale military offensive to drive the terror group from the two cities

he said the global community must unite in the battle against terrorism which poses a threat not only to syria but the entire world 
zarif added that supporting terrorism would serve the interest of no one warning that the terror groups would eventually bite the hands that feed them 
for his part the russian foreign minister also touched on the mosul battle in iraq saying that iraqi citys liberation from daesh would have a significant impact on the balance of power in neighboring syria

454,sanders calls trump political coward over voter suppression report,"zero hedge october   
in the latest revelation sure to reignite accusations of collusion between the clinton campaign and the doj among the recent batch of hacked emails released by wikileaks we learn that the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october john podesta hillarys campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends including peter kadzik  who is currently a top official at the us justice department serving as assistant attorney general for legislative affairs 
peter kadzik with lobbyist tony podesta brother of john podesta  
the postbenghazi dinner was attended by podesta kadzik superlobbyist vincent roberti and other wellplaced beltway fixtures the first mention of personal contact between podesta and kadzik in the wikileaks dump is in an oct   email sent out by vincent roberti a lobbyist who is close to podesta and his superlobbyist brother tony podesta in it roberti refers to a dinner reservation at posto a washington dc restaurant the dinner was set for  that evening just one day after clinton gave  hours of testimony to the benghazi committee  
podesta and kadzik met several months later for dinner at podestas home another email shows  another email sent on may    kadziks son asked podesta for a job on the clinton campaign 
as the daily caller notes  the dinner arrangement is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of states email practices as one former us attorney tells told the dc the exchanges are another example of the clinton campaigns cozy relationship with the obama justice department 
the hacked emails confirm that podesta and kadzik were in frequent contact in one email from january kadzik and podesta who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
the political appointees in the obama administration especially in the department of justice appear to be very partisan in nature and i dont think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server says matthew whitaker the executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust a government watchdog group 
 its the kind of thing the american people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of hillary clinton  he added comparing the podestakadzik meetings to the revelation that attorney general loretta lynch met in private with bill clinton at the airport in phoenix days before the fbi and doj investigating hillary clinton 
kadziks role at the doj where he started in  is particularly notable kadzik as helped spearhead the effort to nominate lynch who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president 
a long friendly history 
podesta and kadzik have a long history one which has surprisingly gone mostly unnoticed during the ongoing clinton email scandal as dc helps summarize kadzik represented podesta during the monica lewinsky investigation and in the waning days of the bill clinton administration kadzik lobbied podesta on behalf of marc rich the fugitive who bill clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office 
that history is cited by podesta in another email hacked from his gmail account in a sept  email  which the washington free beacon flagged last week podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign podesta who would later head up the obama white house transition effort wrote that kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who  kept me out of jail 
as the dc chuck ross notes it is unclear to which case podesta was referring and whether he was joking about prison but podesta was caught in a sticky situation in both the lewinsky affair and the rich pardon scandal as deputy chief of staff to clinton in  podesta asked thenunited nations ambassador bill richardson to hire the yearold lewinsky  in april  the white house transferred lewinsky from her job as a white house intern to the pentagon in order to keep her and bill clinton separate but the clinton team also wanted to keep lewinsky happy so that she would not spill the beans about her sexual relationship with clinton 
richardson later recounted in his autobiography that he offered lewinsky the position but that she declined it 
podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by independent counsel kenneth starr for the investigation but he defended the falsehoods saying later that he was merely relaying false information from clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time he did lie to me podesta said about clinton in a national public radio interview in  clinton was acquitted by the senate in feb  of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the lewinsky probe kadzik then a lawyer with the firm dickstein shapiro morin  oshinsky represented podesta through the fiasco 
podesta had been promoted to clintons chief of staff when he and kadzik became embroiled in another scandal 
kadzik was then representing marc rich a billionaire financier who was wanted by the us government for evading a  million tax bill the fugitive who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism had been living in switzerland for  years when he sought the pardon to help rich kadzik lobbied podesta heavily in the weeks before clinton left office on jan   a house oversight committee report released in may  stated that kadzik was recruited into marc richs lobbying campaign because he was a longtime friend of white house chief of staff john podesta 
the report noted that kadzik contacted podesta at least seven times regarding richs pardon 
on top of the allhandsondeck lobbying effort richs exwife denise rich had doled out more than  million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon she gave  to hillary clintons new york senate campaign and another  to the clinton presidential library 
kadziks current role 
in his current role as head of the office of legislative affairs kadzik handles inquiries from congress on a variety of issues in that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the clinton investigation the justice department and fbi have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation which concluded in july with no charges filed against clinton 
but kadzik worked on other clinton email issues in his dealings with congress last november he denied a request from republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation  
in a feb   letter in response to kadzik florida rep ron desantis noted that kadzik had explained that special counsel may be appointed at the discretion of the attorney general when an investigation or prosecution by the department of justice would create a potential conflict of interest 
desantis a republican suggested that lynchs appointment by bill clinton in  as us attorney in new york may be considered a conflict of interest he also asserted that obamas political appointees  a list which includes kadzik  are being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as department of justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the democratic nomination for president of the united states  
it is unknown if kadzik responded to desantis questions 
kadziks first involvement in the clinton email brouhaha came in a sept   response letter to senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley in which he declined to confirm or deny whether the doj was investigating clinton last month politico reported that kadzik angered republican lawmakers when in a classified briefing he declined to say whether clinton aides who received doj immunity were required to cooperate with congressional probes

top nato  eu officials expressed anger at spains permit reportedly issued to a russian aircraft carrier group to take on fuel and supplies at ceuta a city with unclear political status spain says russias warships have been mooring there for years 
a barrage of harsh statements followed when spanish media reported that russias naval battle group led by aircraft carrier admiral kuznetsov would make a stopover at the autonomous port of ceuta after passing the straits of gibraltar on wednesday 
battle stations putins fearsome fleet locked loaded  ready for war with britain or not 
russian ships would moor in ceuta to take on fuel and supplies under a permit issued by spains foreign ministry spanish newspaper abc reported on tuesday also citing defense minister pedro morenes who said that there was a prior authorization for this particular case 
guy verhofstadt former belgian prime minister and currently eu envoy for brexit talks with the uk expressed his outrage calling spains decision the harassment of eu and nato forces 
in a facebook post he said that nato member spain provides assistance to a fleet which has one purpose adding that only last week this spanish government signed up to a statement from the european council accusing russia of war crimes against civilians in aleppo 
later in the day nato secretary general jens stoltenberg made it clear that the bloc wants madrid to rethink the stopover permit a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
we are concerned and i have expressed that very clearly about potential use of this battle group to increase russias ability and to be a platform for airstrikes against syria he said 
this is something i have conveyed very clearly before and i repeat those concerns today and i believe that all nato allies are aware that this battle group can be used to conduct airstrikes against aleppo and syria 
he then downplayed the rhetoric noting that its for each nation to decide whether these ships can get supplies and be fuelled in different harbors along the route towards the eastern mediterranean 
late tuesday night the spanish foreign ministry said it was reviewing the decision the latest stopover requests are being reviewed at the moment based on the information we are receiving from our allies and from russian authorities the ministry said in a statement quoted by reuters 
earlier in the day however the ministry told ria novosti that madrid allows russian ships to dock in spanish ports as routine navigation which effectively lies outside eu sanctions imposed on moscow 
in the meantime a spokesman for the foreign ministry told the telegraph the requests from the russian navy are considered on casebycase basis stressing that russian navy vessels have been making calls in spanish ports for years 
ceuta an autonomous spanish enclave on the tip of africas northern coast lies along the straits of gibraltar and borders morocco which also claims the territory as its own 
although ceuta is part of the eu its status within nato is still unresolved since  spain has rankled the bloc by allowing  russian warships to refuel at the enclave 
the mission of the admiral kuznetsov carrier group has already triggered a media frenzy across europe with british norwegian and dutch navies sending frigates and surveillance vessels to shadow the russian warships as they round european shores through international waters 
once they reach syrian shores the ships will provide backup for russias naval standing group already deployed to the area according to the russian defense ministry this article was posted wednesday october   at  am share this article",2016-10-27
463,syrian forces purge terrorists from town in hama province,"rt october   
around  civilians were killed in eleven airstrikes conducted by the usled coalition in syria which amnesty international investigated for its latest report amnesty says the us must come clean about the civilian toll of its fight against islamic state 
amnesty suspects that us central command centcom which directs coalition airstrikes in syria may have carried out unlawful attacks in syria failing to take necessary measures to prevent civilian killings 
we fear the usled coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in syria said lynn maalouf deputy director for research at amnesty internationals beirut regional office 
its high time the us authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in syria independent and impartial investigations must be carried out into any potential violations of international humanitarian law and the findings should be made public 
amnesty investigated evidence including eyewitness accounts reports by human rights organizations and the media photographs and video footage as well as satellite imagery related to  suspected coalition attacks in syria the group estimates that the attacks have claimed as many as  civilian lives so far none of these deaths has been acknowledged by centcom 
the report published on wednesday added that the total civilian death toll from coalition action could be as high as  or more than  since the operation against islamic state is formerly isis isil started in syria in  
one of the strikes investigated by amnesty took place in the early hours of december   the attacks hit two houses in the village of ayn alkhan near alhawl in alhasakah governorate in northern syria killing  civilians including  children and injuring at least  others the report said a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
according to an eyewitness account an initial night strike was followed by a second attack from a helicopter gunship which hit first responders trying to dig out survivors 
at this point i had a twomonthold baby boy in my arms whom i had rescued the hit caused me to fall and drop him i fell into the hole made by the air strike that was what saved me my mother aunt wife and children  a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed the woman and her son who id rescued were killed everyone but me was killed the survivor said 
the strike is believed to have targeted is fighters but local kurdish militia reportedly warned the coalition that there were civilians in the area 
amnesty said centcoms failure to acknowledge civilian deaths in syria as well as the poor record of investigating such incidents in afghanistan and iraq poses grave concerns over the toll which the civilian population of mosul iraq is likely to face from the ongoing operation to take the city from is the usled coalition is providing air support for the offensive 
given the likely increase in air strikes by the usled coalition as part of the iraqi offensive to recapture mosul it is even more pressing that centcom be fully transparent about the impact of their military actions on civilians and it is crucial that they adhere scrupulously to international humanitarian law including by taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and to minimize harm to civilian homes and infrastructure said maalouf 
a similar operation to capture manbij syria which is far smaller than mosul killed more than  civilians amnesty estimated 
last week amnesty international blasted russia for civilian deaths in aleppo the syrian city is divided between government forces and various armed groups including the alqaeda offshoot alnusra front russia says that the militants use civilians as human shields and would not allow them to leave the city derailing several attempts by russia to open humanitarian corridors out of the city this article was posted wednesday october   at  am share this article",2016-10-27

heres what i find interesting bees need to explain away partial birth abortion shows just how unpopular the procedure is shes trying to get rid of it not unlike a woman hoping to chop shop her unborn baby  of course she stops short of saying its a heinous evil thing for people to do to their own children by excusing the sick evil twisted women and the doctors who perform the butchery who make it happen sorry there is no reason to suck the brains out of a partially born baby for the health of the mother or if the baby has a terminal disease 
abortion is always wrong like always 
because chopping up a baby while its partially hanging out of the mother its head still in the birth canal because its going to die anyway makes sense if you agree with killing a baby like this for any reason youre sick probably a little bit evil read dear evil women who abort their babies yep that was written for you abortion supporters not sorry you might also like dear liberal women no getting an abortion is not brave this article was posted wednesday october   at  am share this article",2016-10-27

wikileaks continues to be a treasure trove of info about the behindthescenes rigging of what is turning out to be the most infamous presidential election in american history 
remember the first debate between hillary clinton and donald trump and the conspiracy surrounding podiumgate  
hillary required a specially built podium under the pretext that she didnt want to appear shorter than trump 
after the debate was over however a sneaky cleaner man was caught on tape approaching hillarys podium multiple times removing various items and looking as shady as possible while doing it what could also clearly be seen was what appeared to be a lit screen dimming specifically in her podium and not in trumps just after the debate officially ended 
this led to lots of speculation on whether or not hillary cheated during the first debate against trump and other debates as well having her comments fed to her 
well if the wikileaks podesta emails are any indication its very possible why a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
because apparently hillary cant give long speeches without a podium 
in fact these emails and this isnt even all of them but enough for you to get the picture prove her team is well aware of the fact that everything has to be kept short and sweet unless hillary has a podium 
so how are we supposed to believe she was able to speak at the minutes debates without prepared notes being fed to her somehow 
especially that final debate where she appeared to be reading more than writing looking down all the time at some sort of lit screen embedded in the podium as pointed out in other debates as shown in the video above this article was posted wednesday october   at  am share this article",2016-10-27

one of norways nuclear reactors was discovered to be leaking radioactive iodine monday morning according to the norwegian radiation protection authority nrpa  
in a statement released today the nrpa said 
the radioactive leak was due to a technical failure during treatment of the fuel in the reactor hall emissions are low 
experts say contamination levels around the institute for energy technology in the southern town of halden were well within legal limits and posed no risk to the public 
said per strand deputy directorgeneral at the nrpa a government regulator 
of course its an unfortunate situation but there is a low environmental risk this is not the sort of leak we want  
the radioactive iodine was a byproduct of the uranium which powers the facility 
staff were evacuated from the institute but later returned donning protective gear to assess the cause and extent of the leak and halt it 
a senior nrpa official said the incident would maybe be rated a  on the international nuclear event scale which rates nuclear incidents from  to  by comparison the incidents at fukishima and chernobyl were ranked   source the government of the hong kong special administrative region 
regulatory officials were frustrated that they were not notified about the leak until today  atle valseth a research director at the institute for energy technology agreed he said 
i dont sit so close to those decisions but i think we should have informed the authority yesterday we will have to go through why it wasnt reported  it wasnt good enough that we didnt report it yesterday  
strand the head of safety preparedness and environment at the nrpa expressed the regulators frustration 
we need to gather more information  but we are not happy with the situation that we were not warned immediately we will investigate further  
the swiss radiation safety authority srsa said i t has not detected any radiation emanating from the facility which sits close to the swiss border 
mark foreman a nuclear expert at the chalmers university of technology in sweden stressed that the vast majority of the radioactive iodine is trapped inside the fuel which is contained within a ceramic material the ceramicwrapped material is stored inside a metal tube that is welded shut the tube is inside the reactor 
the iodine would have to leak out of the reactor to enter the reactor hall

could we see violence no matter who wins on november th lets hope that it doesnt happen but as you will see below antitrump violence is already sweeping the nation 
if trump were to actually win the election that would likely send the radical left into a violent postelection temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before alternatively there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by hillary clinton and as i showed yesterday it appears that voting machines in texas are already switching votes from donald trump to hillary clinton  if hillary clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country 
at this moment there is less than two weeks to go until november th and a brand new survey has found that a majority of americans are concerned about the possibility of violence on election day 
a  majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on election day one in five are very concerned three of four say they have confidence that the united states will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked american democracy for more than  years but just  say they are very confident about that 
more than four in  of trump supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of clinton as president if she prevails because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square 
but many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence on wednesday donald trumps star on the walk of fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pickax 
donald trump took a lot of hits today and not just in the presidential race with less than two weeks to go before america decides if the ex apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over hillary clinton trumps star on the hollywood walk of fame was destroyed early wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pickax in what looks to be a tinseltown first 
and there were two other instances earlier this year when donald trumps star was also vandalized one came in january and the other happened in june  
this is of course not the first time the gop candidates star has been attacked or defaced since trump announced his white house bid in summer  the most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at  hollywood blvd in late january in june this summer a mute sign was painted on trumps star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign in both cases trumps star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day 
we have seen antitrump violence on the east coast as well earlier this month someone decided to firebomb the republican party headquarters in orange county north carolina on the building next to the headquarters someone spraypainted nazi republicans get out of town or else along with a swastika 
there have also been other disturbing incidents of antitrump violence all over the nation in recent days a recent lifezette article put together quite a long list and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece 
on oct  in bangor maine vandals spraypainted about  parked cars outside a trump rally trump supporter paul foster whose van was hit with white paint told reporters why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars all of this to make their statement 
around oct  a couple of trump supporters were assaulted in zeitgeist a san francisco bar after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for trump gotnews reports the two trump supporters were attacked punched and chased into the street by some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back lilian kim of abc  bay area tweeted a photo of the men in which one was wearing a trump tshirt and the other was wearing a blue lives matter shirt 
on sept  in el cajon california an angry mob at a black lives matter protest beat yearold trump supporter feras jabro for wearing a make america great again baseball cap the assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app periscope 
there is a move to get trump supporters to wear red on election day but in many parts of america that might just turn his supporters into easy targets lets certainly hope that we dont see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating 
of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad and a hillary clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge 
for example this week former congressman joe walsh said that he is grabbing my musket if donald trump loses the election 
former rep joe walsh appeared to call for armed revolution wednesday if donald trump is not elected president 
walsh a former tea party congressman from illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host tweeted on november th im voting for trump on november th if trump loses im grabbing my musket you in 
and without a doubt many ordinary americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case hillary clinton is victorious the following comes from usa today  
since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards hillary clinton ive been buying a lot more ammunition says rick darling  an engineer from harrison township in michigans detroit suburbs in a followup phone interview after being surveyed the trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election 
today america is more divided than i have ever seen it before and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another 
ironically donald trump has been working very hard to bring america together in fact he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any republican presidential candidate since   
if hillary clinton and the democrats win on november th things will not go well for hillary clintons political enemies the clintons used the power of the white house to go after their enemies the first time around and hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then 
and the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are this is something that i discussed on national television earlier this month  
as i write this it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a hillary clinton presidency would be 
but at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome  
out of all the candidates that we could have chosen the american people are about to put the most evil one by far into the white house 
perhaps donald trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate but time is rapidly slipping away and november th will be here before we know it  ",2016-10-28

wont you take pity on this poor innocent little child 
this image of a yearold migrant crying  which is currently plastered on the front page of the guardian  is nothing short of laughable 
a yearold from ethiopia cries while he awaits registration at a processing centre in the makeshift refugee camp near calais the photos caption reads the image is placed under a headline reading councils resist pressure to take children from calais 

this crying child is supposed to make brits feel guilty and demand their government allow children like him into their nation 
the image is not a fake nor is it being used satirically it comes from the associated press emilio morenatti  you can see four pictures of the man for sale on their website

498,why so few whistleblowers a former cia agents story,"is there any merit in taking a cynical view of life are the observations of cynicism realistic brave observations on human nature freed from sentimentality or are they only the somber commentary offered by one who is a loser at the game of life taking solace in his weakness and failure there are compelling arguments either way what is not disputed however is that françois de la rouchefoucauld was one of the most brilliantly cynical epigrammers who ever lived
it probably did not help that he came from a long line of noblemen for nothing so enfeebles the soul as much as inherited wealth and titles he was born in  and inherited the title of duke on the death of his father in  receiving the usual education of his class he dabbled in military matters in his teens various itinerant love affairs followed with wellplaced women but some of these ended badly we find him imprisoned in bastille for a week in  for political intrigue

although married he continued to pursue other women as was the custom of the time and his station marriages in those days were business affairs to be ignored at each partys pleasure or necessity one such dalliance resulted in an illegitimate child but the woman eventually rejected him for a more appealing competitor in  he found himself mixed up with a quasirevolt called the fronde an adventure that left him with impaired sight when he was struck with a musket ball in the head health problems also intervened to add to his misery in the form of gout and melancholy
in late seventeenth century france the paris salons were centers of debate discussion and the flowering of controversial ideas by now la rochefoucauld had acquired an acrid talent for stinging prose and he knew how to use it his failures in love and war had primed his spirit for a cynical view of life and this predilection meshed well with the taste of the salons for savage wit nothing is so shallow as sophistication
from his frequent visits to the salon of mme de sable in paris he had begun to piece together a body of epigrams that represented his worldview one of his peers had more commercial goals in mind for a bootleg collection of  of his sayings was first published without his permission and with no attribution in  two years later he finally put out a proper edition this contained  maxims the volume was titled sentences et maximes morales  but this is usually shortened to maxims 
there is a philosophy here it centers around the idea that all men are selfseeking egoists to a fault any virtue a man displays is only a smokescreen concealing his selflove our virtues are only vices in disguise human vanity takes precedence over nearly all else virtues are lost in selfinterest as rivers are in the sea even the nobler emotions like love and altruism according to la rochefoucauld are only a kind of traffic in which selflove ever proposes to be the gainer he took a dim view of women finding them fit only for love for men such as himself of course and procreation one of his crueler maxims was few womens worth lasts longer than their beauty

but lifes realities eventually caught up with him softening his rougher edges his wife who had cared for him in his infirmities for eighteen years died in  his mothers death followed two years later two of his sons would eventually die of injuries received in frances ruinous wars of the period
this gloomy picture was brightened by the entry into his life of the mme de la fayette who was twenty years his junior she invited him to stay with her in paris and he was carried there with difficulty she seems to have viewed him as a reform project she would later say that he gave me understanding but i reformed his heart perhaps his fame made him an interesting captive the union worked and seemed to alleviate his dark picture of humanity and when his final hours came he asked for and received the last rites of the church in 
a fair assessment of la rochefoucauld must take into account his undeniable wit his probing sensitivity and his ability to strip away the pretenses behind many human actions yet all in all his maxims are meager in result many of them are superficial and shallow the product of a personality still nursing the wounds of an early disillusionment we weary of his aphorisms after two or three pages and hesitate to reopen his book later
worse still he was wrong to say that virtue and altruism are shams nothing is more vital to life and we can see them around us every day if only we know where to look and as long as our senses are not blinded by fear timor animi auribus officit  as sallust says fear blocks out the ears

any bitter weakling can be a cynic but it takes depth of character to accept the worldsand mansfaults and foibles and to balance those against mans unquestioned capacity for greatness of soul broader life experiences might have corrected la rochefoucaulds errors but he preferred to remain in a state of arrested development while receiving the applause and notoriety of paris society his maxims can bring smiles to our faces as it is easy to find amusement in the flaws of others yet we forget that his barbs were directed at us as well
montaigne was far wiser for he took a balanced view of life accepting the worlds absurdities and joys with the equanimity and calm resolution of a greek or roman sage he was also a better man la rochefoucauld was intelligent without being wise and never found the confidence in himself to submit his ego to the consolatory power of a higher philosophical authority in any form cynicism in the end strips a man of his most important protective armor and leaves him naked to face the cruelties of life no cynic ever died a happy man

the latest batch of the podesta emails shared by wikileaks add a darker dimension if it was even possible to the sordid culture of corruption lies and depravity that surrounds hillary clinton explaining why the fbi has been calling her for quite some time now the antichrist personified  
it is a possibility that hellarys clique attends and organizes satanic rituals involving mockup scenes of cannibalism and sexual abuse involving children 
one of the emails directed at tony podesta john podestas brother contains the following sentence 

i am so looking forward to the spirit cooking dinner at my place 
do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining 
this really does not sounds like much until you discover the author of this invitation she who walks in the footsteps of the beast 
this is the woman who sent the email marina abramovic dressed in red and holding the skinned head of a dead goat a clear reference to the occult character baphomet 
there is proof that the clinton foundation directly transferred abramovic ten thousand dollars in at least one instance for her services abramovic carving a pentagram in the flesh of her stomach with a blade to show her artistic side 
a selfproclaimed artist abramovic hails from serbia and regularly organizes performances and events using what she calls spirit cooking 
this spirit cooking includes mixing semen breast milk urine or fresh blood before consuming it or splattering it over various things such as lifesized representations of young children like shown below 
this performance included spelling with the body fluids the following stanza 
with a sharp 
knife cut deeply into the 
middle finger of your 
left hand 
eat the pain 
other examples of her art nowadays any revolting expression of bad taste if sporting the correct pair of problem glasses include public dinners where politicians hollywood stars singers and decision makers gather to eat cakes that depict a naked human corpse or feast on the fake i hope by all that is sacred blood contained in a coffin where swims another human body celebrities that use demonic symbols in their persona such as lady gaga rush to participate to abramovics events another heavy user of the occult symbols jayz is a big fan of marina 
these codes are all directly copied from rituals such as black masses or sabat night reunions and popularized by figures such as aleister crowley from whom abramovic draws direct inspiration 
it is part of this growing phenomenon where the elites and celebrities close to power get caught intentionally or not showing symbols celebrating the ancient babylonian rites or the worship of the devil on november the th clinton chose jayz in a last bid to draw crowds to her empty rallies coincidence innocent children involved in that mess 
there is hard evidence that bill clinton traveled at least  times sometimes without his bodyguards it is all in the pilot logs to billionaire and convicted pedophile jeffrey epsteins island on board his plane dubbed the lolita express as it is in this plane that the guests could allegedly have sex with minors 
with this in mind it is disturbing to notice that other podesta emails refer to children as being the entertainment at pool parties almost entirely attended by middleaged men involved in politics other emails involve strange references to food such as pizza cheese  worth of hot dogs for a party that attendees dream of and recipes that many sources suggest are code words for orgies involving minors and extremely young children you can read more about it here  the whole clinton bag of crooks reeks of unnatural sexual behaviour and reproachable acts and we will certainly know much more in the days to come as hillary clinton is still under fbi investigation as we speak this follows the scandal surrounding huma abedin clintons right hand and confidant and her estranged husband sex offender and champion onehanded texter anthony weiner it will take some time before they go through weiners  emails and decide of a course of action regarding these dark revelations and other atrocities of the clinton crime family la plus belle ruse du diable est de vous persuader quil nexiste pas drawing by ben garrison 
these heavy accusations of satanism remind us of the sexual blackmail practices said to take place among the popular hiphop and hollywood communities as roosh described in his related article  or other rumours linked to suspicious reunions involving the secret ceremonies of the elite such as the ones of the bohemian grove or the rothschilds parties of the s 
if those recent speculations turn out to be true it could have the effect of a bomb and mean a revolution 
observe the symbols of cannibalism eerily similar in the three following pictures those are respectively a scene of the rothschilds surrealistic bal a painting hanging in john podestas office and one of abramovics dinners 
i will let you be the own judge of the conclusions inspired by those images my father is a very cartesian fellow and a saying of his comes to mind 
just like saint thomas

501,hillary cancels public appearance due to a large crowd of people chanting lock her up,"a gateway between western and eastern europe lies on the charles river in the czech republicprague its been a western tourist hotspot for many years now many people consider it a city overrun by the westerners ruined and no longer worth it
ive spent the last month of my travels here in prague and have had a good opportunity to contrast to a place further east ukraine 
with that being said here are  observations ive made about prague
 yes its overrun but 
that doesnt mean you cant find places that arent overrun yes if you choose to stay in prague zone  youre going to have a drastically different experience there will be hoards of people with selfie sticks and fat western girls wobbling all over old town blocking the already narrow streets
if you head out to prague    etc youll have a much different experience youll get to meet some locals try beer other than staropramen and avoid the throngs of tourists
of course its important to note that prague is a beautiful city its natural to want to see some of the sights if you choose to go this route theres simply no way around it
 the reaction from locals changes over time 
simply put locals are used to westerners and most of them roll their eyes at them however once they know that youve laid down some semipermanent roots theyre far more friendly
just the cashiers at the market below my apartment have done a complete  on me in the few weeks ive been here it went from a general coldness that they show all english speakers to genuine warmth
 the beauty of the city is unreal 
this is my third time in prague and im still blown away by how beautiful of a city it is from the castle to the riverwalks to all the colorful buildings its just a very pleasant place to be there are a lot of beautiful cities in europe but prague is definitely near the top of all of them
you cant really blame people for wanting to come and see it
 cheap by western standards expensive by ee simply put if youre looking for shortterm rentalsyoure getting hosed and theres not many ways around it prague landlords know the power of western currency and know that the shortterm stag parties dont mind blowing it
its far far cheaper to sign a lease for a   or  month period
a meal in a nice restaurant will probably run you between  usd this is incredibly cheap compared to places like italy spain or london at the same time its definitely a bit more expensive than places such as kiev budapest or some cities in poland
if you want actual numbers id say its about  more expensive than kiev probably about  more expensive than budapest the last time i was there was april  so keep that in mind and just marginally more expensive than poland
of course as i keep harping on this its going to get cheaper the further you go from the old town area
 the girls 
i know this is probably a large part of the reason youre reading this so lets break it down the girls are hot theyre not as hot as ukrainian and russian girls but theyre a step above polish women 
at this point its easy to see that any and all local czech girls living in prague are basically immune to foreigners you arent going to impress a girl by swooping in for a weekend and renting out a great pad with a view of the old town in fact shed probably rather do almost anything but hang out in that area
however being a foreigner will give you some major value if youre living there in colombia girls will bang you just because youre a foreigner in ukraine theyll probably at least give you one date for being foreign in prague theyll do neither especially the high quality ones 
however the same things apply if youre living there or coming back consistently
plus its not exactly rocket science to be higher value than the drunken tourists stumbling around just keep your liquor in check and avoid putting a gopro on your headyoull already be ahead of the game
 conclusionis it livable 
when you come from a place like ukraine prague feels much more like home the english is better and it has a more western feel you can find the larger supermarkets and other comforts that are often rare in the former soviet union countries ukraine belarus etc
the question is whether or not its worth it to deal with what comes with those western amenitieshigh amounts of tourism and a general feel of it being taken over theres no denying that prague has probably lost a lot of luster for the adventurous single man compared to how it was  years ago
however prague is definitely a good spot for a digital nomad to settle in and get some work done the internet is fast the city is interesting and there are good expat groups that put on cool things to do
you could do a lot worse

502,how a communist brainwashing method was exported to the united states,"a favorite trope of feminists and women claiming workplace discrimination is that female staff are the victims of sexism due to judgments about their appearance but how many times have we all seen girls working in our building or out on their lunch breaks in attire more befitting of a tinder date raunchy nightclub strip joint or even the gym meanwhile men must keep their fashion within a very narrow range of acceptability otherwise they risk failing to get that fancy new job or could lose their current one
furthermore guys learn to deal with the fact that the world does judge you based on your appearance many women have zero idea about this concept only accepting the judgments they agree with or those ones that further their interests and career for those opinions they dont like they can always conveniently claim the person giving them is sexist or misogynist or just as amorphously objectifying a woman this is classic attentionseeking
attentionwhore jayde phoenix
the epitome of this growing female narcissism is a british woman by the name of jayde phoenix  touting herself as a it security expert despite her academic and job credentials being a fraction of what it means to be highly qualified or plain nonexistent she suggested a guess the number of usbs in a jar competition to promote her company with her breasts nearly spilling out of a seethrough top she looked at the camera with a lustful gaze what many on the roosh v forum would call a thousand cock stare her clothes and demeanor better suited a street hooker than a professional
as we should have expected in our troubled times the many critics of phoenixs contrived appearance were labeled as sexists bullies and misogynists she herself tried to excoriate her detractors emphasizing how good she was at her job and the professional standards she supposedly meets every day but there are a few questions both the original photo exercise and her subsequent justifications failed to answer namely
if shes so good at her job why did she need to use a seethrough bra in the picture why doesnt she wear a top size that comfortably contains her breasts rather than flaunting them why is she and not someone else in the photo though the attentionseeking of jayde and her employer first flared up several months ago the dilemma of girls like her is an ongoing one
try getting employed in an office as a man with this sort of attire baggy pants with your underwear showing 
the male office worker could be wearing black pants and not jeans like in the photo and sporting a typical business shirt that doesnt matter no white collar company worth a dime is going to hire a man whose boxers or briefs are showing down to his ass compare this to the parade of female office workers who go beyond showing their arms and the hint of a bra strap to exhibiting half the surface area of their breasts in addition if you havent already noticed the very short crop top is now a staple garment within american office unculture it is not unusual to see a large part of a womans bare stomach and back including overthetop tattoos
hawaiian shirts and board shorts 
some workplaces most notably those trying to appear hip have drastically relaxed the need for business attire but these employers are definitely in the minority a man with a penchant for hawaiian shirts board shirts or other beach clothing will find his career options drastically limited as they should be the way in which you relate to your friends or fellow tourists on a holiday is almost always far different from how you should deal with clients investors stakeholders and the like in your profession men save their best or worst hawaiian shirt for office charity fundraising days company summer parties and related functions not an average day
leather lycra or ridiculously tight clothing in general 
inasmuch as tight clothing on men doesnt tickle your or my fancy its how ironic how an obese woman can wear garments twice or thrice as closefitting in the workplace than a fit male and male office workers of the world dont even consider wearing leather pants during your next boardroom presentation the occasional gay man or metrosexual might escape sanction for some outlandish or garish outfit but most industries if they value their reputation with clients will prohibit you from donning clothing that looks like it came from the wardrobe of lance armstrong or someone from queer eye for the straight guy 
excuses for female attentionseeking are out of control it seems that lady victoria hervey and jayde phoenix read the same book
there is little doubt that jayde phoenixs employer expected a backlash against her in this sense it was a very good marketing and advertising ploy for those prospective clients who do not care about actual professionalism of which there are many as for phoenix and other women like her this situation is winwin at the very least she and those of her ilk can continue their daytoday objectification of themselves generating desperately craved male attention in particular even for girls who do not receive the publics spotlight any roadblock or mishap in their career can later be blamed on misogyny after judgments about their appearance
at best as happened in phoenixs situation she gets nationwide and even global coverage for narcissistic girls who take zero responsibility for how others may negatively perceive them this is the coup of a lifetime yet as they age and jayde phoenix looks far older than her early s expect their antics to become more strawclutching and while these girls engage in sexual selfadvancement and wage war over imaginary discriminations the vast majority of male employees have no scapegoat they can use to rationalize their failures and virtually no means of combating institutionalized prejudice against their socalled privilege

504,donald trump and his supporters are fighting a rigged system,"via ap  
donald trump was elected americas th president tuesday an astonishing victory for a celebrity businessman and political novice who capitalized on voters economic anxieties took advantage of racial tensions and overcame a string of sexual assault allegations on his way to the white house
his triumph over hillary clinton will end eight years of democratic dominance of the white house and threatens to undo major achievements of president barack obama hes pledged to act quickly to repeal obamas landmark health care law revoke the nuclear agreement with iran and rewrite important trade deals with other countries particularly mexico and canada
the republican blasted through democrats longstanding firewall carrying pennsylvania and wisconsin states that hadnt voted for a gop presidential candidate since the s he needed to win nearly all of the competitive battleground states and he did just that claiming florida ohio north carolina and others
global stock markets and us stock futures plunged deeply reflecting investor alarm over what a trump presidency might mean for the economy and trade
a new york real estate developer who lives in a sparking manhattan highrise trump forged a striking connection with white working class americans who feel left behind in a changing economy and diversifying country he cast immigration both from latin america and the middle east as the root of the problems plaguing many americans and taped into fears of terrorism emanating at home and abroad
trump will take office with congress expected to be fully under republican control gop senate candidates fended off democratic challengers in key states and appeared poised to maintain the majority republicans also maintained their grip on the house
senate control means trump will have great leeway in appointing supreme court justices which could mean a major change to the right that would last for decades
trump upended years of political convention on his way to the white house leveling harshly personal insults on his rivals deeming mexican immigrants rapists and murderers and vowing to temporarily suspend muslim immigration to the us he never released his tax returns breaking with decades of campaign tradition and eschewed the kind of robust data and field efforts that helped obama win two terms in the white house relying instead on his large freewheeling rallies to energize supporters his campaign was frequently in chaos and he cycled through three campaign managers this year
his final campaign manager kellyanne conway touted the teams accomplishments as the final results rolled in writing on twitter that rally crowds matter and we expanded the map
the mood at clintons party grew bleak as the night wore out with some supporters leaving others crying and hugging each other top campaign aides stopped returning calls and texts as clinton and her family hunkered down in a luxury hotel watching the returns
at  am clinton campaign chairman john podesta told the crowd to head home for the night were still counting votes and every vote should count he said
trump will inherit an anxious nation deeply divided by economic and educational opportunities race and culture
exit polls underscored the fractures women nationwide supported clinton by a doubledigit margin while men were significantly more likely to back trump more than half of white voters backed the republican while nearly  in  blacks and twothirds of hispanics voted for the democrat
doug ratliff a yearold businessman from richlands virginia said trumps election would be one of the happiest days of his life
this county has had no hope said ratliff who owns strip malls in the area badly beaten by the collapse of the coal industry you have no idea what it would mean for the people if trump won theyll have hope again things will change i know hes not going to be perfect but hes got a heart and he gives people hope
trump has pledged to usher in a series of sweeping changes to us domestic and foreign policy repealing obamas signature health care law though he has been vague on what he could replace it with building a wall along the usmexico border and suspending immigration from countrys with terrorism ties hes also praised russian president vladimir putin and spoken of building a better relationship with moscow worrying some in his own party who fear hell go easy on putins provocations
the republican partys tortured relationship with its nominee was evident right up to the end former president george w bush and wife laura bush declined to back trump instead selecting none of the above when they voted for president according to spokesman freddy ford
house speaker paul ryan a reluctant trump supporter called the businessman earlier in the evening to congratulate him according to a ryan spokeswoman

505,more emotions men should master,"gentlemen donald j trump is the new presidentelect of the united states though a a few results may still be unclear trump has captured the perennial large battleground states of ohio florida iowa and north carolina plus georgia and in a change not seen in more than a generation he has seized pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin
pennsylvania and michigan have not voted for a republican presidential candidate since  and wisconsin since way back in  it appears also that states the democrats thought were well and truly in the bag for them such as minnesota maine and virginia have stayed blue with only waferthin or very disappointing margins the nd congressional district of maine a state which divides its electoral votes along with nebraska has been called for the republicans for the first time in nearly  years the last time any maine district voted for a gop presidential candidate was  when george h w bush seized all four electoral votes there
importantly too avowedly liberal states have seen significant turnouts for trump for example counts so far show that some  of voters in connecticut and rhode island states with even more liberal media bias than the nation generally have opted for the racist sexist and homophobic republican candidate their votes ultimately did not change the electoral college map but it is heartening to know that even in the eye of the liberal storm plenty of people are happy to support trump this is despite them facing fierce rebukes and often enough violence if they make their views public
the clown candidate has beaten  more experienced republican challengers and now hillary clinton the most elitebacked candidate in the worlds political history
as tonights results have shown plenty of trump voters in red and blue states alike have been forced to keep their beliefs quiet media airtime for protrump views and stories has been deliberately minimized and frequently demonized by the major networks mainstream journalists such as glenn thrush  wolf blitzer  jake tapper  jessica valenti  and brent budowsky have been caught collaborating with both the dnc and clinton campaign if you believe that these two groups are actually separate this only increases the esteem in which the emphatic resounding trump victory needs to be held
and lets not forget the senate and house races after months of spineless gop cucks rushing to differentiate themselves from trump the donald has still carried them to victory in both houses of congress  the white house senate and house of representatives are all in republican hands until at least the  house midterms can you taste the very salty tears of the liberals and sjws yet
every powerful vested interest not only supported hillary but did everything they could to ruin trump yes its happening
did you see the last major hillary clinton rallies celebritiescumpolitical hacktivists chief among them lady gaga beyoncé jay z bruce springsteen bon jovi and katy perry all fell into clintons corner well before their final appearances for her excoriating anyone who had the gall to support donald trump even longterm republicans who betrayed trump like arnold schwarzenegger were attacked by celebrity sjws such as robert deniro after they joined the never trump ranks as if they were dangerous saboteurs the celebrity paranoia has been palpable for months hollywood that broad industry taking in not just film stars but also singers silver screen actors and comedians has become little more than an overpaid trade union for hillary clinton
likewise every major american company that has come out for a candidate has come out for hillary plenty of neutral corporations have undoubtedly been funneling support to the clinton campaign behind the scenes as well prominent billionaires like george soros and warren buffett have done all they could to drag hillarys stumbling halfcorpse both literally and figuratively across the line whilst trump has been supported by a number of tenfigure businessmen these men are regularly attacked in the media they include the scapegoated but brave peter thiel and carl icahn
and then theres the mainstream media countless studies have indicated that about  of all journalists are liberal this overrepresentation is more salient still in the upper echelons of newsmen and women particularly prominent mastheads such as the new york times  washington post  and huffington post  plus democratic tv surrogates like cnn and nbc the  campaign has inflated this preexisting liberal bias one that plagued the two george w bush administrations but raged even more ferociously against donald trump over the last  months
all of these media elites have lambasted trump for over a year at the same time they give the paltriest coverage of the disgusting hillary podesta and dnc emails everything newsworthy on this front from the overwhelming presence of clinton foundation donors in hillarys secretary of state diary book to more recent revelations about john podestas involvement with satanic rituals has been brushed off the balcony by the wolf blitzers and chuck todds of the american mainstream media yet trump has triumphed nonetheless
the new administration must crush the criminal democratic elites and clinton foundation with the rule of law will hillary now find herself stumbling into jail
inasmuch as the clinton campaign the sjws and their big business and media enablers have been defeated in this years election they retain very welloiled and effective means for trying to undermine president trump once he takes office trumps first priority as commanderinchief must be to remove the bureaucratic apparatchiks preventing a full and frank investigation of the clinton foundation he also needs to clear the way for legal inquiries into the various criminal activities as uncovered by wikileaks perpetrated from within the dnc and hillary clintons campaign
the department of justice in particular has engaged in all manner of skulduggery most notably when attorneygeneral loretta lynch had a private meeting with bill clinton during the most crucial time of the fbi investigation into hillarys emails additionally elements of the state department illegally informed hillary about new developments in that same case enough is enough its time to drain the swamp
election night produced another curveball after weeks of calling donald trump a sore loser for him not saying if he would respect the final result hillary clinton refused to speak to her supporters and the american people it would seem that she only telephoned trump privately so whos the sore loser now
last night we were witnesses to the greatest electoral seachange in americanand perhaps globalhistory we cannot lose sight of the work to be done but for the next  hours we can bask in this unprecedented victory against all odds

506,the most important concepts the manosphere taught me,"firearms panics happen over a variety of things like acts of domestic terrorism mass shootings or democrats getting elected to office though we may not have to worry about this for a few years after nd amendment enthusiast donald trumps decisive victory last night lets cover our bases and talk about a panic if future democrats are elected
what is a panic for ammo and firearms a panic is when people go and buy items just to have them because they are worried that there will soon be no more or it will be illegal to buy and sell such items but maybe not to own them already as most americans still believe in the no ex post facto laws part of the constitution
adding to a panic is speculators who buy from retailers who are roundly shamed if they raise their own prices only to resell privately at much higher levels while this is legal it certainly isnt ethical or a decent thing to do and these folks deserve being shamed and mocked at every opportunity
lastly the gun stores or sites inventory cannot handle the flex in the buying demand nor can the manufacturer and an artificially contrived panic creates a real scarcity that can only be corrected by the panic running out of steam as everyone buys what they consider to be enough and natural undercutting resets the price back to lower levels
some prices never return  long rifle ammunition has still not totally recovered from the damage old brock the islamic shock obama did to it with his multiyear championship of best firearms salesman ever and it may be even worse under the bitch in chief
so what gets grabbed in a panic what should you get what should you count on still being available weve got three categories guns ammo and componentsaccessories
guns anything thats big on the liberal hit list is a first target for a ban so its a first target for a panic look for things that are popular with the right and scary to the left also look for things that are modern no one is going to ban the m garand anytime soon
evil features matter more than destructive power anyone who knows anything about guns knows that the ak and the ar fire intermediate cartridges that are puny enough to be considered inhumane in several states with which to hunt deer as they lack the power to kill the animal with marginal shots however theyre black and have mean things attached to them so theyre on the shit list while a nice blued with wooden stock scoped bolt action rifle in a magnum cartridge capable of wrecking your world from twice the distance that an ar can pull is safe as it looks traditional

they have to be popular to the left to get noticed rifles like the fal and anything based of the ghk action simply dont have enough exposure to get targeted unless they pull something sweeping like the usc  r rules again the mini  and the ma might be safe maybe
for pistols pretty much any semiautomatic of the polymer age is fair game to want banned oftentimes stupid rules like restrictive magazine sizes get pushed s hi powers other old domestic semiautos and revolvers should be safe expect the libtards to go after glocks and the like
shotguns seem to be immune these days as theres not a whole lot of difference between a hunting gun and a combat gun other than paint and mag tube length i think the saigas are still not being imported and its about the only box mag fed one out there but anything else makes a good home defense gun that should also be immune to the ammo panic portion as well
ammunition range full metal jacket and defensehunting hollow or soft point cartridges in popular centerfire calibers and  long rifle will almost literally evaporate from your local store and online and its probably beginning as i write this
oddly enough only certain rounds will suffer panic buying for rifles its limited to   and  traditional hunting rounds like   and  do not seem to be impacted why doesnt  get bought in a panic as the old joke goes men with s dont panic but it really has to do with the feedback cycle i mentioned at the start if theres little demand it cannot exceed the instore supply so the perception of it being gone for good cannot occur
everything but the shotgun shell and the howitzer round to the far right will sell fast in a panic
panic bought pistol ammo is the big  mm luger  sw and  acp  will round out the affected semiautomatic rounds and there usually is a bit of a run on  magnum and  special as well mm  sig  gap and other magnums like the  do not seem to be affected
for rimfires  long rifle just goes poof while its magnum brother and smaller  caliber cousins do not seem to be as affected rimfires are not reloadable and this contributes to their overstockpiling
components and accessories most centerfire ammo is reloadable and the serious amongst shooters will roll their own for economy selfreliance and performance so the consumable components will also get some panics although ive held off on reloading articles until i get my press set back up we can hit up the components that will get panic bought briefly

biggest thing is primers even bigger than the bullets oddly enough the primer is the little metal cup that gets smacked by the firing pin and sets off the powder in modern cartridges and they come in two sizes for pistols two for rifles and of varying hardness to satisfy military specifications
the second is gunpowder itself fortunately theres a wide variety of smokeless powder and everyone tends to have the brands and formulas they prefer so it takes a little less of a hit than the primers the third is the bullets and since there are so many types and manufacturers they also take a little less of a hit than primers while you obviously need all three to reload bear that in mind always save your brass and anyone elses you can pick up
even though the little ones are easier to use the higher capacity ones disappear first get both
while it is always a good idea to have spare springs and small parts like firing pins and extractors that are prone to breakage the number one accessory or part to take a hit in panics is the box magazine especially high capacity ones i dont mean the  round drum mags although those do take a dive nor do i really mean the  round coffin mags but i mean the full capacity full sized pistol mags like a  round mag for a full sized pistol or a  round ar mag expect to see pmags and surplus style aluminum ar mags just vanish the gabby giffords special the extended glock   round mag is also a contender for vanishing fast in a panic
holsters slings cleaning accessories optics and ammo cans seem to be immune from panics
what to do if you already own a carbine andor a semiauto pistol make sure you have enough ammo magazines and spare parts its a lot better to have one gun with multiple mags and a lot of ammo than many guns with the one or two mags with which they came from the factory and a couple boxes of ammo
i try to have at least six mags for my semiauto pistols and at least ten mags for my semiauto rifles get some rifle mags of different sizes the  and  ar mags are fun for shooting standing up but they get in the way of prone firing and the  and  rounders are preferable
your ultimate ammo goal i maintain should be a thousand practice rounds and  defense rounds for each gun you have but in a prepanic or panic situation just get what you can at a normal price some is better than none if youre into reloading you know what to get already
if you dont own anything and want to soon refer to some pistol articles  a rifle article a shotgun article and a buying guide here consider buying some stripped ar lowers to build on a rainy day later on
build an ar and meet girls at the range
conclusion no matter who got elected i think this country is in for rough times its always better to have firearms and not need them then not have them and need them store yours safely but accessible and ready in times of need

508,the wisdom books of the old testament," things america can learn from hungarys resistance against the migrant masses  things america can learn from hungarys resistance against the migrant masses 
the paprika plutocrat is a spicy capitalistic hungarian blogger follow his unyielding assaults against cultural marxism on his blog paprikaplutocratcom november   politics 
on the  nd of october hungary has seen a stunning manifestation of national unity as  of votes cast on a referendum regarding the euimposed migrant settlement quotas were declared a strong and undebatable no now the hungarian national parliament works at incorporating the referendum results as an amendment to the countrys constitution while some leftwing news outletslike the guardiancelebrated the supposed inadequacy of the referendum it is beyond dispute that the message of the voting is strong and firm 
here are five lessons we can learn from this monumental stand against globalism  democracies need strong leaders 
wimpy western politicians would have their voters believe that personality does not matter strong witty and masculine politicians are often depicted as exponents of a fascistic personality cult nowadays it seems not much distinction is made between being a macho and being a nazi 
in reality all great western democratic leaders were strong menand sometimes women winston churchill charles de gaulle david bengurion ronald reagan and margaret thatcher were not known for being timid politically correct politicians who would retract and apologize for every past comment that theyve made do you think that todays eu politicians and western leaders could have beaten hitler or won the cold war 
hungarys viktor orbán might have some faults but he is certainly not a shy and weak politician who lacks magnetism even his opponents will grant him that he has a rare political talent and an almost visionary skill for seeing future happenings think of how one year ago hungary was the first european country to build a wall to keep the migrant wave out today most countriesfrom austria to great britainfollow his lead 
just listen to his  th march  speech made on hungarys national holiday commemorating the countrys  freedom fight against the habsburgs look at how he is standing in the rain without some guy holding an umbrella over his head this man has speaking skills grand views and balls 
the idea that western democracies can function with leaders who have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a lowgrade bank clerkto quote nigel farage who has so sharply put it to herman van rompuyis a lie and has no foundation in reality democracy is about the masses the masses need inspiration and leaders democratic leaders therefore have to be strong and need game themselves 
i am personally a friend of monarchies and i have libertarian arguments for it but as long as the western world believes in democracy we cannot have cucks and wimps protecting it  liberty is protected by the rightwing 
anyone who believes in game enjoys the fruits if western liberal capitalism like it or not yes the modern world has its faults but freedom of speech freedom of sex life freedom of entrepreneurship and freedom of travel are all essential parts of our lifestyle of course these are tenets that the left hates today in fact if you want to live free and live a masculine lifestyle the liberalism of today is certainly not your friend 
therefore im going to write about liberty and not liberalism one can debate the difference between these terms in short what i mean is that the left today doesnt want you to be free but wants a politically correct nanny state to control and plan every move you make and punish you if you do not oblige 
the right however still stands for the basic concept of personal liberty that we have grown to love and respect hungary has been criticized a lot by leftwing groups for having curbed some freedoms i will agree that some of these state actions were unnecessary and hardly defensible but hungaryand easterneuropetoday still has more freedom than some corners of the ohsoliberalandtolerant western world 
in hungary universities rarely propagate the debased agenda of social justice wars cultural marxism is regularly attacked and barely tolerated feminism is rare and marginal and the country is overwhelmingly conservative and right wing the governing party with twothirds of parliamentary seats is centreright the largest opposition party is openly farright in the capital city of budapest one of the best and cheapest cities for nightlife and gaming in europe you will certainly not be prosecuted for stopping hot girls and asking for their numberunlike some western cities  minorities are misled 
the hungarian pressmuch outside of the view of the grand world due to our rarely known and complicated languagehas been in throes for the past few months about the migrant crisis like most eastern european countries hungary barely has any immigration or muslims in fact if theres a black person on the street people will often turn their heads 
debates that have been present in the western mediaabout muslim integration terror and islam palestine and israel have only recently surfaced in the hungarian press minorities of course have been misled by the leftwing press into believing that the migrants were refugees poor victims whom he have a responsibility to assist the jewish press meaning official jewish congregation organs not conspiracy theories and lgbt groups voiced their concern for tolerance and nonviolent communication 
it is probably not a grand revelation to most readers of this site that muslim immigration brings little good to minorities as milo yiannopoulos said in a lecture of his the muslims are not on top of the oppression ladder but they want to kill all the others on the oppression ladder minorities have been misled into following the agenda of the political left the sight of hungarys gay public personalities demonstrating for letting in muslims in front the parliament is a clear proof of this  feminists love islam 
feminism in hungary is a rare bird but it does exist one such radical marxistfeminist made the news when she openly argued that there could be no terrorists among muslim refugees this of course was before the paris and brussels attacks many of the perpetrators of which arrived as refugees through hungary a few days ago i stumbled across the facebook page of another fine specimen this hardly attractive girl celebrated the empowerment of the hijab which according to her was a beautiful expression of females voluntary decision to defy the dating market 
describing such violent and shameful oppression of people as voluntary selfempowerment is crazy feminists live in denial of facts and the recent alliance between crazy radical islam and marxist feminism only proves that neither has any love for western culture  eastern europe is still ok 
the western media gleefully celebrated the fact that with a voter turnout of a little more than  the  limit of required turnout was not reached according to hungarian laws however a referendum with  or more electorate turnout is valid even if not politically binding the hungarian government will soon amend the constitution to declare that brussels cannot force the country to take in immigrants without the consent of the people 
such a policy is clear and sound the message is that eastern europewith all its faults economic lagging and sometimes real intoleranceis still a better place to live for masculine men that many a place in the western world here masculine lifestyle is appreciated donald trump has grand supporteven viktor orbán voiced his good wishes for the republican presidentelectand feminism has failed to win any serious ground 
eastern europe is still not lost and hungary is certainly among the best options for men of game today",2016-10-28
509,myths that men believe about southeast asia,"there are some things that we have learned about the united states from this election well need to keep these in mind as we make efforts to return sanity to society
the federal government has been corrupted probably the most shocking lesson of this election is that the entire federal government has been coopted to serve a single partythe democrats the best example of this was the behavior of fbi director james comey the fbi is part of the executive branch of government so comey reports to loretta lynch who in turn reports to obama despite this fact one expects that the fbi be allowed a high degree of discretion to honestly investigate individuals regardless of which political party they belong to after all the us was founded upon the idea that we are all equal before the law
comeys actions reveal that the fbi has thrown equality before the law out the window at first the fbi investigated clintons use of an unsecure personal email server to conduct national business while she was secretary of state but even though clinton apparently violated several laws that have gotten other people severe jail sentences comey exonerated her back in july with a hand slap
in a move that surprised everyone comey reopened on october th the criminal investigation of clinton after  emails state department emails were found on pervert anthony weiners computer trump supporters rejoiced and hillary supporters expressed outrage but the white house calmly called comey a man of integrity did they know something we didnt
it turns out the fix was in from the beginning because just  hours before election day comey exonerated clinton again  the fbi director likely intended to clear clinton of wrongdoing before the election to defuse donald trumps criticism of her
the big lesson is that the law is applied selectively wealthy politicallyconnected people dont need to play by the same rules as everyone else unless this situation is corrected it means the rule of law is deadand that is a very grave lesson indeed
the elites are in control but elites want you to believe they are super smart and super powerful like the great oz
ive written many times about the control that globalist elites exert on the country through their control of the media educational institutions and politicians through the form of bribes donations cushy job offers speaking fees by controlling the flow of information and setting the narrative the globalists are able to control the masses like cattle the good news is that their control is not complete they are not omnipotent
the weakness of the elites has been demonstrated in three ways the first was with the brexit vote when prime minister david cameron agreed to hold a referendum on the uks membership in the eu he never dreamed that britons would actually vote to leave all the polls at the time showed that any movement to leave would go down in flames still through the work of men like nigel farage and boris johnson the british populace voted to leave the eu the brits on the leave side had to endure being called racist and look past polling that said they had no chance to win
the second way was the campaign of trump himself the gop had planned a coronation for jeb bush the rest of the gop field was me too candidates who were virtually indistinguishable from jeb trump came in with an uncompromising message and crushed jeb and the rest of the little jebs the elite plan to have hillary versus a weak conservative was completely thrown into disarray by trumps campaign even if trump has lost the general it is still a victory because now instead of seeing the great oz we see the globalists behind the curtain
the third manifestation of the weakness of the elites is the rise of the alt right a tiny group of young people on the internet was able to quickly wake up large segments of the population only a year ago terms like nationalism and globalism were rarely heard in the us now we have grandmothers in texas tweeting about how we need to lay the axe to the globalists
the overall lesson is that we should not fear the globalist elite they exist and they are able to fool a majority of the population but not all of us with sound strategy they can be defeated
the elite have completely divorced themselves from nonelites 
in the past europe had an aristocracy this aristocracy had a close relationship with the rest of the people in the country the aristocracy was expected to defend the nation in case of war they also had the same religion as the rest of the country we already knew that the modern aristocracy of the globalist elites has no responsibilities toward the rest of us but thanks to wikileaks we have now learned that they dont even share the same religion
wikileaks revealed that hillary clinton and her campaign manager are close friends with marina abramovic a serbian artist who performs occult rituals she calls  spirit cooking  spirit cooking appears to be set of magical rituals that use bodily fluids such as menstrual blood urine and semen to achieve certain goals usually sexrelated it also involves at least minor sacrifices one recipe calls for cutting ones figure and eating the pain
while spirit cooking is certainly grotesque it is not my intention to focus on it except to point out that it has become a sort of initiation ritual into the us globalist elite hillary clinton john podesta jayz and beyonce lady gaga and gwen stefani have all attended these rituals and i would not be surprised to learn that many other politicians ceos and bankers also participate getting invited to one of these spirit cooking sessions means that you have gained entry into the wealthy elite in the us there are probably similar groups or rituals for the modern day european elites
there are several things at work here most of the spirit cooking participants probably dont believe in the efficacy of the spirit cooking ritual it is more like a college fraternity initiation it only means something in terms of ones social standing also the satanic imagery of spirit cooking and its sexual overtones are big middle fingers to christianity which our elite regard as the religion of the unwashed masses
in both of these ways our modern elite have separated themselves from the rest of us they dont share the same destiny as us if the country starts going to hell the wealthy elite can just pick up and move to another country or they can live in small heavily guarded compounds untouched by the damage their policies have caused and they even lack a common morality with us in their own eyes their wealth has somehow put them beyond the traditional moral code that guides the rest of us
the fact that the elites have no regard for the rest of the country does not bode well for them the aristocracy of old knew that their fortune was bound up with that of their countrymen the modern elite lack this wisdom once enough of the hoi polloi realize it it is only a matter of time before these pseudoelites are deposed from their pedestal
conclusion with trumps election the problem of federal government being used for political purposes will be mitigated however the problems with our indulgent pseudoelite will continue to be a force that prevents the patriarchy from returning in any case we can be grateful that the election of  has exposed some of the cancers that are eating away at our society

510,ridiculously stupid things men keep doing for women,"why socalled intellectuals do more harm than good to society why socalled intellectuals do more harm than good to society 
andré is a young european who left his decaying country in  for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november   culture 
the existence of intellectuals is more ubiquitous today than ever many are those who contend for public attention credibility and money as a reward for their wits not to mention the very status of intellectual yet the existence of such people is far from selfevident for centuries traditional societies barely had anything or anybody that looked like modern intellectuals and this did not prevent them from lasting hundreds or even thousands of years 
so as we elaborate projects and ideas for reforming the depraved societies of the empire of nothinga necessary step if we want a lasting victoryan important question must be confronted do we need at all what has been called intellectuals during last centuries and if we do not what should we have instead the origin of modern intellectuals 
at the heart of modernity lies a deep crisis before it western europe was united by the same christian faith and a basic agreement on the place of economysubordinated to guilds and the rights of the average producer 
when modernity reared its philosophical head through rené descartes a prominent thinker of the seventeenth century the old continent was in a much more problematic state christianity had splintered into various opposing faiths whose intellectual opposition was shaking everything to the core we have been told that the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were a glorious new flourishing of intelligence but in fact thinkers who actually lived at this time had quite a different impression 
the irish bishop george berkeley  criticized how the practice of philosophy had become on his age synonymous with getting embroiled into thousand scruples prejudices and errors of sense a situation he attributed to the wrong use we make of our faculties likewise the scottish philosopher david hume  scolded his contemporaries for being too eager to criticize the systems of others for the sake of pushing their own on the scene that is a mutual hypercriticism that led to a general lack of certitude about everything 
there is nothing which is not the subject of debate and in which men of learning are not of contrary opinions the most trivial question escapes not our controversy and in the most momentous we are not able to give any certain decision disputes are multiplied as if everything was uncertain and these disputes are managed with the greatest warmth as if everything was certain amidst all this bustle it is not reason which carries the prize but eloquence from hence in my opinion arises that common prejudice against metaphysical reasonings of all kinds 
the first precursors were honest in their endeavour to solve the crisis descartes berkeley hume and many others genuinely sought a grand encompassing theory that could resume with all controversies but soon the very controversy became an institution a whole market of ideas was growing in which more and more lettrés started to see an opportunity to make a name thus earning fame social standing and sometimes money hume could not help himself soon after criticizing those who fed the crisis by attacking the others systems while promoting their own he was doing the same 
such was the socalled enlightenment the further undermining of any spiritual philosophical or cultural unity by ambitious individuals ready to hustle for notoriety they would be experts at flattering the powerful mocking the catholic church fiddle fashionable themes and witty prose and more than everything else rationalizing their activity as a progress the very expression enlightenment stems from their willingness to market themselves to the posterity the intellectuals bread and butter 
it can be noted that from the amateur gentlemen of the eighteenth century generations of scientists have sprang up some of these characters were mathematicians engineers doctors or dedicated observers of nature and they all contributed to improving general human power over matter  but make no mistake even science needs problems and unknown stuff to justify careers and research thus following a headlong rush dynamic at its side the literary intellectuals need more problems so they can have the opportunity to sell themselves through claiming they want to solve them 
the momentous crisis turned into a crisis structure and the structure turned into a mark of the modern west where god ceased to speak the modern talking head took more and more territory and wrote dozens of books trying to prove he was the embodiment of progress it doesnt matter if problems are genuine or artificial intellectuals need them like a blacksmith needs iron 
two typical intellectual characters are voltaire and émile zola both were gifted writers both were charming and witty both managed to write about matters that were actually relevant to their times and both have used a trial with political overtones to make a show of themselves not so incidentally both were french and participated to the furthering of a twisted literary chauvinism 
voltaire took advantage of various trials to claim that the defendants were accused because they were protestants inside a catholic country the infamous affaire calas  from the name of a father who was accused of having murdered his own son was used by the shrewd philosophe to sending pathetic letters to the upper crust of the society stirring the public opinion pressuring magistrates until the fatherwho had been convicted and executed after a thorough investigationwas rehabilitated two centuries and a half later young frenchmen are still taught voltaire was a champion of truth justice and reason whereas he was more like a playwright who peddled influence 
zola more than a century later did the same a jewishfrench captain alfred dreyfus  was convicted for high treason after he allegedly communicated secret documents to prussia years later some new evidence seemed to indicate that dreyfus was innocent and that another officer had leaked the documents at this very moment zola published an incendiary article jaccuse  where he spat on the judges and cried about the injustice of the affaire  eventually dreyfus was rehabilitatedand the army the patriots and the catholics were shamed through a neverending media discourse that casted them as villains of the whole story 
voltaire and zola played the same role in a narrative of the exact same kind we are taught about a situation of injustice where the majority of the population is oppressing an innocent group through an innocent individual and crooked institutions fortunately a heroic talking head rises miraculously converts the opinion to recognize the poor innocent victim as such the talking head is crowned as an awesome thinker beyond boundaries whereas some are fairly vilified as oppressors and the poor victims rehabilitation is also the victory of reason justice and progress 
thus the intellectuel in the most typical sense is a highly paradoxical creature who becomes taught in classes after having seemingly rebelled against dominant institutions teenagers are led to think that heroic and highly intelligent individuals can turn the tide of unfavourable opinion provided they follow a mysterious sense of history there have been a lot more intellectuals than the mere classics and often those rejected by the official narrative are more interesting than those inside whos gonna pay 
even if you are gifted with words and language being a talking head does not pay much would anyone be ready to pay you for giving an opinion no matter how elaborate on anything the problem of money is a good starting point to connect the dots voltaire was close from wealthy protestants bankers one of whom even helped him to obtain a house in geneva and zola was a rotschild protégé  both of them contributed to tarnish catholicism and most of their own people in other words they served interests that could pay themthey were sellouts 
today some bloggers happen to earn money as independents especially when they found themselves a niche yet independence is scarce way too many people would like to live from their wits and even more obtain recognition as intellectuals more than often intellectual types turn into teachers journalists or even marketersthus depending upon an institution that pays them 
in north america the war against whites and masculinity is massively subsidized  whether in the academic or in the media you wont easily find a job there if you take a critical stance on cultural marxism and in case you wouldnt be selfhating enough they are already replacing you with minority individuals who are rewarded for spewing wordy venom daily 
old marxism was wellaligned with the interests of intellectuals as a class not as individuals it handed them an official status and flattered their ego by casting them as the vanguard of progress keynesianism triumphed for the exact same reason as it justified the creation of a bloated state where modelobsessed nerds enjoy a tremendous power over those who produce actual wealth intellectual types historically joined the left because it gave them a status money and moral recognition 
but the whole marxist vocabulary of progress and emancipation dissimulated what seems glaring today namely that intellectuals were recognized and paid not because they were enlightened or bright but because they were an efficient tool of destruction 
the conservative right has often lacked a milieu for intellectual types the average conservative was reluctant to pay someone he saw as a parasite such a lack pushed a number of high iqs to the arms of the left who made an establishment out of them and paid them to enforce globalism antiwhiteness antimasculinity pathological altruism transgender madness politically correct repression and so on intellectuals were never paid to say the truth they were paid as tools who performed a primarily destructive social function 
if we happen to beat cultural marxism what shall we do with intellectual types if we are to dismantle globalism and build healthier societies we have to think about what we will replace the bobo leftist establishment the intellectual mediocrity and spinelessness of the average conservative is no solution a truly traditional society would likely have initiates something akin to high priests and knights in lieu of vacuous and coward talkers how exactly we go there or how exactly this could look today is another question conclusion 
the french essayist alain soral once famously said a journalist is either a whore or without a job this is even truer for most intellectuals sold as they are to a destructive left or more seldomly to the inefficient right 
culture is overrated what the mainstream refers to under that name is a giant matrix full of lies taboos and the snobbery of talking heads who end up lying to everyone or believing into their own bullshit no wonder why the shrewd robert greene advised to be an intense realist one must cultivate inner intuition and situational awareness not to fall prey to some of the claptrap that constitutes at least eighty per cent of current mainstream culture 
the previous generations could join the cultural marxist establishment and pretend their destructive egoladen works were progress to our generation this is impossible either we stand up for our very existence even if we must go against more than two centuries of manipulations and lies or we resign ourselves to an ignominious death before we take the power back a shared awareness must be stimulated and this is where we enter in direct conflict with the wellfunded antiwhite antimasculine establishment types whom we must beat on their own field once and for all bonus  quotes about the intellectuels 
some of the problems that modern philosophical thinking puts forward appear void of any importance and meaning modern philosophy features a range of issues that merely stem from an equivocal stance and the confusion of different viewpoints these issues only exist because they are poorly framed they have no fundamental reason to exist in many cases defining their statements more precisely may be enough to make them disappear plain and simple if modern philosophy did not strive to maintain them because it makes a living out of ambiguity  rené guénon introduction to the study of the hindu doctrines  chap rené guénon young 
philosophers care much more about putting forth problems no matter how artificial and illusory than about solving them they also strive to link their name to a system that is to a strictly bounded set of theories they would own and consider as their nothing more than their own work hence the desire to be original at any price even if the truth must be sacrificed on the altar of said originality a philosopher who cares about his repute does better by making up a new mistake than by repeating some truth that has already been expressed by others rené guénon the crisis of the modern world  chap rené guénon older 
the most evident feature of modern critique is the lack of principles and of authenticity its greater preoccupation consists in being brilliant in appearing original from the point of view of those who embody this intellectuality the catchy line the dialectical or polemical posturing well noticed by others have a much greater value than truth ideas when they use them are nothing but a pretext what matters is to look intelligentjust as to the mainstream politician the ideology of a party is essentially a means for career the vanity fair the most deleterious subjectivism often verging on pure and unmitigated narcissism are essential components of this phenomenon the critique is a scourge of modern culture an epidemic that was born out of bourgeois society concomitantly with the commodification of culture in normal traditional civilizations one could find creators artists and those who would judge the works without intermediaries the sovereigns the patrons and the people our times have witnessed the appearance between the public and the creators that cultural pimp that cheeky and presumptuous parasite we call a critique  julius evola the bow and the club baron giulio cesare evola

511,how influential french author alain soral become red pilled,"the celebrations have ended and weve all come to absorb the fact that donald trump is our next president an outcome that many of us have aggressively worked for in the past several months now that weve gotten what we wanted its time to describe exactly how a trump presidency will improve our standing
if the president can say it then you can say it 
the biggest effect well see is the death of political correctness we now have a shitlord for president who has insulted ugly women as fat pigs and whose private macho talk which all masculine men have done was relentlessly attacked by the press but not punished in the voter booth this means that when you talk like trump the first thought your listener will have is he sounds like the president of the united states
what excuse will they now have for limiting your speech if one man was able to gain the highest office in the land because of it either trump was elected because voters liked a person who makes those kinds of statements or they didnt care enough that he made them whichever explanation you accept means that the will of the american people has stated that you can exercise your free speech your opinions and your desire to flirt with attractive women without having to obey a speech police force that evaluates everything you do based on how offensive it is to a kaleidoscope of races and loony identities you can begin removing your politically correct filter
im in a state of exuberance that we now have a president who rates women on a  scale in the same way that we do and evaluates women by their appearance and feminine attitude we may have to institute a new feature called would trump bang to signify the importance of feminine beauty ideals that cultivate effort and class above sloth and vulgarity simply look at his wife and the beautiful women he has surrounded himself with to remind yourself of what men everywhere prefer and not the beauty at every size sewage that has been pushed down our throats by gender studies professors and corporations trying to market their product to feminist fatsoes  the president of the united states does not see the value in fat women who dont take care of themselves and neither should you
liberals will be forced to tolerate us in a way they didnt have to before 
there are so many of us that we can ease out of the closet and not be afraid of persecution like before what are they going to do fire everyone who supports trump accuse every man who voted for him of rape the way the establishment has been able to marginalize us is to corner men individually and apply intense pressure but now we have natural allies in all men who back trump even if they dont subscribe to our particular interpretation of masculinity 
liberals will not be able to point and shriek to get you to withdraw like before they will not have easy victories by using labels like racist or sexist they will have to endure us in their midst and bite their lip when we offend their degenerate ideals knowing that the price of attacking us is becoming too costly it may be as simple as whipping out your maga hat as if its a bat signal and having fellow trump supporters come to your aid i know that if i see a trump supporter in trouble i will help him regardless of his race or station liberals will be forced to share space with those whom they hate instead of trying to exile them like in the past
it will be easier to find a fellow traveler 
men who hold our beliefs have long ago learned that we cant go around sharing them in public to those who are not vetted if youre like me you first test a new man you meet with a masculine comment to see how he responds such as remarking on the attractiveness of a woman or how youve heard of a community online that trolls liberals without mercy weve even had to devise a special pet shop code to know if a man is aware of the teachings that are found on rok or the forum  we now have a easier shortcut in trump
if a man tells you that he voted for trump its safe to say that he is favorable to strong borders nationalism  masculinity and beautiful women on a basic level you will be able to get along with this man and build a bond it also works the other way around where you bring up trump to screen out those who are offended by him its fine if someone is politically indifferent but if a man opposes trump then i have to anticipate him attacking or sabotaging me in the future i will distance myself from him for my own wellbeing
the cultural decline will halt 
we now have a president who will not encourage antimale propaganda rape culture and female victimhood while i do have minor concerns on the influence of his feministminded daughter ivanka trump will not continue the attack on men that has been institutionalized since the sexual revolution and accelerated during the eight years of obama because our current cultural dystopia is the result of intense longterm manipulation it is more than enough for trump to simply not touch the gender issue to allow the culture to return to a more patriarchal order stop feeding the rot and it will die off allowing biology to naturally reassert itself
weve experienced so many changes in the past decade that we havent had a chance to understand whats going on and adapt instead weve been reacting from one blow to the next whether its the loss of our jobs through witch hunts or the rape culture horror that has turned a banal consensual hookup into possible incarceration trumps victory gives us room to begin pushing back against the fictions that have put men in harms way
conclusion paradoxically the benefits of a trump presidency will not involve specific actions from trump his presence automatically legitimizes masculine behaviors that were previously labeled sexist and misogynist while we may still get heat for them it will be less severe and well be less likely to sustain serious damage liberals will have no choice but to silently stew on our words and we can more effortlessly connect with men not only for male bonding but also to push back against a demoralized and fractured left victories will be far easier to achieve under trump than obama
this is our moment the door is opening for a renaissance of masculinity where men can take pride in being men and the best part of it is that we dont need to wait for trump to do anything his victory is more than enough for us to apply our own individual strength in seizing the bulls horns where we can come out of the politically incorrect closet and assert our beliefs and behaviors it would be icing on the cake if trump rolled back antimasculine laws and policies but its not required because the power to change ourselves and our country is within our hands return of kings opened in  and the only surprise for me is how quickly the name is being fulfilled

512,what young men need to know to avoid a statutory rape accusation,"two more hollywood films for men that leave todays sjw movies in the dust two more hollywood films for men that leave todays sjw movies in the dust bob smith 
bob smith is a man in search of the truth his favorite quotes are were all fools on this earth and i can be no different i know its true i read it at the liebrary and the truth is not misogynistic its just the truth november   culture 
today we are going to take a quick look at two epic clint eastwood films one of which is a wellknown western classic  the outlaw josey wales  the other one is a littleknown undertheradar gem which showcases the psychotic insanity of the deranged western female  play misty for me  
both of these superb rpo films will leave any redpill male feeling wholly satisfied shortly after viewing them and well thats what these movie reviews of your old uncle bobs are all about are they nothelping you find the bona fide gold nuggets amid the endlessly steaming piles of sjw hollywood crap yes indeed 
so lets get crackin  the outlaw josey wales   clint eastwood chief dan george bill mckinney john vernon 
clint eastwood directed and starred in this sweeping extremely wellcrafted postcivil war epic film and the cinematography and direction are undeniably excellent but eastwoods portrayal of the southernsympathizer josey wales who has a major score to settle after union troops burn his house down and murder his wife and children is in itself a major cinematic achievement 
out for blood and taking no prisoners eastwoods merciless josey wales thunders across the plains and prairies of the american west blowing scores of northern soldiers away in the process as he makes a desperate dash towards mexico and what he hopes will be sanctuary but wales gets sidetracked along the way collecting a stray dog and a few stray human beings as well which proves that the only thing a man can truly count on in this life is change 
theres a great scene early on in the film involving josey wales partner in crime jaimie played by sam bottoms where he starts babbling incoherently while faking a state of feverinduced delirium from underneath a blanket as the two outlaws are confronted by a pair of backwoods yahoos who are looking to collect the bounty that has recently been placed on wales head 
here we clearly see the behavior of the typical frightened woefully outmanned beta male as character actor len lesser who portrays the overmatched bounty hunter abe starts yapping and barking in a very loud voice while jerking around excitedly shortly after getting the drop on eastwoods alphamale killingmachine 
if youre an alpha male and youre in good shape youve undoubtedly seen similar betamale behavior probably at a bar when some paunchy beta asswit whos sitting with his cucked crew has had one too many beers and starts cutting you down in a passiveaggressive manner from your periphery as he barks and yaps in an excited voice about how tough he used to be or how he doesnt need to lift weights to be a man or how he doesnt think its cool to wear tight shorts a hostile barb born of envy uttered because he feels his package is inadequate yup you know the routine 
in the films wowwealmosthadagangbang scene featuring a somewhatturnedon sondra locke see above photo locke portrays kansasborn settler laura lee as shes confronted in the back of a covered wagon and dragged outside by a group of lusty comancheros which was obviously a blatant exaggeration because as we already know all rapes are committed by totally unattractive deranged horribly evil lightskinned men who smell badly and have absolutely zero neck tattoos e   etcclints character comes riding to the rescue out of the hills and guns the wouldbe rapists down which probably made sjws and feminists at the time scream with unbridled outrage at the theater screen she was giving her consent  didnt you see it  it was in her eyes  its her right to express herself sexually with however many men she might choose  murderer creeper pussyblocker  
unfortunately just like today there were feminists and sjws aplenty back in  their numbers have been growing with a vengeance since roughly the mids and after more than  years in the saddle they still keep going round and round in circles yelling preprogrammed buzzwords and catchphrases while unknowingly speeding up the destruction of freedom of speech but hey uncle bob tell us something we dont already know and yeah ill get back to the film review now 
my favorite scene in the movie occurs when josey wales who now that i think about it is a bit of a white knight hmm rescues a native american woman who is about to be doubleteamed against her will by a pair of drunken white trappers 
eastwoods maddog character ultimately gets the drop on the wouldbe bountycollectors and he blows them straight to hell in an impressive hail of gunfire which ill have to admit is pretty darned cool in itself i mean thats why we watch films like this isnt it  for the violence and the babes and the redpill messages well there are plenty of those to be had in this noholdsbarred epic western film 
maybe im going to have to rethink this movie in terms of it being perceived as a wholly redpill film clints character stepped up and stopped a potential gangbang as well as a threeway and nobody asked him to do it so this might have been a sly hollywood warmup for the series of blatant white knight films we see today but i dont really want to think that way about clint so i wont ill just gulp down a quick blue pill right nowah much better 
i mean clint played dirty harry callahan for chrissakes in a film that i will hopefully be reviewing at a later date if i dont get hit by a truck driven by an illegal alien whos sporting  arrests for murder while having no drivers license or lynched by a swarm of rabid sjws who are on the hunt for any white male who isnt a media ceo or a billionaire 
the film bogs down a bit after about the twothirds mark in my opinion but it still gets high marks across the board in every other critical category if you havent seen it rectify that soon you cant miss by watching this topdrawer rpo film for men  play misty for me   clint eastwood jessica walter donna mills 
unless they are overthetop laughingly ridiculous obviously fictional slasher films redpill movies like this one just dont get made in hollywood any longer 
when you think of clint eastwood you usually think of dirty harry  or the outlaw josey wales  or unforgiven  or gran torino but clint made a few obscure films that were both solidly red pill and truly excellent movies although theyve been swept under the rug and locked away in the film vaults by todays liberalleaning filmhiders 
in this welldirected highly suspenseful thriller carmelbythesea disk jockey dave carver clint eastwood lives a freewheeling alpha male lifestyle regularly banging out an assortment of hot women who listen to his live jazz broadcasts on a nightly basis carver is living the dream pounding most of the available hot babes and thoroughly enjoying his rightfully appointed alpha male privilege or is that white male privilegeersjw moment there sorry 
that is until jessica walters psychostalker character evelyn walks into his life 
now you may have encountered a few of these yourself or maybe its just me sometimes i think i have an invisible sign on my forehead that only the initiated can read which proclaims if youre hot and insaneim your guy but clint eastwood shows us exactly what its like to be pursed by an attractive psycho female stalker from writing creepy notes to him in lipstick on his mirror to cutting up his clothing to attacking his cleaning lady in a fit of jealous rage clints diskjockey character quickly begins to realize that he bit off a hell of a lot more than just pussy when he started banging actress jessica walters batshitcrazy evelyn 
ive always had a feeling that actresses who were really good in these psycho roles were just being themselves but i could be wrong about that i was wrong once beforeit was in the third grade and she didnt really love me be that as it may jessica walters really brings her agame in the role of the totally unhinged evelyn if youve ever had a relationship with a woman like this one watching the film will send chills down your spine and result in some serious flashback imagery 
have you ever done thiswhat clint is doing in the above photonamely hold and comfort a crazy woman who somehow managed to weasel her way into your life by skillfully turning you into both an enabler and a caretakerif so i definitely feel your pain and ill bet clint has experienced it a time or three himself or he probably wouldnt have done this film 
play misty for me is absolutely worth watching for myriad reasons but the most important reason of all i wholeheartedly believe is because it will clearly demonstrate to you in no uncertain terms the subtle and overt signs that a man absolutely has to be able to recognize in order to avoid being blindsided by a psychotic unhinged female and for that reason alone its a mustsee classic no doubt about it when clints character ultimately gets revenge on his tormentor at the very end of this excellent rpo film youll feel all warm and fuzzy inside tooand in a weird viscerally satisfying waywhich makes the whole experience just that much more gratifying 
by boycotting all modern sjw hollywood cinema you are sending a message to the power structure that is loud and clearyou are not being fooled by their deliberate attempts to poison peoples minds and socially engineer them to be pussified dumbeddown bluepillsucking robots 
always research the plot lines of any films for which you are seriously considering buying a ticket or renting on dvd and if you smell an sjw rat dont spend your money its that simple in the end its just like investigating a potential ltr candidate you have to conduct your due diligence otherwise you might just get taken for a ride",2016-10-29
513,feminism has lost the minds of young women,"home this month popular what the trump skeptics got wrong what the trump skeptics got wrong fitzroy sommerset 
fitzroy is a british and american nationalist who refuses to apologize for the british empire as a young man he took a presidents shilling and served in the us army in his free time he enjoys studying history and destroying the sjw revisionist narrative november   politics 
there have been few true upsets in our history caesar crossing the rubicon wellingtons victories at assaye and waterloo and washingtons victory at yorktown over the most professional army in the world it is often said that when general charles ohara who had the dubious distinction of surrendering to both george washington and napoleon bonaparte surrendered cornwalliss sword the band played the world turned upside down 
today the establishment and the intellectuals cannot help but share a similar sentiment as cornwallis or ohara did at yorktown and i fully admit in spite of my vote for trump i fully expected him to lose the polls his  negative approval rating and the sheer forces of the media the fbi and even some republicans were arrayed against him my skepticism of trump was not his ideas but his chances of winning the election myself and other conservative intellectual skeptics who voted for him were wrong 
i am one of the intellectuals who expected a trump defeat ive been studying politics history and economics for years reading countless books on the matter from the prince to freakonomics to the wealth of nations 
and i was wrong it was a canadian housewife and an iranian pickup artist who called it correctly for trump trump beat the odds he beat the intellectuals and made the establishment babies in the hands of a giant as was said after napoleons resounding victory at austerlitz in  
the left is currently in panicmode in an attempt to explain how they lost they are calling trump supporters racist sexists homophobic and even sex offenders but in the end it was this same blindness that made them psychologically incapable of defeating donald trump trump was immune to almost all conventional political weapons trump won because of the following 
 the left seemed far more interested in calling trump and his supporters racist than saying something of substance 
 outlets such as the new york times did blatantly stupid crap like try to blame the nra for the orlando shootings and even tried to call them terrorists in this they beat even trump in outrageousness they thought the american people were stupid so they just lied to them and said fuck it those peasants will believe anything we write 
 all trump had to do was call them on their bullshit and call them liars and he was  right the msm has lied to the american people this entire election cycle subsequent to every terrorist attack perpetrated by a muslim the msm continued to push the narrative that home grown rightwing terrorism is the real problem trump called them on their lies and the american people who are tired of being lied to by the msm cheered him on even if he had a few issues with the truth himself 
 the democrats ran the absolute worst candidate possible hillary clinton had negative approval ratings that rivaled trumps own and she was bland and she couldnt decide if she was a moderate or a firebrand progressive and she is corrupt and lied about it stupidly thinking the american people were too ignorant to understand that putting classified information on a private email server is a recklessly irresponsible thing to do 
 trump knew how to communicate with people he knew that whites without a college degree were tired of being talked down to by progressives on the left and genuine intellectuals on the right like myself i freely admit i am guilty of this when you study two thousand years of philosophy economics and rhetoric cicero was particularly effective it is sometimes frustrating when people dont approach a situation in terms of axioms and proofs the working class that built america go by what they feel in their gut and often times they are right 
all in all the left failed because they failed to understand america they bought into the idea that americans are stupidhaha americans are not stupid they may not be smart but they sure as hell know when a liberal taking head is lying to them about now the nra is basically the taliban in an obviously biased hit piece hillary took working class americans for granted and she lost this should stand as a parallel for black americans whom the democrats also take for granted 
i am pleased that donald trump is now presidentelect he wasnt just a candidate he was the anticandidate he did everything a politician should not do he used vulgar language he talked freely about his ideas he made no pretense about being polite to those who are destroying america he turned weaknesses such as his spotty track record into strengths that would have ended any other candidates campaign he was the uncandidate america needed 
i have high hopes for trumps presidency in spite of my tepid support i see trump as a president who can do a lot of good and has the potential to do more good than any president of recent memory 
first trump spat in the face of pc culture and won just as scott walker took on the unions in wisconsin and cucked them by winning the recall election by getting more votes than he did in the previous election trump defeated the sjws if trump can keep this up we can achieve a major strategic victory in the war against political correctness and get back to a concept called actually being correct 
secondly trump is an unapologetic nationalist he loves america and doesnt give a damn if you think howard zinns a peoples history of the united states is a great book the department of cultural guilt that has infected schools in america teaches children to hate their own country i look forward to seeing trump abolish the practice of teaching children that the founding fathers were evil racists the british empire did nothing good for the world and that america is the greatest evil the world has ever seen 
lastly trump is the antithesis of everything the social justice warriors stand for a successful alpha male who tells people to go fuck themselves and still gets elected i hope to see a rise in masculinity in america studies have shown that testosterone levels are down among the american male population this should rise under trump as men embrace their masculinity instead of hiding it for fear of being accused of sexual assault 
i was a trump skeptic i underestimated him i didnt disagree with him on much perhaps maybe  of his platform but i had little faith he could pull it off and i was vocal about my concerns regarding his electability but like the liberals i was wrong and a canadian housewife and a former pickupartistturnedconservativephilosopher were  right 
i recall something i told a fellow soldier while on a long boring convoy operation in iraq when a genius says something others say wow that is way above my head but when a true genius says something others say wow why didnt i think of that before trump is a true genius he stated the obvious to the american people and made them believe he wanted to make america great again and i think he genuinely does he didnt use fancy graphs or focus groups he spoke the truth without political correctness 
and now he is presidentelect",2016-10-29
514,why its necessary to relax into a stretch,"home this month popular why its absolutely worth it to learn game why its absolutely worth it to learn game 
jon enjoys helping others evolve into their best selves on his blog masculine development and recently launched his ebook on  strategies to develop your masculinity november   game 
after my previous article  which advocated that men learn game as a form of selfdevelopment i got a good amount of disagreementmost of it was not inaccurate the majority of rok readers are becoming less and less interested in learning game simply because western women are not as attractive as they once were 
this isnt to say that weve abandoned learning game as a whole certainly we still want to get laid and eventually find a girl for a relationship but nonetheless there seems to be a large portion of the manosphere which simply doesnt believe that game is worth it anymore 
in this article i would like to present a very realistic and objective perspective in regards to learning game in retrospect my last article may have been too focused on the positive aspects i do not wear the rose colored glasses in regards to the game in fact its quite the opposite 
as a veteran myself im quite aware of the troubles that men can encounter when learning game ive been slapped for making mildly offensive jokes ive had drinks thrown on me ive had guys threaten to slit my throat and more despite this however i still believe that it is  worth it to learn game beginners hell how dare you try to ask me my name you fucking rapist 
i believe that the reason why most men dont feel that game is worth it is because they experience difficulty getting over a period known as beginners hell this is when youre just starting to shrug off your feminist conditioning  and you havent developed the confidence or game that you need to succeed 
most beginners walk around not really knowing how to talk to women  how to carry themselves or how to flirt in general because of this women will typically have one of two responses they pity you and ignore you they lash out and berate you for being a creep or weird 
of course you may get the occasional girl whos drunk enough to be into you but these are few and far between for the most part the beginners hell phase of learning game is absolutely horrendous 
you will be sometimes be targeted by club douchebags who will either confront you or use their superior social intelligence to embarrass you and on the rare occasion that you do manage to get a girl talking to you hell come over and steal her you will have women smack you ignore you and tell you offagain its called beginners hell for a reason s who think theyre s 
this initial difficulty in learning game is only compounded by our cultures general lack of femininity it is extremely obvious to anyone with eyes to see that women in our culture are encouraged to be less and less feminine as time goes on the once praised virtues of nurturing empathy and kindness have now been replaced by resting bitch face sociopathy and social climbing 
this coupled with the fact that women experience an endless supply of beta orbiters means that theyve been conditioned to believe theyre highly sought after goddesses who can use men like tissues without any sort of social repercussions and in fact theyre sometimes praised for doing so 
this is perhaps one of the biggest obstacles to newbies struggling to learn game couple this with severe approach anxiety a complete lack of masculinity and a weak body that hasnt been trained and its very easy to see why most men dont see that game is worth it the turning point 
once one gets beyond this initial bump however most of game is smooth sailing once the newbie has learned how to fix his lack of masculinity how to balance assertiveness with consent  and has improved his game in general he enters what i call the turning point 
the turning point is essentially that point at which learning game is no longer a struggle but its actually enjoyable this is due to several key lifestyle and mindset shifts which take place as the newbie gets more and more success such as drawing state from within rather than from without being in a state of abundance rather than scarcity improving other areas of your life which creates an upwards spiral 
if youre a newbie struggling to learn game and you dont feel like its worth it i fully empathize with your painthe problem is that when you dont have much game of course learning game will be hard because you get stuck with the bitchy fat girls 
when you start to develop the three characteristics that i mentioned however a cascade of effects starts to take place that catapults your game to the next level this allows you to pick and choose which hot girls you want rather than being at the mercy of the ugly  who might want to come over and hang out internal vs external drawing of state by my age you realize that bitches aint shit but hoes and tricks 
the transition from drawing state from outside of you to drawing state from within you is literally the difference between a guy that doesnt pull at all and a guy that can pull victorias secret models 
let me explain women typically draw state from without this means that their emotions are governed by their environment this is why they respond so much more to social pressure than men why they just want to dance when a song they like comes on and its why theyre generally so emotionally volatile 
due to their changing environments their emotions change rapidly as well this is why they want men to draw state from within or in other words not be affected by their outside environments this is why women are repulsed by men who care too much about their opinions its indicative of a man who draws state from without 
as a man drawing state from within has numerous benefits the most obvious of which being that youre perpetually in a good mood once you learn to make this shift and learn to be happy regardless of your external circumstances women will pick up on it like a hawktheyre very attuned to this type of thing and youll definitely notice a difference in their behavior 
this will get them vying for your attention which will start to give you tremendous power this will make game fun which will lead to even more women in your life which will begin the start of your upward spiral the beginning of the upward spiral 
once you begin to make this simple mindset shift game will no longer feel like its not worth it you see game feels like its not worth it when you have to put in a huge amount of effort for a below average looking girl with a horrible personality but when you start to get to the point where you can put in a medium amount of effort for a very gorgeous woman thats when game starts to be fun 
this basic mindset shift of learning to not care what your environment is like and to simply be happy by yourself will create a chain reaction within your life first youll start to get much more women much more easily this will allow you to start a harem which will keep you in a perpetual state of abundance until you find a girl you want for a relationship 
this state of abundance will amplify your game by about five fold women will sense that youve got a ton of other women vying for your attention and they will do the sameits like a magnet that just draws them in plus if a girl does or says something that you dislike you can simply kick her out of your life since you have so many other women 
then when you start to have so many women in your life youll start to friend zone hot girls for the social benefits  because you simply cant handle sleeping with all of them theyll invite you to parties and try to hook you up with their friends and youll receive many of the social benefits that they do game is worth it it just sucks at first getting over beginners hell is a lot like this once you get to the other side its all downhill though 
as i have made clear learning game at first is a huge struggleyou will encounter massive cock blocks a lot of negativity from women and not to mention youll have to deal with all of the white knights too but if you can learn to get over this initial beginners hell as ive coined it you will see the other side of reality that most men are shielded from 
i realize that it can be very difficult to learn game at first and can feel like it isnt worth it but if you make a decision to put in the effort and learn it your world will literally be x better than before if youre struggling with learning game initially be sure to maximize your appearance 
get some height increasing soles read through some of the style articles on rok get a good designer haircut and learn to perfect your appearance at least as much as you can consider taking some martial arts classes to boost your confidence as well 
ultimately however if you want to learn game and experience what its like to have dozens of hot girls hitting you up you just have to bite the bullet and go out go clubbing go to bars go on trips to las vegas or miami approach women during the day and approach them during the nighteventually youll get over this beginners hell and will experience an abundance of women in your life",2016-10-30
515,how population growth industrial agriculture and environmental pollution may have weakened society,"buzz aldrin is a warning of how success can lead to depression buzz aldrin is a warning of how success can lead to depression aaron clarey 
captain capitalism is the resident economist of the manoandrosphere he is a misanthropic hedonist nihilistic cynical type but he keeps getting proved right every day he is the author of  enjoy the decline   worthless  and  bachelor pad economics  his newest book is  the black mans guide out of poverty  he also runs the advisory  asshole consulting  you can read his daily rantings at his blog captain capitalism  november   masculinity 
buzz aldrin and neil armstrong are household names because they were the first men to land on the moon and while neil is perhaps the moreremembered of the two because he was technically the first to land on the moon buzz is just as remembered because of his unique name while i bet most of you dont know who the third guy was but technicalities of who landed where first and who had cool names aside buzz aldrin will forever be one of the worlds greatest historical figures because of his unrivaled accomplishments and will die a better man than the vast majority of us 
but did you know buzz aldrin was an alcoholic and after retiring he fell into a severe depression and after his divorce his days consisted of drinking alone in his apartment fetching kfc and booze until he entered rehab 
its a hard fact to believe where a man who seems to have everything fame a superaccomplished career and least of all the titaniumstrong professionalism and selfdiscipline to become an astronaut yet he ends up down depressed drunk and perhaps even suicidal like any other ordinary piece of trailer trash but while it doesnt make sense at first and you cant see how this relates to you realize theres a very good and simple reason for this fall from great heights the buzz aldrin syndrome 
understand as we use the internet to accumulate the wisdom and knowledge to rocket past our contemporaries and excel in life a problem is festering that you are unaware of additionally much like alzheimers it is not prevalent today but as humans advance more and live longer it will become increasingly common therefore we have the option to identify it today prepare for it now and thus avoid the pain and insanity that comes with having a problem we cant identify 
or 
we can have it devastate our lives later 
it is the buzz aldrin syndrome 
the buzz aldrin syndrome is where a man achieves such greatness such accomplishments in life that he is truly unrivaled and peerless while exhilarating at first perhaps even earning one fame riches and fortune the success also unintentionally alienates the person from the rest of society at the time buzz aldrin only had three or four other astronauts who he could really talk to confide in and relate to the remaining  billion people on the planet at the time were just starstruck wideeyed sheep alas buzz aldrin could be surrounded by scores of fans at a party but still be completely alone mentally 
the syndrome is also exacerbated as ones pinnacle achievements in life are likely correlated with retirement you typically progress in your career right up until the day you retire however here you leave the environment and network youve come accustomed thrived in and derived your entire agency from thus in a very short period of time you go from the center of attention the life of the party the engine of the machineto a retiree in california drinking scotch and eating kfc longing for the days you could go back to the office again without the environment you derived all your worth and value from you lose purpose in life you lose mental stimulation you lose your peers and very likely sink into a crippling depression the perfect storm 
there are seven factors that when combined create the perfect storm for the buzz aldrin syndrome to form and most rok readers either have these traits are affected by them  technological advancements 
technology has always advanced but in this particular case it affects us in two specific ways making living expenses cheaper and allowing for more and easier ways to make money 
as opposed to the s most of a mans life was spent toiling in the field he didnt have time to contemplate loftier or heavier subjects much like the purpose of life what is mans reason for being etc you had to worry about the plague tetanus your wife dying in labor and whether thered be enough crops to survive the coming winter but today through economics capitalism agricultural technology etc a single man can basically eat for nearfree at walmart or the local grocery store 
technology has also freed us from work not so much from the fact we have to work but in terms of how much time we need to spend on it in order to survive no more than a decade ago a young man had to work  hours a week  for a commute and likely for an inept baby boomer boss who was never going to let you get past the cubicle plantation now with the internet not only can a man give the proverbial finger to rush hour and a commute but his boss as well making whatever minimalistic modicum of money he needs to survive through online entrepreneurship in short it has never been easier to satisfy maslows first three and vital hierarchy of needs freeing a mans mind to pursue his own excellence not to mention ponder his point and purpose in being here  minimalism 
it is no secret that red pill men practice or at least pursue minimalism we know that material things do not matter as it is the love and friendship from our fellow man friends family and loved ones that matter most you know that it would be nice to have that shelby super snake mustang but youd never trade it in for a lifetime of conversations and cigars with your best friend additionally we value our freedom above all else and refuse to subjugate ourselves to becoming debt slaves by buying things we plain dont need 
jettisoning these material desires liberates more of our finite lives from work and a commute to once again pursue our passions our fields our adventures and our lives in simply refusing to buy a mcmansion and take on a car loan we guarantee we will live more interesting and rewarding lives than  of our peers  avoiding divorce and unwanted children 
further saving us more time is the disproportionate number of us refusing to have children or marry in fear of divorce and for those of us who do marry we are fully aware of what to look for more or less immunizing us from divorce  knowledge of women 
to be blunt and honestly assess the good the manosphere and red pill community have done we have saved the lives of millions of young men and prevented older ones from wasting what remains of theirs if i were to estimate it every boy born today will save at least a decade of time that would have otherwise been wasted at nightclubs chasing tail dating the wrong girls and perhaps even marrying the wrong ones 
being a product of the s i have often talked with my gen x peers where we estimated what we could have done had we not wasted the s and s chasing women we were either never going to get or would regret catching we could have easily had doctorates houses built by our own hands much better careers not to mention better mental health as we would have avoided all the batshit insane women we sifted through young men today especially those who consume the red pill will easily have a decade of time on us by simply learning from our mistakes   selfimprovement 
unless you are in the virgintow community you know how important selfimprovement is to a mans life you have this one finite life on this planet and not only is it imperative you enjoy it but you must ensure it is a masterpiece of art in whatever endeavors you choose to excel in this may not land you on the moon but you will achieve greatness and excellence in some capacity or another music literature innovation philosophy being a good dad something you will not idly stand by sitting on your ass majoring in sociology or collecting a welfare check as you knock up baby mama after baby momma you will be notable and leave a positive legacy on this world  entrepreneurship or stem 
most of you know not to major in stupid worthless shit  you also know that for the majority of us entrepreneurship or selfemployment is the only form of employment that we can tolerate because of this two things will happen in your life one you will save an inordinate amount of time spent trying to make a go at a career that just isnt in demand in the real world you will work as an engineer a programmer a doctor or some real professiontrade which will not only pay you a handsome wage but make your life incredibly easier two at some point in time you will come up with an idea that will either cement your success in your career or outright launch a successful entrepreneurial endeavor this will free you from your dependence on traditional employers ensure your financial future is sound but it will also likely lead towards you achieving your legacy in excellence 
in the veritable sea of liberal arts majors not one of their millions will ever make anything of themselves they will simply waste away doubling down on masters degrees and doctorates in their hopelessly worthless fields worse they will be crippled until death with student loans and inadequate compensation as they beg and vote for other peoples money they will die like most unmentionable irrelevant and forgotten 
you will not  a high intelligence 
to make all of this a reality you need the raw intellectual capacity to bring this to fruition while no studies have been done if you have the independent mindedness to be reading rok id estimate the average iq of rok readers to be  however keep in mind while being highly intelligent is an asset it is also a curse  like rok you are on the fringe and because of that you are not only going to receive an inordinate amount of flak from the rest of normie society but relating to the rest of it let alone finding a healthy and rewarding social life in it is going to prove next to impossible 
when you combine these traits and conditions you have what is arguably the perfect environment for a great life to form you need very little to survive because you wont waste your resources on frivolous material things in life you also have very little liabilities or responsibilities not only because youre a minimalist but are likely not going to marry or have children the lions share of your time and energies can be dedicated towards achieving excellence and greatness in your life 
and if youve done it right youll be two decades ahead of your gen x peers since you avoided worthless degrees and leapfrogged your philosophical understanding of life you will be accomplished you will be successful you will have paid a fraction of the mental toll to get there and you will indeed be an amazing man the worlds most interesting perhaps you have reached the so called finish line much earlier and faster than buzz aldrin 
and thats when your real problems start you werent meant to be here 
understand that while the goal of man was to secure unlimited food resources and security so that he may pursue an unlimited and happy life the human mind has no experience being here the entire existence of humankind has been struggle suffering fighting and striving for such a life but also   of the time failing  and over the course of human history the human brain has had  million years experience and conditioning in failure not success 
this leads to an ironic and perhaps the most tragic instances in human experiences a man finally gets what he wants wealth health success excellence legacy everything but upon attaining it he cant enjoy it because the human mind is not programmed to he not only realizes this rare success doesnt result in happiness or a perpetual lifelong glee that will see him to his grave but theres nothing left to conquer theres nothing left to do the game of life is over and like red dead redemption it gets mighty boring just riding your horse around after you conquer the game 
worse because of the unique characteristics required to attain this excellence any man lucky enough to be this successful is in one way or another ostracized from the rest of his peers professionally romantically intellectually some way or another to be in that   you have to be a statistical freak alas you get to suffer the true symptoms of the buzz aldrin syndrome 
peerlessness  while your friends are pumping out children or your colleagues are trying to get out from underneath their mcmansion mortgage and impending divorce you may be avoiding these dreaded fates but you are also alone no longer are these the college days where your intellectual peers in equal lifecircumstances can hang out chat philosophize and in numbers that seem endless slowly but surely they will get picked off like german messerschmitts in wwii by the forces of life and you will be left alone 
understand this has nothing to do with your pursuit of greatness or achieving excellence in life but is outside of your control as these people fall within the bell distribution curve of averageness they choose these lives meaning its not the statistical freak leaving them but them leaving the statistical freak no matter how loudly they claimed in college they were going to live life differently and dont think that you can simply recoup your former social life by joining them by being average putting on a sports jersey ordering some buffalo wild wings cheering on the local sportsball team your mind wont tolerate it 
you are peerless get used to it 
boredom  without people you get bored no matter how intelligent you are you are still human and humans are indeed social creatures as they derive their entire life value from others not things but the paradox those suffering from the buzz aldrin syndrome face is that while you would like to be social with people the vast majority of people are either too common too stupid or just too boring especially when compared to being by yourself 
go to that same buffalo wild wings to hear loud drunk divorced swpl men in their s cheer on the local swingystick team 
or read marcus aurelius  
go to a movie where jason bourne discovers another mole in the ciaagainwho set up his fatheragainwhere he drives around europe shooting the place upagain 
or binge on some history podcasts  
i know how about you go to a party where youll hear the same conversations from men about the sportsball game they just saw at buffalo wild wings as they lament their inability to get out from underneath their mortgage while the wives gossip about their painfully pointless governmentmakework careers while talking about how great the cake is 
or road trip out west and do some hiking in the desert 
the larger point is not only are the vast majority of people not intellectually stimulating enough but good luck finding enough of them who have the freedom and finances to do anything besides hit up happy hour when wifey lets them out of the house 
and then theres 
frustration  being unencumbered by the daily scourge of chores children finances mortgages and commutes your mind will be unshackled to pursue whatever intellectual pursuits it wishes to pursue youll solve world problems in an afternoon that politicians are taking eons to not solve youll come up with some and many viable business ideas discarding most of them because you have not the time to put them all into execution youll see the obvious solutions to making your friends and love ones lives infinitely better but theyll have the horseblinders on so tight theyll ignore your wisdom or youll make a great scientific discovery at work while your boss dismisses it away and threatens to fire you for having an independent thought it is simply the real world telling you you dont control everything and matter of fact most of this world was not meant for you 
obviously you can see where depression alcoholism and ennui set in you can see where the pursuit and successful attainment of excellence in life can lead to unintentional alienation and ostracization from the rest of society and since society is where all humans  geniuses or not successful or not  get their value you can see the downside to zooming past the finish line of life especially at increasingly earlier ages as technology and minimalism permit it 
the solution is in part to find quality people who can be lifelong friends colleagues peers and comrades perhaps even get married if you find the right girl and no matter what keep yourself and your mind occupied hobbies interests pursuits etc inactivity is death but ultimately what is going to best prepare you for whats coming is to simply know its coming 
nirvana and heaven are not at the other side of that finish line an active and rewarding social life full of close friends and loved ones are the not the reward for success and it certainly isnt a lifelong party until you die it is a mentallybarren landscape much like the moon a place buzz has been to both literally and metaphorically",2016-10-30
516,airbnb goes full sjw and demands users host deviants of every kind in their home,"as i have repeatedly shown in my articles i am a fan of all aspects of fitnessnot just strength and developing muscular mass but also cardiovascular endurance and flexibility as well you likely knew this already
you are also likely aware that i have done several articles on stretching most recently the relax into stretch technique that i state can be used predominantly for lower body stretching such as the splits which are and will likely always be considered the benchmark of hip and leg flexibility
but what about upper body flexibility most people dont focus on that and that is just as important to train as lower body flexibility namely for purposes of increased athletic performance reduction of joint aches and pains and in some cases increased strength i have taught the readers some basic upper body stretches in the past such as the chest stretch and the door frame stretch but in my opinion if youre going to do any one stretch for upper body flexibility that would have to be the seated twist stretch
how it works this stretch involves crossing your legs in a manner that will be discussed below and twisting the torso while simultaneously locking your arm onto your bent knees this stretch will hit most of your most prominent upper body musclesthe latissimus dorsi the triceps the deltoids the obliques the neck and the pectorals
in addition to those visible muscles the twist stretch will work the deep spinal muscles  and even the muscles of the buttocks the gluteus maximus medius and minimus as well
many athletes perform the twist stretch particularly combat athletes such as wrestlers judokas and mixed martial artists that need great torso flexibility to escape from holds and pinfalls
sounds like something you ought to learn doesnt it but how

as i have happily admitted in the past and will likely do so again paul wades outstanding convict conditioning series has taught me this and many other exercises and i cannot advocate wades writing enough more specifically the twist stretch comes from convict conditioning   the first book deals with the core calisthenic seriespushups squats and the like i have already gone over these in detail in contrast the second book deals with static holds that develop strength and flexibility such as the lsit and todays topic
while the third book deals with explosive movements such as the back and front handsprings that will be a topic for another time instead lets go into the steps of the twist stretch
all of the pictures here are taken directly from the book
the exercises the first twist stretch is the easy twist stretch sit down on the floor with your feet extended take one foot and put it inside the other leg resting that foot next to the opposite knee as shown
now twist your body so the opposite shoulder turns towards the raised kneed ie if the left knee is raised turn the right shoulder and vice versa keep the foot flat on the ground and the knee stationaryjust twist the torso allow your neck to turn as it naturally wants to turn

then lock your torso by placing your elbow against the opposite side of the knee while holding your body up with the other hand
you should immediately begin to feel a stretch all around your torso
hold the stretch for  seconds for each side when this is comfortable for you move on
step  is the simple twist stretch which requires a little bit more flexibility place one foot over the other leg as shown above then take the foot that is not flat on the ground bend the leg back and touch the heel of that foot to the opposing buttock ie the right heel touches the left buttock

this foot position will be used for all twist stretches from henceforth
now as before rotate your torso towards the opposite knee right shoulder to left knee and vice versa locking yourself by placing your elbow on the opposite side of the knee and again supporting your body with the other hand hold for  seconds and move on
stretch  is where things become more difficult assume the position from stretch  but this time you will have to rotate the torso with much more force as the goal of this stretch is to extend your arm and touch the instep of the foot that is flat on the floor your arm wont be able to stretch on its own and i dont advise you try you will have to accomplish this with proper torso rotation

stretch  has the difficulty increase further get a hand towel or some other object that is about a foot long assume the stretching position and rotate the torso while holding said towel remove the supporting hand from the floor and flick the towel through the hole made by your raised leg obviously your hand is not extending down to your instep here wrapping the support hand around your back grab the other end of the towel this begins the stretch

each time you stretch you will assume this position holding the towel in two hands you will work your hands up and down the towel slowly bringing your hands together by gripping greater portions of the towel eventually you will be able to clasp fingers and that is the final level of the twist stretch

this process will be slow and arduouscoach wade himself admits that it took him the better part of a year to accomplish this by moving his fingers together inch by inch i myself am not quite at the final level yeta rough measurement shows that i have about  more inches of towel to go before my fingers touch but i have certainly noticed increased mobility and flexibility already
the towel stretch can be made easier by remembering to worm both hands up the towel not just one actively use both to secure deeper stretches and you will notice progress
doing even the easiest variations of this stretch will make you notice an immediate healing of the spine your back will deliciously crack and youll feel warm and limber afterwards and with practicing the more advanced variants you will make yourself more limber for whatever physical activity you engage in ranging from dancing to getting out of submission holds
or you could be one of millions of americans with bad backs and hips the choice is yours

517,how the elites are using divide and rule to control us,"since we were children we have been bombarded with propaganda that romantic love is the ultimate relationship ideal hollywood movies disney cartoons and literary fiction all portray romantic love as an absolute necessity in any wedding union but how much of that narrative has been a lie is it possible that our pursuit of romantic love is actually preventing us from forming a lifelong pair bond
i began to question the notion of romantic love when thinking about its emotional root love is a fleeting emotion and like all emotions it comes and goes like the clouds in the sky why have i been taught to select my life partner based on an emotion im surely not encouraged to use emotion when buying a house applying for a job or doing my personal finances but when it comes to choosing a human being that im supposed to spend the rest of my life with im advised by the establishment narrative to use emotion for the biggest decision of them all
another major clue that romantic love is a childish strategy for choosing mates is the fact that countries with arranged marriages where partners are picked based on purely practical matters have lower divorce rates that in countries where romantic love is used to select mates        while there are multiple reasons for divorce in any society it is rather coincidental that the countries most impacted by notions of romantic love happen to have the highest divorce rates 
romance was invented 
it turns out that your desire to use love as a precondition for marriage or pair bonding is an invented construct that had roots in destroying tradition and theistic authority romanticism a movement that began in the th century put romantic love at the forefront not just for individuals but nations as well all from a central thesis of individualism it wanted you to take the focus away from boring old rules and traditions to focusing on how you feel 
the movement came primarily from bourgeois youth who used family money to fiddle away on idealistic writings
the romantic movement was nothing more than a protest against bourgeois conventions bourgeois society and morality to be extreme and flamboyant and unusual and violent even at the risk of becoming grotesque was the desire of every young romantic the romantics were in fact bourgeois origins who were trying hard to escape from their own shadows  source 
 romantics believed that men and women ought to be guided by warm emotions rather than the cold abstract rules and rituals established by bourgeois society  source 
they sound a lot like modern day social justice warriors  many of whom are trust fund babies that lash out against privilege and inequality to relieve the psychological pain of being wealthy without having had to earn it combined with the fact that sjws also trump feelings over logic its clear to see how romanticists were protosjws whose individualistic ideas are just what the enlightenment needed to complete its destruction of tradition
romantics redefined what relationships should be based on 
prior to the romantic era companionate love was the relationship form often described in literature and other historical writings
passionate love is the arousaldriven emotion which often gives people extreme feelings of happiness and can also give people feelings of anguish companionate love is the form which creates a steadfast bond between two people and gives people feelings of peace scientists have described the stage of passionate love as being on cocaine since during that stage the brain releases the same neurotransmitter dopamine as when cocaine is being used  source 
besides song of songs in the old testament  writers were not encouraged to muse endlessly about passionate love and there is zero evidence it was used as the principal factor in forming new marriages but its this passionate love that were told to strive for of feeling like youve been swept up in an exciting whirlwind before publishing the gory details on buzzfeed or in a bestseller like eat pray love authored by a woman who is embarking on her second divorce 
women of the romantic era played a big part in elevating romantic love and why wouldnt they its much more fun to get swept up in the excitement created by noncommittal alpha male than it does to do arduous daily duties before you husband king and god women were given the chance to pick between excitement or responsibility and we know what they have chosen
the works of the romantic era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period the romantic period saw an increase in female authors and also female readers  source 
the modern era has doubled down on the notion of romantic love jewish psychologist robert sternberg proposed the popular triangular theory of love  which is often used today as defining the love ideal this theory has caused immense harm for stating that all three forms of love are needed in equal measure for a successful relationship

anyone who takes an introductory psychology course or who reads a pop psychology book will be exposed to this theory and walk away thinking that passion is absolutely required in a relationship if its not there the presumption is that the relationship is no longer consummate and far short of ideal
believing that romantic love and passion are necessary in a marriage makes it that much easier to exit out of it because when a woman no longer feels passion she will walk away knowing that experts like sternberg would agree that the relationship degraded and was no longer worth saving and this is exactly what modern women are doing in droves they have shown an appalling disregard for their wedding vows especially upon realizing that they initiate  of divorces 
romanticism and the rise of nationalism 
if nationalism came out of the romantic era and passionate love was a mistake does that mean nationalism is also a mistake
one of romanticisms key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism which became a central theme of romantic art and political philosophy from the earliest parts of the movement with their focus on development of national languages and folklore and the importance of local customs and traditions to the movements that would redraw the map of europe and lead to calls for selfdetermination of nationalities nationalism was one of the key vehicles of romanticism its role expression and meaning
 patriotism nationalism revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period  source 
upon closer inspection its easy to see that the ruling agenda of today globalism  is essentially world nationalism instead of loving your neighbor and only those who share your unique traditions or race youre supposed to love everyone in the world  because its evil to think that there are large differences between a german businessman in a hugo boss suit and a tutsi villager with a lip plate the size of a grapefruit
the romantic ideal of nationalism is not adolph hitler but george soros  who insists on loving everyone in the world from the depths of your heartfelt human compassion a nationalism based on genetics and local bonds will no doubt serve citizens better than a global nationalism where youre supposed to care for those who are nothing like you
how should men choose their life partners 
its clear that using romantic love and passion as your primary standard for longterm relationships will lead to failure and maybe even personal catastrophe youll easily come to this conclusion by evaluating your past relationships and the mistakes youve made on women who you had intense passion for
instead practicality must be the order of the day you must logically evaluate any woman you intend to be with for more than a casual relationship by weighing her values beliefs and sexual history this is easier said than done because weve been so brainwashed to believe passion is important but it simply makes the most amount of sense find a woman the same way you would find a new job or buy a new house and be wary of women who picked you based more on passion than practical matters
it may sound cold to search for your wife like you would a business partner but that is exactly what she is the daytoday life of a family home is far more business and economics than love and so you should come to the easy conclusion that thats what you must use to form a stable home
understand however that we do not live in a traditional and patriarchal society that aids us in our search for a virtuous woman instead society is encouraging women to corrupt themselves sexually and physically in the name of empowerment and independence making our search exceedingly difficult this is one of the costs we have to pay for living in the modern world some men will be able to overcome it but many men wont and will fail in their search for a woman they can create a family with
but at least we are now armed with the knowledge of what it takes to have a more successful longterm relationship its not romantic love or butterflies in the stomach but a matter of practicality logically evaluate her past her values and her beliefs to make sound predictions of how shell behave in the future from this evaluation will come a logical decision that is likely to endure instead of relying on emotion which changes as readily as the direction of the wind

518,how hedonistic game became the gateway to virtuous truths,"peter the great  was one of the pivotal figures of russian history his reforms were a product of his personality and his vision for what he wanted russia to become and sometimes in history personality matters more than those vague historical forces that professional historians like to imagine as controlling the destinies of men
russia in his day was still halfbarbarous to rule her he had to be an absolute monarch and never for a moment doubted his right to be so his personal habits say much about him he had little need for sleep regularly working for fourteen hours or more per day alcohol was considered then as now an acceptable escape from the drudgery of rule but he knew when to limit his intake and forbade his ministers from excessive consumption his sexual appetites were as normal as any mans but he showed little interest in the kind of conspicuous indulgence that characterized most of his contemporaries in western europe
he did make a point of choosing mistresses of lowly origin rather than from titled families he had no desire for intellectual competition in the bedroom when frederick ii of denmark teased him about the type of women he chose his response was brother my women do not cost me much but yours cost you thousands of crowns which might be better spent elsewhere

he chose to spend most of his time in the city that bore his name st petersburg he liked maritime affairs and wanted to be near the sea he disliked the atmosphere of moscow with its abundance of clergy and freezing winters it was the army that first felt the effect of his modernization programs peter introduced conscription a professional officer class and defined periods of service his naval program was less effective and most of the vessels built during his reign were not of high quality
he realized that he would never be able to make russia into a great power unless he changed the mentality and outlook of the people and like many rulers before and after him he underestimated just how difficult this task would prove to be after his death many of his reforms were permitted to wither on the vine but at least some tentative first steps had been made that future monarchs might draw inspiration from by imperial decree he banished beards in  an exception was made for the orthodox patriarch this was a shocking step in a country where whiskers had become a symbol of piety and fidelity those who insisted on keeping them could do so by paying an incomeadjusted annual tax we are told that some distraught peasants obsessively saved their shaved facial hair lest they incur some disfavor from the saints
but there was method to peters apparent madness he understood that appearance and thought are connected and that if a man wished to change one he had to change the other in  peter decreed that all royal officials had to adopt westernstyle clothing trousers and cloaks were acceptable caftans or overly oriental garb was not like kemal ataturk two centuries later he had no patience for backsliders or protesters whom he swept aside ruthlessly in social relations he ended for good the traditional practice of secluding women from public intercourse with men a habit that had probably been an inheritance from the mongols
these reforms gained peter some bitter enemies among the clergy for centuries the russian ecclesiastic establishment had held a near monopoly on education and rural social life peters reforms threatened to erode this base and they saw in him an implacable enemy of traditional belief they also suspected him of having had too much contact with western europeans a fact thatit seemed to themmade him nearly an atheist peter did not help matters by openly mocking their rituals and folkways as he saw matters it was his responsibility to bring russia up to par with the other advanced nations of the day and resistance from obscurantist clerics could not be tolerated
peter solved this problem for a time by making himself the head of the orthodox church in  when patriarch adrian died he did not appoint a successor and went one step further in  by abolishing the title of patriarch altogether in its place he formed a council of clerics that he himself would appoint with this measure the church effectively became an arm of the state ecclesiastical grumbling was audible but peter wisely refused to venture into disputes with the priests over religious doctrine he cared about power not theology
slowly he made progress in industrialization this frankly could only be done with dictatorial power and to this end he reorganized the traditional russian boyar system in place of the old aristocracy a new one arose that was based on military and civil function his rule saw some success in mining and textile work when peter died in  russia was exporting iron and statesponsored factories made modest gains in cloth manufacture protective tariffs were used to shelter the new industries from suffocating foreign competitionto pay for all this peter unashamedly taxed everyone in his realm to the limits of their tolerance state tax revenues rose from  million rubles in  to  million in  the majority of this revenue went to the military
a russian boyar
ambitious plans existed for education too peter ordered the old slavonic alphabet used by the church to be replaced by a new system based on greek letters he imported printing presses founded institutes and organized professional associations to spread the ideas that were current at the time in western europe
what was the net result of all this effort the picture was a mixed one reformers are not usually popular as by their very nature they are required to focus attentions in different directions men and horses do not appreciate new stirrups the peasantryalready used to a harsh existencefound themselves taxed to exhaustion moscow became filled with paupers who alternated between banditry and begging the nobles hated him with the same ferocity as the french nobles hated richelieu and for the very same reason because he forced them to serve the nation rather than each other
as his unpopularity grew peter resorted more and more to the whip and the dungeon to implement his designs perhaps there was no other way but at the very least his example pointed the way for future authoritarian leaders who would drag russia kicking and screaming into the modern era some of his achievements were lasting and significant and some were not in history even great men must contend with the limitations of their era and try to balance their own vision with the possibilities granted them by circumstance it is on this precarious tightrope that all great men walk

520,podcast what travel can and cant give a man,"the media doesnt even try to hide its shameless prosocialist bias these days since nobody really pays attention to them anymore you might have missed some of the more entertaining butthurt spouted by shameless propagandists posing as journalists
 election night coverage on the propaganda news channels is a lesson in hilarity when examining the reaction of lamestream media talking heads what is most entertaining about trumps ascendancy to the oval office is that it was totally unexpected catching cocksure marxists at cnn and other alphabet channels completely off guard
lets go over some of the more entertaining reactions last tuesday
 hillary shill martha raddatz breaks down in tears 
over at abc the wrinkled old hillary shill martha raddatz was at a loss for words as she attempted to perform an off the cuff hamster rationalization to fellow clinton operative george staphylococcus explaining why the bitch lost the election

raddatz looked like her mother just died as victory turned into defeat for the criminal hillary clinton shes sure to be moving from a pack of smokes a day to two packs a day as the reality of the election continues to settle into her pea brain over the next  years her tears say more than her boilerplate language ever could
 bernstein plays the race card 
to the mainstream media white people voting in accordance with their own selfinterest is racist in fact white people acting in any other manner than total subservience is racist to cnn washington post journalist carl bernstein even went so far as to say trumps election is tragic and dangerous as despondent and quite possibly drugged cnn propagandists looked on bernstein seemed most upset about trumps immigration policy proposals in which mexico will no longer be able to flagrantly let its citizens violate us immigration law
bernstein completely forgot the racism white people have endured all year long at the hands of black lives matter la raza and other black and brown supremacist groups
 chris matthews goes into hamster rationalization mode 
hamster rationalizations are usually reserved for women but effeminate lowt manlets like chris matthews also have them his first spin of the hamster wheel makes him say hillary won the debates she didnt then he says she had the best ad campaign nobody believes advertising or anything you say anymore chris then matthews says she had the best ground game she might have but she was a terrible candidate the halfman halfalligator james carville looked ready to give chris a hug as the reality of hillarys defeat began to settle in on msnbc
 the racist van jones whines about white people 
van jones looked like he needed a change of underwear as he fell back on tired old leftist talking points from the s about the evil white male especially white males that havent been turned into geldings he then goes on with an emotional overreaction to say families will be afraid to have breakfast the next day because whitey got back into office lmfao really dude
he then says immigrants are afraid now that trump is going to be president no van immigrants arent afraid illegal hordes who figuratively if not literally say fuck you to us immigration law are afraid as they should be
jones then goes on to make a supremely ironic quote as he talks about a socalled whitelash he says trumps campaign was based on throwing away some of us to appeal more deeply to others umm isnt that what the entire platform of the democratic party is van throwing away nay crucifying white men to appeal more deeply to others  your entire career is based on just that mr jones
 cbs does a mea culpa cbs published an article admitting how badly the press is biased
cbs was so stunned it did a full mea culpa on the networks shoddy coverage of the  election this stunning article entitled the unbearable smugness of the press needed to be written  years ago better late than never cbs actually echoed what we in the manosphere and altright have been saying since day one with the oped piece
this is all symptomatic of modern journalisms great moral and intellectual failing its unbearable smugness  had hillary clinton won thered be a winking we did it feeling in the press a sense that we were brave and called trump a liar and saved the republic
the eyeball network even admitted the contempt the network has for men like us
so much for that the audience for our glib analysis and contempt for much of the electorate it turned out was rather limited this was particularly true when it came to voters the ones who turned out by the millions to deliver not only a rebuke to the political system but also the people who cover it trump knew what he was doing when he invited his crowds to jeer and hiss the reporters covering him they hate us and have for some time
and can you blame them journalists love mocking trump supporters we insult their appearances we dismiss them as racists and sexists we emote on twitter about how this or that comment or policy makes us feel one way or the other and yet we reject their feelings as invalid
damn at least some people over there know why we hate them that includes this former mainstream media news anchor who defected
shameless activism got marxism its the guiding philosophy of the alphabet channels
anyone who has the capacity to perform an iota of critical thinking knows the mainstream media is not on the side of the average american it hates and seethes at traditionalists and works to tear down every institution of western civilization while attempting to impale the most hated of creatures on this planet the evil white male
the rebuke of a sorry candidate like hillary when the socialist shills thought she was a shoein caught the smug son of a bitches off guard their reactions are priceless and need to be documented and remembered these reactions are undeniable proof that blogs like return of kings and web sites like breitbart and drudge are sorely needed indispensable resources in this day and age
we have not been getting the truth from media for generations and now as alternative voices appear the rift between the two versions of reality grows wider and deeper the once mainstream media have become nothing but shameless activists for new world order socialism the election night horror show only solidifies this point
we should be proud to be activists pushing our own agenda if nothing else to balance the scales the media are not friends of the american public ultimately the tired old socialist media must be dismantled in order for freedom and traditionalism to survive

521,will draftourdaughters bring hillary down,"the sad saga of john walker lindh rebel without a clue the sad saga of john walker lindh rebel without a clue beau albrecht 
my father was a highranking student radical poobah and still thinks castro is the bees knees although this makes me technically a red diaper baby i rejected all that baloney early on these days i write stories  mostly comedy science fiction  as well as maintain a blog mainly about dating advice political commentary and my writing projects november   culture 
john walker lindh grew up in the washington dc area his family brought him to california when he was ten in another ten years he would become known as the american taliban while in afghanistan he was known as sulayman alfaris one of several arabic monikers hes used over the years johnny joins the jihad there are moments when one realizes ones vacation is really starting to suck 
when he was twelve the young lindh saw spike lees rather hagiographic film biography about malcolm x that began his fascination with islam while a teenager he used the evocative email email protected and made several postings about rap music on usenet sometimes he pretended to be black even having the nerve to dis dr dre  
hort dog does hip hop no glory wack like dr dre and his madeup gangster stories sellout house nigga living honkey dory saying hes broke in his own pool doing laps all these playground mcs fall off like scabs skills disappear like alaka abracadab 
dr dres a disgrace selling out to the talcolm hell be left dead and naked in the outcome word to brother malcolm dre shirts and hats when will we see his cereal 
so whos the poseur there anyway im not sure whether to laugh at the sheer impertinence or cry at the abuse of the english language 
when he was sixteen he formally converted beginning his fateful journey meanwhile his family situation was on shaky ground his father turned gay  living parttime with his male lover  and eventually divorced 
john began his world travels twice venturing to yemen both times for nearly a year later he stayed at a pakistani madrassa in may  he went to afghanistan to fight on behalf of the taliban unfortunately for him after september  american forces went to war with the taliban he was captured on november  after his unit surrendered in kunduz 
the cia questioned him and he claimed to be an irishman that must have been an interesting conversation perhaps ach begorrah top o the mornin to ye presumably pretending to be black again wouldnt have gotten him very far shortly after the captive jihadis staged a bloody uprising  and lindh escaped hundreds died including mike spann one of his interrogators after that he was recaptured andfollowing some rough treatment not that im shedding any tears about itquestioned again he announced defiantly that he wasnt in the taliban but rather al qaeda his actions sealed his doom 
fighting for the taliban fruitcakes was a pretty dumb move on his part his actions after being captured were even dumber what could he have done differently in the beginning he couldve said he was interested in islam and his quest for discovering his spiritual roots took him abroad then he could have lied and told them he was pressganged into the taliban and he was quite happy to be freed by his countrymen 
he could have tipped off his interrogators about the planned escape attemptpotentially sparing many lives on both sidesas well as avoiding further criminal charges for himself had he given a helpful warning about the uprising likely they wouldve concluded he was small fry and let him go after that he couldve become the star of the daytime tv talk shows then he couldve given speeches on the antiwar circuit helping his jihadi buddies by saying they really arent that bad or whatever 
instead he ended up faced with ten criminal charges which couldve meant three life sentences plus ninety years finally getting smart he copped a plea for twenty years with the possibility of three off for good behavior now hes in federal prison making the news back in  by suing for the right to be allowed group prayer  what went wrong 

as bush the elder put it lindh was some misguided marin county hottubber later he apologized profusely for the remark still i have to say that bush  was onto something with that one all the criticism he got from that was because the truth hurts  
things couldve been different lindh didnt have to become a renegade if hed made other choices he could be living a happy life as a productive member of society rather than counting the days in a prison cell still his environment bears some responsibility for what he became 
he was raised in the catholic faith but a stronger grounding in itas well as explaining some of the unpleasant realities about islam to balance out the picture might have put the kibosh on his journey to jihad a liberal environment should at least be able to explain why all thats bad or has liberalism become too wishywashy to assert its own values there wasnt much chance of parental guidance turning him from the wrong path his mother converted to buddhism and his father left for the gay community 
for that matter if he had acquired an appreciation for good musicbe it mozart or metallicaperhaps he wouldnt have been so fascinated by irritating rap music what kind of white kid is so alienated from his heritage that he pretends to be black and laughably accuses dr dre of selling out on that note as for malcolm x didnt lindh have some cultural icons of his own i have to wonder if he received much grounding in his own irishamerican heritage 
all this is an illustration of what can happen when an impressionable adolescent is cast adrift in an  anything goes  environment islam speaks in absolutes enjoining right conduct and forbidding haram conduct and they fight for what they believe in i cant fault them too much for that although i disagree with their theology and actions on many points 
going further islam offers paradise for believerspromising seventy virgins to their martyrsand eternal hellfire and brimstone for the damned theres nothing wishywashy about it indeed embracing radical islam could be interpreted as an utter rejection of the anything goes world view i certainly dont agree with lindhs choices but i can see how he found that compelling in comparison to being at sea in moral relativism  
this certainly isnt the first time that people turned their backs on their countries and went abroad to give aid and comfort to the enemy jane fondas north vietnam adventure comes to mind an action she now regrets more recently there were about five hundred misguided youths who volunteered to be human shields in iraq for their pal saddam for all their posturing none of them got themselves blown up over there leaving aside the question of whether or not the resumption of war was justified  fewer social justice warriors wouldve helped cleanse the gene pool a bit 
then theres the odd case of matthew todd miller  a californian who went to north korea tore up his visa and announced he was seeking political asylum that ones an iffy case though later he said i just wanted to speak to an ordinary north korean person about normal things kids these days in summary dont let this happen to our youth they must not grow up culturally bereft 
in times past children were taught about their countrys heritage instructed in their culture and pride in their nation was instilled in them it was a given that these were presented as good things these daysat least in much of the western worldthis isnt happening we cant count on the educational systemand certainly the mediato do that any more 
because of decades of cultural marxism  young people are indoctrinated with a negative view of their own civilization all societies beliefs and ways of life are equal except yours are terrible those who dont see through that baloney end up rootless alienated and disconnected from their own culture some even end up thinking that their homeland is the embodiment of all evil while repressive regimes abroad are wonderful this is basically what social justice weenies think something they have in common with young jihadi rebels without a clue 
this will have to change of course hopefully the day will come when the media manipulators and educational bureaucrats who pushed cultural marxism are standing in the unemployment line for now well have to pay close attention to the messages that the young people in our lives are absorbing and help them learn to be secure in their faith and cultural identity teach them about their roots and why thats important dont let the tv be your childs babysitter anything goes is not a standard by which to raise our youth",2016-11-01
522,research finds that women as a group dont pay taxes,"shopify erased our store from the internet while i was fulfilling  orders shopify erased our store from the internet while i was fulfilling  orders november   work  money 
to launch a return of kings tshirt shop i decided to go with shopify because of how much easier it is to launch than a selfhosted store i signed up with them paid for one year of service and did a prelaunch with a small group of readers which resulted in  orders as i began fulfilling them shopify pulled the plug on the entire store without warning both the public storefront and the administrative backend with all our data 
because of shopifys decision my customers couldnt access their order status i had no way of informing them of what happened and i couldnt fulfill remaining orders they put both me and  individuals in the lurch for no legitamate reason forcing me to threaten legal action in order to get enough information to complete fulfillment of all orders the backstory 
there are many open source solutions for hosting a web store the problem with them is that it takes extra time to create the store and maintain it compared to services like shopify squarespace bigcommerce magento and others to get the rok store up and running as quickly as possible i picked shopify because of their competitive prices not knowing that i was in for a far greater price down the road 
after i set up the store featuring photos of yours truly in our first tshirt i collected email addresses of those who were most interested with participating in the prelaunch i sent this group an email announcing the store and  of them took action ordering a tshirt or two the shirt in question 
during this time i received an email from a shopify risk analyst by the name of justin he asked me to send in identification which i was happy to do and then asked me for more information 
thanks for signing up with shopify payments and providing your id 
in order to complete this initial review and ensure payments continue to be sent to your account we would need a little bit more information 
if you could send me any documentation you may have to validate the business that would be great examples would be a business bank statement business license or business registration documents 
could you also confirm where youre primarily operating your business from 
i sent in my business incorporation documents my irs employer number designation a recent bank statement from my usbased bank and a note of how i often travel through eastern europe but that my business bank accounts and tax status all reside in the united states in spite of that shopify unjustly classified me as a foreign business and gave me no means to dispute it 
unfortunately shopify payments is currently only available to companies that are based in australia canada united kingdom and the united states so we are not able to help with payments for your site right now its frustrating for us to have to turn down good businesses but we need to make sure were abiding by both us and international regulations this means that any successful charges you have will be transferred to you on schedule but you wont be able to use shopify payments to accept any further payments  
despite the information provided our payment processing partner needs to ensure that the shops are based operating from and have a substantial presence in the united states 
ultimately their decision is final and we must respect it 
according to the united states federal government and the irs my company is american and liable to pay american taxes but to shopify im not an american business the repercussion from this was that i couldnt use shopifys own payment system shopify payments and had to pay a  extra commision on all orders but this wasnt a huge setback since there were many other payment options i stayed the course because i wanted to do an ontime opening for my readers i could always change stores later when it was convenient for me the disaster 
i have a worker based in the united states who maintains the shirt inventory and is charge of shipping them out he printed most of the shipping labels for the first batch of orders and got ready for shipment before he was finished i tried to log into the admin area of the store to monitor his progress and saw this 
the public storefront was also taken down there was no longer any way for me to know who my customers were and what they ordered i couldnt even send them an email i then received this from justin 
hello 
im afraid that after reviewing your information and website we believe your business presents a level of risk for customer disputes that we will be unable to support on shopify 
we will transfer your existing payments to you but will be unable to accept any additional payments on your behalf from shopify payments 
im sorry we wont be able to help with your business 
regards 
justin 
after i read this email i was absolutely livid ive been doing business on the internet for over fifteen years and have never had a situation where a company pulled the rug out from under me and my customers in a way that i would personally classify as fraud 
they allowed me to take  orders begin processing them and then removed all access so i could not complete fulfillment imagine if you bought a shirt from me and then tried to access the store to see the status of your order you would have no way to know whats going on and would probably think that i took your money and ran shopify created a situation of unneeded worry for  individuals while directly hurting my reputation as if im running some sort a scam operation the phone call to support 
i called support and got on the line with a level  support tech i told him the situation as calmly as i could his response send an email reply to justin this was unacceptable because politely complying with him through email beforehand had only resulted in the deletion of my entire store without warning i demanded to speak with someone from the risk department but the support tech told me there was no way to patch me through since he was working remotely i was not calling shopifys main office but someone sitting in the middle of nowhere in his pajamas 
i also told the support tech that there was no further information asked of me that this was a unilateral closing of my shop while i was in the middle of fulfillment if shopify is so worried about fraud why would they leave  individuals in a position where they would believe they got defrauded and start initiating chargebacks with their credit card companies i had no choice but to threaten legal action i told the support tech that if shopify doesnt give me a way to complete these  orders i would pursue all legal means as a response to what i saw as fraud 
the support tech put me on hold after a few minutes of chatting with the risk team he said that they have given him permission to send me a csv file of all my orders i decided that this was enough to satisfy the  individuals who purchased from me but it still didnt allow me an easyway to process exchanges or refunds if one of my customers was unsatisfied with the shirt 
before ending the call with the support tech i told him to relay to justin and his team that they have created so much ill will by the way they have treated me that i will ensure that everyone knows exactly what they did not just to me but also to my customers who had an unfortunate experience because of their ecommerce platform 
using the csv file i received i was able to contact my customers to let them know of the situation and complete fulfillment many of them have already received their tshirts in the mail the lesson 
shopify has every right to choose who to do business with and i would not be particularly upset if they said i have to go elsewhere after fulfilling open orders  but the way they removed all access from my store is absolutely reprehensible and the stuff of nightmares for a business owner no owner wants to wake up one day and find that everything is gone with no way to contact his customers i have never been treated so poorly by an american internet business before and im confident that any business who treats people in this way wont be in business for long 
maybe my situation was special as i am often abroad but shopify operates as if its customers are not even allowed to take a vacation out of the country if you log in from a certain ip address pool their algorithms go crazy and here comes justin to hit the delete button on your store with one click 
whatever the reason its important for existing and potential shopify customers to know that it doesnt take much for them to shut you down at any moment and for any cause they will take all your information and prevent you from contacting customers or fulfilling orders your only recourse to receive your data is to threaten legal action and that may be no guarantee of success if any of my friends ask me about which web store platform to use i will strongly warn them against shopify 
as for the rok store ive decided to try the open source method hopefully we will be ready for orders again within two months nov   roosh valizadeh",2016-11-01
523,will there be riots in america the day after donald trump wins the presidency," ways to forge strength through challenges  ways to forge strength through challenges 
corey is an aspiring iconoclast he believes that the key to life is for men to honour their primal nature 
learn more about his views at theprimalmalecom you can also follow him on twitter  november   mind 
we modern men need to constantly improve ourselves in a hostile world like ours that tries to debase us while the lesser men embrace weakness and degeneracy we must embrace strength and discipline while whiners complain about how unfair the world is and how its better to just disengage we must engage the world with greater willpower and defeat our enemies towards this end i propose that we become both resilient and antifragile in every way possible 
the following are ways you can turn a seemingly negative circumstances into strengths  stress 
although stress has been maligned as the plague of the modern world that wrecks our mental and physical health the way you perceive it makes a profound difference on how it affects you new studies have shown that those who see stress as being toxic suffered damaging health effects while who saw it as being helpful were able to turn it into a source of energy to push them through their challenges 
so next time you feel stressed from whatever trouble you may be facing remember that it is your friend you must reframe the sensation and believe that its your body trying to help you by changing how you processes stress you can use it to succeed in life  obstacles your response to obstacles reveal the kind of man you really are 
whatever obstacles you may face in your endeavors you have two choices become frustrated and discouraged by it or see it as an opportunity to grow stronger like stress its the weaker mans inclination to view an obstacle as a confirmation of his own helplessness but you must do better and face up to whatever gets in your way use every occasion to grow stronger from your obstacles and if you arent facing enough of them in your life you need to get out and start doing more things 
how you deal with obstacle will show your true nature as a man for the world to see so dont pussy out or moan about what you must overcome instead be determined to rise above it your honor is at stake  failures 
failures are inevitable in life although you should always try your best to succeed you shouldnt be afraid to fail either just as with obstacles view every instance of failure as an opportunity to learn and adapt its not failure itself that is bad but not learning from it or giving up so easily remember winners dont quit they try to do better  rejection 
rejection is a specific kind of failure that is often the most painful of them all its especially difficult because its often unclear whether it was actually your fault or not i would say that its best to assume full responsibility for all the rejections you face and see what area you can improve to better increase your chance next time as long as youre willing to learn and as long as youre willing to try again you will grow master rejections and youll be placing yourself far above other men  physical discomfort this is why russians are so tough 
its well known that the human body is designed to be antifragile your bones get thicker with every blow and your skin gets tougher with every scrap pain and discomfort of all sorts also become more bearable the more you expose yourself to them the more harshness you endure the stronger you become over time but inversely the more comfortable you are the softer you turn and the weaker you get 
one simple method you can implement to become more healthy and energized is to start taking cold showers the benefits of doing it are many including stronger immune system enhanced mood and energy better circulation boost in testosterone level and so on if you are having trouble getting started start by doing just  seconds at the end of your usual warm shower and go from there you want to train yourself until you can comfortably stand under the coldest water for at least five minutes  fear 
you cant really turn fear itself into a positive but the process of conquering your fears can have a transformative effect on your life some of the proudest most exciting and memorable moments of my life were when i defied fears by doing a presentation in front of hundreds of people i had a terrible stagefright going rock climbing i have a terrible fear of heights and traveling for the first time by myself to a foreign country 
one thing you can do to completely turn your life around is to do what this man did and make a list of all the fears that you wish to defeat write them down in an order from the least fearful to the most and start knocking them down one by one its impossible not to become a better man once you conquer them all  anger 
like fear anger is not something you can transform into a positive trait ive heard of people transmutating their anger to rechannel the energy into other activities but ive never had it work that way however it is a good focal point to master your mind to become more stoic it can also serve as your area of focus if you practice meditation 
no matter how unpleasant your anger will teach you a lot about yourself and only if you allow it it will reveal your weaknesses insecurities and any other areas of your life in need of improvement as one of the most base and primal of human emotions you shouldnt just shirk it as something that is unneeded instead make it your friend  negativity and pessimism 
for the longest time i felt guilty about being so negative because i was constantly told by everyone else that it was a bad thing smile they said think positively they said your life will improve they said i was constantly berated for not being part of the north american positivity cult its no wonder why people there tend to say that theyre doing great even when theyre feeling like shit a habit i have yet to fix 
but in contrary to the long held belief that positive thinking and attitude gives you a better life studies have shown just the opposite forced positivity can actually harm you  for some people like me positive thinking backfires and makes things worse also badtempered people who are pessimists have been shown to enjoy more successful marriages be healthier live longer be better at negotiating and more successful overall in life so if youre a natural grouch like me its time to embrace who you are and tell the fakeass positivity people to shove it conclusion 
the road to selfimprovement is an ugly and a bumpy one i honestly cant say that i enjoy it but no matter what i know that it is a necessary part of being a man i cant imagine myself not trying to be better in spite of all the difficulties i refuse to live a life of complacency some people mock and insult our efforts  but know that their opinions dont matter lesser men have no say on what it means to live so fight on and prosper for this is your one and only life",2016-11-01

today is february   and youre one month closer to death what have you done this year to improve yourself some may say new years resolutions are copouts for actually setting reasonable goals instead of starting today we say in a week ill hit the gym and finally get ripped i like the idea of coming up with goals and plans to achieve them for january st of the next year the start of each year is a mental rebirth january  is a new snow begging for you to make fresh tracks in it a blank canvas yearning to be painted on 
however many do use new years resolutions to feel better about themselves they gorge themselves on baked goods drink heartily and fail to exercise throughout the month of december telling themselves that next year will be different and just one last time before i change this is not the case for us here at return of kings we are different  writers readers and commenters all strive to build themselves into the man they want to be 
personally i had some slipups through the month of january but what sets the determined apart from the shambling masses is that we pick ourselves up and keep pushing forward one step at a time  i started the year off strong my days and nights booked full with dates time with girlfriends reconnecting with old friends i eschewed online dating and become more social during the day time i broke prs on all of my lifts dropped a few pounds and sought coaching for the olympic lifts 
most importantly i held myself accountable for all of my actions if i ate too much drank too much or didnt take opportunities i should have i picked myself up and adapted push forward and give everything you have how bad do you want it what happens when you reach your goal do you aim higher or do you stop there and remain content with being slightly above average  if you choose the latter and have finite concrete goals you are already anticipating the day you can quit building yourself youre doomed for failuredont ever miss an opportunity to get better  take risks  analyze your successesfailures and dont stop until youve surpassed your goals then strive to be better faster and stronger

525,donald trump is the candidate for americans not special interests,"gentlemen i am filled to the brim with joy we have successfully thwarted the globalists plans to ruin americaweve fought against the big banks weve fought against the satanic pedophile elites  and weve fought against the corrupt mainstream media
but the battle is not over yet we still have much to do if we wish to make america great again this will not be an easy fight for we will certainly face much resistance along the way expect the cucks and liberals to throw temper tantrums as their safe spaces come tumbling down expect the mainstream media to demonize the altright and expect the elites to do everything they can to stop us
they will not stop us thoughno we are far too powerful the wheels of truth do in fact turn slowly but alas they turn and they are growing in speed as we blaze towards victory here are four goals that we must achieve on our path to victory
 dismantle the mainstream media 
as more and more of us start to wake up the media will begin to sense thisin fact they already have have you wondered why theyve started to cover antihillary stories its because they realize that theyre losing credibility
the mainstream media is very well aware that theyre losing their chokehold on the american publics mind so in a last ditch effort theyre trying to seem unbiased do not buy into their liesits all a giant farce an attempt to regain their former credibility
over the next four years it will be extremely important to start dismantling these outlets its time to call them out for what they are start sharing altright stories on facebook and twitter get our message out there dont watch any mainstream media
dont buy mainstream magazines dont watch their news shows hell dont even pay for cable do everything you can to bleed their pockets dry
as more and more money moves away from the mainstream media it will naturally move towards alternative news sourcessites like return of kings info wars matt forney  and danger and play will become the new media
dont expect this to happen at first however in one final cry before its gory death the media will proclaim that there is a new racist xenophobic enemy that helped donald get into office the altright
expect them to demonize us expect them to lie about us to scream and shout and to protest this is fine howeverfor we are antifragile the altright is in a very unique position
any and all hatred towards the altright will be a net win for us why its simple any publicity is good publicity a single mention of an alternative news site by the msm can and often does net us tens of thousands of new viewers
in other words if they ignore us we continue to grow in power if they attack us we grow even faster they cant win
 drain the swamp 
everything that weve done up to this point to get donald in office will be completely pointless if we dont drain the swamp this is our one chancewe have four years to do this
in order for us to bring about permanent change in this country we need to hold the cucks and libtards accountable for their actions anyone who pushed the proislam agenda rape culture or feminazi philosophy must be called out for the traitors that they are
the elites the corrupt bankers and the globalists must all be brought to light in order for us to bring about true change and to prevent a globalist dictatorship from happening in the near future we must ensure that at least  of americans are aware of the elites conspiracy by the next election
this is a grass roots movement and it is growing in powerbut we must take away power from those who tried so hard to fight us now is the time to cause a ruckus and email your representatives now is the time to demand hillary be thrown in prison
every single person involved in hillary clintons private email server must be thrown in jail pedophiles and satanists such as anthony weiner and marina abramovic and traitors such as huma abedin and comey must be thrown in jail for their crimes
now is the time to clear out the murky watersto sift through the dirt and rotten garbage lurking below i believe that once all is said and done america will enter into a new age of prosperity the patriarchy will return
 normalize straight males 
for too long have men been oppressed by the very civilization which we created we have let the sjws and culture warriors back us into a corner but weve finally started to fight back
more and more men upon being exposed to the manosphere are starting to wake up and take the red pill  were starting to realize as a nation that there is no reason to be ashamed of being white or being a man
once we start to dismantle the mainstream media and drain the swamp most of this should happen naturallyit was only through the artificial social engineering that being a white male became a crime
but we cant stop hereits time to start slowly redpilling our bluepilled friends the best way to do this is simply through osmosis dont try to convince them with logic because they did not arrive at a bluepilled position through logic they did so through emotion
simply be a beacon of masculinity be confident in yourself be assertive and dont cave into ridiculous hr requests or political correctness social pressures again once the mainstream media is dismantled and the manosphere grows in popularity our movement will gain strength exponentially
the normalization of males especially white males is essential for our culture to continuethe second that we started to become ashamed of our heritage and of our nationality was the second that the cucks started closing in we cannot give them an inch or they will take a mile
this is not to say that our country shouldnt accept immigrantsif they go through the legal process how did it get so far that it became socially unacceptable to shame illegal immigrants again illegal immigrants like i said it got this way due to an overwhelming amount of white guilt do not be ashamed of your heritage men
we have made a gigantic step towards national sovereignty with donald trump being elected as president and we cannot let this victory go in vain we must push onward and continue to normalize what is normal being a straight male white or note should be the norm not being a transgender greenhaired sjw
 get the law on our side 
as our grass roots movement picks up more and more steam i believe that the pressure we create will naturally push judges and lawmakers to change our corrupt legal system
first things first we must create laws that treat men and women as they should be treated too many laws are skewed in favor of women now that women have the right to work we must remove alimonyits ridiculous that men should have to pay  a month to their exwives because she got used to a certain living situation
we must remove corrupt antimale divorce laws ridiculous hatespeech laws which infringe on our freedom of speech and ultimately sjw rape laws
i along with many other rok men have been falsely accused of rape  its time to remove all of these ridiculous laws that make it illegal for men to simply talk to women and that were built into the system by the elites in order to wage war against men
the law should encourage freedom of speech the fact that twitter has not been held accountable for banning milo yiannopoulos is absolutely absurd information and social media platforms should be held to the same standards that the american people are
google needs to stop censoring search resultsand if they dont its time for us to create laws against this type of behavior allowing google to filter search results is like a regression back to medieval times for one entity to selectively edit our version of reality is unacceptable
most importantly judges and lawmakers that have taken bribes should be thrown in jailindefinitely anyone who took a donation from george soros or any other member of the bilderberg group should be imprisoned for crimes of treason
summary 
we are on the path towards victory menbut it will not be without many hiccups the first thing that the mainstream media will do is demonize the altright but again this will only make us stronger it will expose our view points to a larger audience
expect it to get darker just before the dawn expect feminists sjws cucks and libtards to protest and scream and shoutbut it will all be in vain too many men are starting to wake up too many men are starting to see the lies that have been shoved down our throats  and there is no going back
the next four years will be more important than ever our primary objective is to dismantle the mainstream media through natural means its time for them to be exposed as the liars that they are simply eliminating the msm will be most of the battleremember this is a war of information and when the altright starts to control the news there will be sanity
we must also focus on draining the swamp we must rid our corrupt political establishment of the people whove betrayed us we must normalize the family unit and white menno longer shall we feel ashamed of our gender or sexual orientation
then from here the laws must change remember this will not be easy there will be much resistance along the way but weve come this far weve beat all odds and elected trump as the president of our nationand its time to make america great again

526,habits all successful seducers share,"one of the foundations of living a good life in todays times is having a good place to call home whether you want a solid comfortable place with which to pursue your hobbies recover from the days tribulations and just to be or whether you want a bachelor pad for your romantic pursuits or both a good home is essential to the modern man
i purchased a home and i decided to be my own general contractor for the renovations my home was an asoriginallyfurnished home of the s and i brought its multicolor painted green shag carpeted datedness up to a sharply trimmed hardwoodfloored modernity while being of a somewhat timeless style a general contractor is a person hired by the architect or engineer to run the job site source the labor follow the schedule get the materials and execute the vision of the plan here are ten things i learned as my own general contractor
 there are good contractors and there are bad contractors 
you will run into both good and bad contractors out there a good contractor does good work at good value follows the schedule and is honest and doesnt lie to you a bad contractor will do any or all of the above i fired a contractor who had good value but did poor work could not follow the schedule and lied to me i paid more for a later contractor who did excellent work hit the schedule on time and was a perfectionist give a bad contractor a second chance mainly to see how he corrects it and if he fails to shape up cut him loose
a good contractor has the correct amount of paperwork but no more some firms i turned down did things by hand and had no contractors license and that is too little whereas a firm that gives you fifteen pages of legalese allowing them to take out an uncontested mechanics lien on your home if you do not pay is too much
a lot has to do with the presentation of the representative tradesmen are naturally rough people who work with their hands but a man that does not have a good handshake good eye contact and is evasive on important details is shady
 good contractors cost more and they are busy the best indicator of a good contractor is that they have a busy schedule and i mean they are booked often a month or so in advance the guy i fired kept trying to work me in on the weekends and at night which while it seems like hes busy hes actually operating in the red and trying to use your funds to cover his other jobs
a good contractor will negotiate terms up front and not change them and he will when awarded the job put you in his schedule at an agreedupon time my best contractor was so busy that i had to do other things first before i could get his firm to bid my work and they did what good contractors do when they are too busy they turned down my work until later
 you need to establish a reputation 
general contractors in an area have a reputation amongst their customers and the contractors they subcontract to and the only difference between those that do it for a living and you is that you have no reputation
a busy contractor will work with a gc who will give them work in the future over one who will not i was an unknown so the busy guys during the busy season fall and preholidays would pass on me and work with ones they knew
however word got around to the others that i gave jobs of good scope and paid on time i hired a sub contractor for a set of jobs and once they found out who i used as my electrician it was who they subbed their own electrical jobs to they called and the electricians vouched that i was picky as all hell but paid on time and let them run their own schedule and have the run of the house at that point i was in
 good contractors know other good contractors 
reputation works the other way too a good roofer who i only turned down because he was too busy and wouldnt meet my timetable has a brother who runs the electrical shop mentioned above although you should always get multiple competing quotes bid to three two will generally respond and pick the better one the deciding factor was that his brother the roofer ran a good shop and it stood to reason he would too
my plumbers knew my ac guys and my chimney guy my flooring guys knew my kitchen cabinets guys everyone works with and around everyone else and i saved all my paperwork and contact info for all my vendors so that on any future projects i know who to call for what and even if i dont know i know who to ask for recommendations
 it will take more money than you think it will 
home renovation is expensive and its mainly for the nasty reason that once you commit to action you can get hit with extra costs you can mitigate this with good bid scopes that you give to your contractors so all parties know what is what but you will find that the home will need things you didnt think about or that the hourly rate of the laborers is higher than you budgeted or materials will simply cost more
part of the balancing act that is required is you will learn what to spend money on now and what to spend money on later right now i live in the place finally but i still have construction paper down on my floors as i have not yet bought furniture pads or rugs for the high traffic areas my bathrooms have plumbing in but no mirrors cabinets towel racks or toilet paper holders entire rooms are without furniture all of these can and should be taken care of later but things like flooring and painting needed to happen earlier
 it will take more time than you think it will you may not need something this complicated but a gantt chart shows dependency of one job on others
contractors have their own schedules and there is also the time outside the work time where they have to arrange a site visit you have to juggle quotes they have to then write you in then they do the work then theres followups and punchlists and then finally that job is done and you pay them
you cant do some other jobs before you finish the first one this is where having a master schedule and knowing who is doing what and affecting whom matters my floor guys had to have the run of the place when they were finishing the floors but they did not when they were laying subfloor and i was able to have plumbers in that day as well contrariwise i could not start the kitchen install until after the floors were done
 some of your ideas are wrong some are right i had my own thoughts about what to do with the place sometimes i was wrong it was stupid to try to reuse the baseboard that was over the carpet and put it over the hardwood even though it was the same color and i listened to my contractor and used new sometimes i was right my backsplash behind my sink was supposed to match the countertops colors and the ratio of white i wanted was correct but i was persuaded to add more by my contractor
know what is important in your vision and be able to explain your intent but the contractor might have a better way of how to do it in mind than if you had told them the how instead of the what i have a rather creative way of running the drains on my basement fixtures they did what i wanted but did it in a better way than i would have suggested and they got it almost completely right to my intent in the process
 there will be gaps in your manpower coverage 
the one thing a professional general contractor does that you as a private operator will not is do all the basic stuff themselves a gc will hire an electrician to wire fan boxes for mounting fans but he will install the boxes and hang the fans himself my electricians did install and hang them for me anyway
this was for two reasons and this is how you can mitigate having little shit jobs that no one will want to do as a single job the first is to provide all the materials yourself which also allows you to pick out what you want i had a pile of fixtures fans and bulbs laid out for them with a plan of what went where and this helped them just throw them up after the technical wiring part was done
the second reason is to provide a good scope of work will a plumber come install a single faucet maybe will he come install five and a garbage disposal certainly thats a good days work so if you have little jobs have a lot of little jobs and youll get more interest
 there are things with which you will not be satisfied good enough is good enough 
this house is old but renovated some things simply cannot be fixed without massive upheaval i cannot have perfectly flat ceilings because the drywall is  years old and it had popcorn texture on it some things i did not address i have new baseboard and new window trim but the door trim is original and has the nicks and stains of time
some things were done but were not perfect the drywall where my kitchen cabinets bulkhead used to hang from the ceiling has one spot where even after two reworks still has a hairline paint crack some of the window film has pull away lines and theres a couple things trapped under the film in places one of the toilets will top itself off for a few seconds signifying a small seal issue you cannot have perfection but you can go for reasonable excellence
 code enforcement sucks the man sucks someone called code enforcement on me and i had to go get a permit of a cost of x of the renovations cost mainly so they can jack my taxes up
i got the permit and i expect my taxes to go up the inspector was a real schmuck as most appointed officials are but the jokes on him as i only got the permit on what i had left to do and i omitted some things that would still happen but werent too noticeable
with code enforcement and county ordinances the idea is reasonable cooperation and being able to explain things away with saying you were mistaken instead of flouting the law i went and got the permit when i was busted for it but they only know a third of the story had i gotten a permit earlier perhaps whatever nosy neighbor that ratted me out might not have called at all another tactic which i will do on a future project i have planned is to get the permit months ahead of time then hit it hard over a few days and be done before anyone notices
conclusion if you have the time the patience and the skill to know exactly what you want who to get for it and how to juggle a massive schedule running your own home renovation is a lot of fun and very educational if you want it done faster and just want to deal with one person for everything then hiring a professional general contractor might be the way to go instead

527,feminists attack elderly gay man for saying older women shouldnt wear yoga pants," hollywood films for bluepill men that reinforce sjw values and concepts  hollywood films for bluepill men that reinforce sjw values and concepts bob smith 
bob smith is a man in search of the truth his favorite quotes are were all fools on this earth and i can be no different i know its true i read it at the liebrary and the truth is not misogynistic its just the truth november   culture 
your old uncle bob is mixing things up hereand i think you will see where im going with this new angle of mine pretty quickly i have selected three sjw films to review one from the s one from the s and one of much more recent vintage from  and what might all three of these insidious hollywood movies have in common why they outwardly or subliminally program viewers to blindly adopt bluepill beliefs and behaviors thats what 
i feel unsettlingly dirty just writing about these films but somebodys gotta do it so lets get busy here and expose these three flatout unintentional farces for what they really are seize the day onward and upward or is that downwardin this case in terms of these three horrendously blatant sjw films most definitely downward  to kill a mockingbird   gregory peck robert duvall brock peters mary badham 
this multipleoscarwinning film is based on the pulitzerprizewinning novel of the same name which was written by harper lee and published in and it is that pulitzer prize and those multiple oscars that should be your first major clues that the hollywood elitists were up to no good while crafting this brilliantly clever piece of sjw brainwashing 
this wickedly hypnotic movie cleverly reinforces the statistically bankrupt notion that most white males in the american deep south are vicious stupid ignorantly racist crackers who spend most of their time ruining the lives of innocent blacksthat is when they arent shooting them down like dogs or lynching them outright the plot centers around a hardworking standup straightarrow black man tom robinson brock peters who is falsely accused of rape by a conniving whitetrash slut named mayella ewell collin wilcox whose alcoholic father bob ewell james anderson is a racist pig of unfathomably low character 
the towns sjw lawyer atticus finch gregory peck plays white knight and comes rushing to tom robinsons defensemuch to the dismay of the local good ole boysbut despite his best efforts to free the poor wrongly accused black man finch cannot hold back the powerful tide of racist anger which ultimately results in the backwater towns killer cops shooting poor tom down in cold blood a familiar theme which can be abundantly found in todays world of dindunothin black folk who are perennially and viciously gunned down by racist white cops on an everincreasing and frightening basisyawn gee never heard this one before 
im not even going to get into the rest of this mindnumbing films plot and story line because its a waste of both my time and yours but i will mention a few correlative facts here which you might find just a little bit interesting the sjwcontrolled civil rights movement exploded with a vengeance not long after this film was released and heres the redpill truth of the matter according to the  annual report on murder by the federal bureau of investigation most interracial murders in the usa involved black assailants and white victims with blacks murdering whites at  times the rate that whites murder blacks 
these stunning disparities began to emerge in the mids when there was a sharp increase in black crime against white people an upsurge which not so coincidentally enough corresponds exactly with the beginning of the modern sjwcrafted civil rights movement blacks thus committed  times more violent interracial crimes than whites even though the black population was only oneseventh the size of the white population at the time this is according to the survey highlights from  years of surveying crime victims  published in  youll have to buy the book if you want to find out the real truth 
these days washingtons sjw datagatherers no longer keep track of such  bigoted  statisticsprobably because they care about our safety so very very deeply over the years the cumulative effects have been staggering justice department and fbi statistics indicate that between  and  more than  million violent interracial crimes were committed in the usa overwhelmingly involving black offenders and white victims and more than  people were killed in interracial murdersthe vast majority of them being blackonwhite killings by comparison  americans died in the vietnam war and  were killed in the korean war 
i wonder how many additional people have been killed in america during the escalation of these deliberately inflamed race wars since  unfortunately we cant get a look at those statistics as previously mentioned because the puppet masters no longer keep such records so far as i can telland if they do they definitely dont want us to see them 
be that as it may the notions set forth in to kill a mockingbird are repulsively twisted morally insidious and patently false and if that offends anybody out there who might be reading this review that makes my entire freaking day because in the end all that should matter to any critically thinking person is the truth and what hollywood dishes out on a regular basis is anything but  gandhi   sir ben kingsley martin sheen candice bergen sir john gielgud 
supposedly as the crafters of history have quite ingeniously led us to believe mohandas k gandhi played by sir ben kingsley in this multipleoscarwinning film utilized the greatest weapon of all in his epic fight against british tyranny on behalf of the indian peoplethe incredibly effective method of nonviolent resistance 
and in the movie gandhi  there is a sequence in the film featuring a large group of noncompliant protesters as it faces down a group of security forces armed with sticks outside of a salt factory the end result being that the protesters get the holy crap beaten out of them 
in reality that was basically all that happened there was a public dogandpony show shortly after this supposedly reallife event which was choreographed by the elitistowned media and indeed in this cleverly constructed movie actor martin sheen can be seen describing the bloody mayhem at the factory over the telephone to his cohorts back in the usa sheen plays american journalist vince walker in the film 
and what sheens character witnessed and put into words and then passed along to his editor over the phone was summarily put into print in vast numbers of elitistowned newspapers as well as on film in elitistowned news reels and marketed all over the worldwhich resulted in bringing worldwide focus on the terrorist acts of the security workers at the salt factory this entire episode was allegedly a key element of indias signature accomplishment of gaining her independence from the british 
despite the fact that every single major worldwide event that finds its way into the mainstream medias propaganda conduits is either a completely staged event like the indian protesters getting beaten outside the salt mine imho or something that meshes well with the elites overall master plan or they will not even put it into print or on film to begin with  of the worlds major media companies are owned by just six major players we are supposed to believe that the elitistproduced film gandhi  depicts reallife events that occurred as the direct result of one brave man in a loincloth who stood up to the ferocious might of the british empire and brought the entire house down singlehandedly 
please youd have a better chance of talking me into using tinder 
there is another infamous sequence in the film wherein a group of hindi demonstrators is peacefully assembling in protest within an enclosed parklike area of the indian city of amritsar the demonstrators are consequently assaulted by british soldiers who open fire brutally and randomly on the assembled sitting ducks and proceed to gun down hundreds of protesters this incident allegedly occurred on april   and some estimates put the actual number of demonstrators killed at well over  
and in this single crucial very revealing sequence of the film the sobering truth is once again put on display for all to seeassembling peacefully going against the grain of the established order by utilizing peaceful protest and noncompliance within a group setting is exactly what the elite want the people to do because it makes it a whole lot easier to identify them and kill them 
in the film after the mass slaughter the soldiers commander is dressed down by his higherups for taking the law into his own hands and gunning down the peaceful demonstrators but that was all done strictly for show and this is most obviously a case of cinematic cover here as anyone who can think for themselves can easily infer who do you think produced gandhi uh that would be an elitistowned film company columbia picturesdo you really think the elite are going to pass along the bona fide solution to wiping them outuh no way last time i checked rattlesnakes dont commit suicide 
the british empire has a long and bloody history of usurping lands and the notion that the stringpullers at the very top of the greasy flagpole would be aghast at the actions of the british commander who ordered the slaughter at amritsar is comical at best 
what the slaughter at amritsar actually accomplished in addition to the massmurder of a huge swath of ardent protesters was the following 
with the complicit assistance of the elitistowned press the british commanders actions that day reinforced the suicidal notion that peaceful protest and nonviolent resistance were the keys to bringing about significant social change and throughout history other choreographed events like the slaughter at amritsar and the subsequent explosion of moral outrage fueled by the reports in the eliteowned media have continued to give rise to the suicidal notion that nonviolent resistance actually works 
which of course it does but only in isolated highprofile choreographed incidents where the outcome has already been decided beforehand whenever the puppet masters want it to appear that way to the sleeping sheepthe rest of the time it only results in massincarceration physical assault political harassment or murder on a more subtle note you might have noticed that two of the leading actors in this oscarwinning film were eventually knighted by the british empirenamely sir ben kingsley knighted in  and sir john gielgud knighted in to which i can only say i rest my case your honor  the gift   jason bateman rebecca hall joel edgerton allison tolman 
i dont typically watch modern hollywood films these days mostly because i know what hollywood is up to so i normally avoid them in the exact same way that i avoid single mothers with tramp stamps or chicks with green hair but i went ahead and checked out this absolute mindfuck of a movie on showtime the other night knowing it would probably throw me a wicked sjw curveballand sure enough it didnt disappoint 
as an aside i threw this film into the mix juxtaposed with the previous two oscarwinners partly to demonstrate how far the bar has fallen in the hollywood filmmaking industry in terms of the standard of quality they dont even try to hide the sjw brainwashing madness in their films any longer at least back in the day they could mindfuck the sheep in an entertaining and captivating way while keeping their overall intentions under the radarbut today as this next film proves not so much 
simon callem jason bateman has a horrifying secret buried in his twisted past and his wife robyn rebecca hall is clueless about the whole thing innocent white female vs evil white male the usual bullshit here the couple relocates from chicago to a suburb of los angeles where they run into gordon gordo moseley joel edgerton a creepy awkward socially inept former high school classmate of simons gordo starts dropping by the couples new house uninvited and unannounced and he does so on far too many occasions simon thinks gordons behavior is weird which it is but his sjw wife thinks gordo is sweet shy and simply misunderstood 
gordos weirdness escalates in typical boremetodeath fashion hollywood is really great at this audiencewowing technique lately until robyn finally discovers her husbands longheld secret he bullied poor gordo back in high school by inventing a story about him which centered around a homosexual relationship that gordo never had the horrendously unfair story got back to gordos father and gordos father nearly killed him 
of course simons liberal sjw brainwashed wife eventually wants her bullyboy husband out of her life forever shortly after discovering this unforgivable transgression even though shes pregnant with their first child and they were very much in love up to this point yeah like that would ever happen in real life 
the sjw bullshit meter spikes so hard in this film that youll be left slackjawed stunned and eyerollingly incredulous and if you are unfortunate enough to have to sit through this absolutely putrid piece of garbage be sure to keep a barfbucket handy especially for the endingbecause you are definitely going to need it 
hopefully its getting a whole lot easier for you to spot the bullshit that is being sold not only in todays sjw hollywood films but in hollywood films of days gone by most especially oscar winners 
the elite are always using the magic of hollywood for nefarious purposesnamely to magically instill behaviors in its audience members that will get them into trouble or instill beliefs in them that are totally divorced from reality 
doing this makes it much easier to divide the moviegoing sheep and thereby conquer them typically by race or by historical beliefs or by sociopolitical beliefs 
so do yourself and the world a huge favor and avoid sjw hollywood films wherever and whenever you can the rule is simple if its being made in hollywood today its a bpo film blue pill only and unfortunately as it pertains to movies that were made all the way back in the early s if not even further well as we have just seen the same rule applies in many cases 
by boycotting hollywood films you are lessening the degree of brainwashing to which you subject yourself simply by being alive in the world at the present time and in this particular case less is most definitely more",2016-11-02
528,comment on  things indian guys have to understand when learning game by game is a modern rite of passage that helps turn boys into men,"how the camp of the saints predicted the migrant destruction of europe how the camp of the saints predicted the migrant destruction of europe 
daryush roosh valizadeh created rok in october  you can visit his blog at rooshvcom or follow him on twitter and facebook rss november   books 
written in  the camp of the saints is a novel by jean raspail that predicted the european migrant crisis forty years before it began not only the actual invasion by brown migrants but also the leftist arguments that enabled it which ushered europe to its doom 
the story follows a onemillion strong flotilla of indians who are slowly making their way to europe the leaders and people of europe have decided not to stop their arrival light on action the book focuses on the mood of the pending arrival particularly how europeans were eager to cuck themselves into oblivion 
after all your helpall the seeds and drugs and technologymigrants found it so much simpler just to say heres my son heres my daughter take them take me take us all to your country and the idea caught on you thought it was fine you encouraged it organized it but now its too big now its out of your hands its a flood a deluge and its out of control  
youve gone and worked up a race problem out of whole cloth right in the heart of the white world just to destroy it thats what youre after you want to destroy our world our whole way of life 
raspail understood how the media whips the public into feeling immense guilt as a mechanism to introduce nonwhite migrants well before the globalist view on migration and equality was elucidated raspail was steps ahead in predicting what the result of it would be as if he was reading into a crystal ball he even knew that migrants would bring diseases like tuberculosis  
and all at once whole sections of new york are deserted a score of american cities watch the flight to the suburbsand half the historic paris pavement tooamerican tots in their integrated schools fall five years behind tubercular gauls flee in droves from our openair clinics  tallyho tallyho just listen to that battering ram smash at the southern gate 
the centurieslong segregation of the first and thirdworld brought great complacency upon europe no one could really get a grasp of what was in store once the thirdworld reached critical mass and started invading the west 
i can tell vilsberg continued that you really dont believe how serious the situation is after all we lived side by side with the third world convinced that our hermetic coexistence our global segregation would last forever what a deadly illusion now we see that the third world is a great unbridled mass obeying only those impulsive urges that well up when millions of hapless wills come together in the grip of despair 
in a bittersweet scene one of the prominent media leftists goes out with his wife to celebrate the arrival of the flotilla with joyous africans towards the end of the party his wife gets brutally raped by them and he eventually dies in sorrow the hordes arrival suddenly awakened all the immigrants already in the country into asserting themselves they began stealing directly from the native citizens by attacking their white privilege 
now its a known fact that racism comes in two forms that practiced by whitesheinous and inexcusable whatever its motivesand that practiced by blacksquite justified whatever its excesses since its merely the expression of a righteous revenge and its up to the whites to be patient and understanding 
what drives the maniacal leftist raspail believes its a suicide mechanism likely activated by a human organism void of spirit and with no reason to endure a cosmopolitan existence attempting to destroy its host culture is an indirect way of killing itself 
whenever the pop tunes would lose their blaring charm there was nothing left but to let oneself drown in the stickysweet syrup of human misery and despair set to music of sorts that one refuge of yearning and unfulfilled souls that had learned nothing else it never occurred to any of them to measure that notion of misery against the past or against their own wellbeing for them it was a drug and they needed to shoot up a good strong dose to keep themselves going like addicts and their heroin the fact that it was often hard to come by close to home made very little difference nothing stops an addict when he has to have his fix and poisons like that are easy to import theres never a lack of pushers besides modern man has always had tucked away in the back of his mind that singular longing for total destruction sole cure for the boredom and anguish that consume him 
the book even predicted a cucked catholic church raspail knew that every institution had to be on board with europes destruction for the thirdworld invasion to proceed seamlessly 
i came south like a lot of other priests father to hail what i thought would be mankinds redemption to welcome the million christs on board those ships who would rise up reborn and signal the dawn of a just new day 
the european women who welcomed the refugees became whores for them if you think this is too extreme consider that european women are getting raped by migrants today but not reporting the crime  yet if a white man so much as brushes past them hes accused of assault  
she died in nice in a whorehouse for hindus disgusted with everything in general and herself in particular at the time each refugee quarter had its stock of white women all free for the taking and perfectly legal  
yes the third world had started to overflow its banks and the west was its sewer 
raspail even predicted the fact that the media would elevant the interracial couplings of white women and the invaders we saw something similar recently when the german government sponsored sex workshops for migrants on how to fornicate with german girls 
ralph ginzburg the famous american publisher had printed a series of photos in his magazine eros which had caused not a little ink to be spilled they showed an interracial couplewhite woman black manin various stages of nude embrace with a caption that read as follows tomorrow these couples will be recognized as the pioneers of an enlightened age in which prejudice will be dead and the only race will be the human race 
the fleet made landfall in france the french impotent to do the right thing to save their country tripped head first into spreading the welcome mat they actually competed with each other to see who would be the most welcoming you can imagine the result when one million wretches made landfall in a country they cared nothing about the new social justice government that rose forth catered to the invaders more than the french similar to what we already see in western european nations 
in war the real enemy is always behind the lines never in front of you never among you always at your back thats something every soldier knows in every army since the world began and plenty of times theyve been tempted to turn their backs on the enemythe socalled enemy that isand give it to the real one once and for all  
when freedom expands to mean freedom of instinct and social destruction then freedom is dead 
the book itself wasnt my style of storytelling raspail made numerous detours and longwinded soliloquies that took away from the action in favor of creating accurate character portrayals its more of a mood novel than one that moved forward at an exciting pace the only flaw is that it didnt predict the rise of an alternative media that would sound the alarm bell even though an active invasion is taking place today the antimigrant side is far stronger than whats portrayed in the book 
the camp of the saints was a prophetic story that showed how the migrants themselves werent the only cause of europes destructionleftists played the largest role in ripping apart the country before their arrival a fact that many of us already know too well nov   roosh valizadeh",2016-11-03
529,game is a modern rite of passage that helps turn boys into men,"i remember signing up for facebook ten years ago at this point in time the new social media site was geared mostly toward college students and it was uncommon for anyone over the age of  to have an account 
but over the last decade weve seen facebook morph into a  billion conglomerate and information kingpin acquiring massive power and wealth from the endless amounts of time users waste scrolling through their news feeds this beast of a social media platform has gone on to consume the lives of millions gather nefarious amounts of data foster unnecessary personal dramas and often cause more harm than good for its users 
it would be prudent to take a good hard look at your facebook experience and ask yourself if its something thats actually adding value to your life here are five reasons why you should think carefully before using the worlds largest social media site 
 your facebook feed is a black hole of completely worthless information 
i think its important to create streams of information that add real value to your life through platforms such as twitter feedly and youtube ive followed writers and content producers that have dedicated their lives to selfimprovement entrepreneurship higher meaning and the search for truth 
so you can probably imagine the stark difference between an intellectually curated twitter feed and the dumbeddown facebook community of people you went to high school with that peaked in the th grade 
log into your facebook and the most common information youll likely find is who got married who had kids and who got fat scrolling through your facebook feed is akin to flipping through a more personalized celebrity gossip magazine at the grocery store checkout line 
every time i log onto facebook im immediately reminded why i never log onto facebook 
 its no longer useful for dating 
in college i gained some value out of the site by using its chat feature to build up attraction with girls in my social circle and get their phone numbers 
but over the years most girls have attached the creepy stigma to guys who hit them up via facebook messenger 
in addition to that you dont really need a facebook profile for social proof as you once did since instagram is a better social media app for meeting girls  
 forfeiture of your privacy 
most people have realized by now that the first thing a potential employer will do after interviewing you is look you up on facebook theyre basically searching for any and every reason not to hire you lock your account down as best you can with privacy functions dont let that one drunk picture of you from  years ago ruin a potential job offer 
if that wasnt enough facebook has a long history of shady activities when it comes to privacy theyve already been caught accessing your location without permission we can only speculate what else theyve been infringing on

 censorship 
although facebook has a right to control the information broadcasted on its platform that doesnt mean they should abuse that right by censoring anything they might find disagreeable or offensive 
much like an overbearing parent facebook proactively controls the discourse of its children eagerly censoring content that might rub someone the wrong way facebook has so many overreaches that an entire website has been dedicated to documenting their affronts on freedom of opinion you can probably guess which side of the political spectrum they try to stifle

 it brings out the worst in people 
plenty of time has now passed for indepth research to come out regarding the longterm effects that too much facebook can have on a persons mental wellbeing it gives the illusion that everyone else has it better than you and that your life just isnt fair this is a slippery slope into a victim mindset and blaming others for your circumstances how oppressed these chronic facebook users are as they sip lattes from a comfy chair in starbucks and scroll through their facebook feeds on the latest macbook

i wont completely deny the merits of facebook if youre using it to build a brand or a business then it could be a good investment of your time simply because so many people actively use it ive also witnessed the joy it brings to older users for connecting with long lost friends they havent seen in decades 
but the truth is that in many cases facebook does cause more trouble than its worth its never a bad idea to cut back on your usage or even just opt out entirely you may no longer be the first to know about an upcoming dinner party or what brad and sarah from freshman year have been up to all these years but i suspect you might be better off as a person

it seems that we have to turn towards russia once more for our recommended daily dose of normal masculinity
as red pill and coldblooded as it gets 
brother brat in russian is a  movie directed by alexey balabanov it is seen by many as the one of the greatest gangster movie of all time and changed forever the image of the traditional justiceseeking hero
it has been a few years at least that i want to share my discovery of this film with our readers it had a tremendous impact on the way i see the world and the attitude i have towards life i was convinced of its quality of the impact it could have on the disciples of the red pill and that a few lines cannot do justice to this giant of russian cinema culture it entirely deserves an article of its own
my brother the criminal 
enter danila bagrov played by the stellar sergey bodrov who died at  at the peak of his meteorlike career many called him the russian james dean
after serving in the bloody war theatre of chechnya young veteran danila returns home in the sleepy provincial town of tula
needing money and without any solid prospects he joins his brother vytia who works as a hitman for the local welldressed businessman in saint petersburg being an expert in making rudimentary weapons and with his quick capacity of reaction and frugality danila adapts marvelously to his new occupation

after seeing the risk of a gifted concurrent stealing their livelihood the citys gangsters soon put a price on his head and send a few professionals to tie up this loose end but even after being betrayed by a mix of greed and cowardice young danila bagrov decides to take on the mob single handedly
an epitome of the russian alpha hard and unforgiving sober in words and in behaviour for whom nothing counts more than the bonds of blood and brotherhood
to err is human 
his one soft spot is the faith he has in human nature convinced that if he does good his fellow man will be virtuous in return he could not be more wrong especially with women he discovers very fast that beta moves like buying them gifts and helping them only brings him trouble or ungratefulness
what is rare and makes danila stand out is his loyalty a cornerstone of the definition of masculinity and a value that progressively vanishes nowadays his brother will do the unthinkable but after the storm clears and danila emerges victorious he proves once more his quality as a man by being magnanimous and giving him a second chance
no fancy green screen or politically correct themes 
brat is good because it is painfully real and does not embellish the lawless chaos that was early postsoviet russia this is how it felt when the wall came down everyone was trying to survive the best way they could
the odd lowquality orange filter used in the film reminds us of this period where everything was made from what people could find when the shelves where empty
you cannot go wrong with a good revenge movie and danila is an example of bravery alone and against all odds he takes on the mafia that wronged him and will make them pay
the man says it like it is his analysis of the city and its perverse influence on men is brutally accurate

danila you told me about the city about its strength but here everyone is weak
hoffman the city is a great and terrible force it sucks the life force out of the strong  turns them weak it takes away your power and you fell right in the middle of it
his opinion about the abuse of power and the corrupt elites that would kill mother and father for their own profit and the final victory of truth applies especially well to todays political and social context

american whats your power is it really money my brother says its money youve got lots of money  so what
truth is a real power whoever is right is strong you cheated on a man and took away his money did it make you stronger no it did not cause you are not right and the person you cheated on is that means hes stronger right
brother also drops lethal truths about women and their ways after spending all his roubles buying drinks and dope for a young interchangeable skank she tells danila

kate do you have condoms
danila why
kate why you really think i will give you back your money come here
two brothers for two majestic films 
the second volume simply titled brother  breaks the stereotype that sequels are always awful and is at least as good if not better than the original
same characters are followed but this time danilas brother in arms has been played by a crooked american businessman in touch with the muscovite mafia they attacked his brothers once more and he will have this time to cross the atlantic to reclaim what is rightfully his
again the movie is realistic gritty but has a lighter outlook on life whereas in the first volume the main character showed a sheer hatred for everything that came from america and corrupted his country the sequel that involves danilas adventures and clueless discovery of american culture often results in hilarious encounters
un film qui prend aux tripes 
if the red pill was a religion danila bagrov could be its patron saint you can watch it legally following this link which includes english subtitles the firm kinokompania stv that produced the film decided to release it online the film being such a household name in russia and worldwide
needless to say that you have watch it in the original russian the second opus can also be found online with english subtitles and russian audio

531,more emotions men should master,"before trumps glorious victory over the forces of progressive darkness i promised that i would provide a roadmap on what traditional men could do next to usher in a return of the patriarchy if hillary had prevailed the roadmap would have been a grim one as all of our work would have had to take place underground happily we will be able to work in the open here are three ways that we can leverage trumps victory to bring back the patriarchy
rule yourself bruce wayne is a good role model for traditional men urbane fit financially independentand dangerous
this may seem obvious but if we are going to bring back the patriarchy we have to be men who are worthy of it a patriarch who relies solely on the fact that he is a man will quickly be overthrown however a man who has authority because he has earned it by the way he lives will naturally retain it thus the first step in making progress under a trump administration is the same as it would have been if hillary had been electedselfimprovement
selfimprovement involves the obvious things getting in shape training martial arts getting rid of addictions and exercising selfdiscipline the process of selfimprovement needs to be undergirded with a philosophy of life for most men this will involve adopting and faithfully living one of the faithtraditions for others it may mean adopting stoic philosophy whatever it is it will have to be more substantial than the degenerate pleasure wealth and power at any cost morality of our spirit cooking eliteslack of morality got us into this problem in the first place
selfimprovement also involves moving in the direction of financial independence under a trump administration this last goal will become easier to achieve trumps tax plan cuts tax rates across the board this will especially benefit men who are in the middle class who are trying to generate more income they will be able to keep their savings so that they can move ahead rather than paying a penalty that keeps them from becoming wealthy
trumps emphasis on fair trade will also result in more american jobs and unleash unprecedented creativity the age of trump will be a great time to start a new business one word of warning is in order though under trump the us is likely to flourish in a way that hasnt happened since the the s enjoy the prosperity but dont get caught back in the materialism merrygoround our goal is a lifetime of financial independence not conspicuous consumption
financial independence is an important practical consideration because you will need a firm financial foundation for the second step which is ruling your family
rule your family be the patriarch
starting with the boomers our society rejected the traditional way of life and adopted progressivism families got smaller divorce became more common promiscuity increased feminism became the default philosophy for girls and the remaining vestiges of the patriarchy vanished progressivism promised freedom but delivered enslavement to political correctness and globalism
a trump administration will do little to reverse the deleterious effects that progressivism has had on the family at best the only thing government can do for the family is encourage it financially and provide a safe environment for it but real change has to come from the bottom upfrom men and women who return to tradition for us that means finding a traditional woman or more likely one who can be converted to tradition getting married and having lots of children a twitter shitlord  johnrandom  drove home this point in a humorous way by suggesting with a fourstep trump bump starter kit




getting married having children and raising them to hold to the patriarchy is the long game but it is the only way we will have long term victory without a next generation of traditional men any ground that we gain under trump will soon be lost
rule societybring back the patriarchy benjamin franklin is a great example of a man who was serious about his civic duty
the next thing that we must do is start reclaiming our institutions trump has captured the presidency and republicans control congress but many of those republicans are cucks who will oppose the trumpian agenda and our other institutions are still dominated by leftists hollywood the news media education and corporations all proclaim the progressive antipatriarchy message if we dont take advantage of the current moment any gains that trump makes will be quickly rolledback after he leaves office
therefore we need to start reengaging with these institutions to shift them towards patriarchal nationalism  you can share any ideas you have to do this in the comments here id like to suggest that one institution that needs our participation the republican party trump has created many allies within the gop but the majority of the party still holds to the cucked ideology of open borders and bad trade deals like nafta the gop desperately needs likeminded men within its ranks who will help trump achieve his vision
getting involved in your local gop is easy you merely have to get in touch with your local party leadership in your district you dont have to run for elected office simply volunteer your time in getting local officials elected voting for delegates or attending gop events go in with a respectful attitude a lot of the local gop leaders are good people who still dont understand that the real battle is against globalists work for incremental change and if you have the disposition required for it consider running for local office yourself
one piece of advice if you do choose to get involved in politics dont get caught up in it one way we ended up with an ossified and outoftouch gop is that people started to hold the globalist neoconservatism with an almost religious fervor the other trap is to use politics as a way of enriching oneself in the manner of hillary clinton if you do choose to enter the political realm resolve at the outset to not use it for your own financial gain dont make politics your life think of it strictly as civic duty
of course politics is not everybodys cup of tea the key is to use your gifts whether that is in moviemaking or in running a company to help create an environment where the patriarchy can flourish
conclusion the one thing we must not do in wake of the trump victory is rest on our laurels if hillary had won wed all have a great sense of urgency to protect what little remained of our way of life now that trump is coming into power the temptation is to relaxto just let trump do it all this temptation must be avoided we must capitalize on the trump victory with the same high level of urgency that we would have regarded a hillary victory if we dont we run the risk of losing all the ground we have gained

thats where you come in
the trump administration is now soliciting people to apply for jobs for when the man himself takes office in january we are officially calling on all ready and able return of kings readers to submit their applications and take up any job offers heres why you should consider a job in president trumps administration beyond obvious reasons such as money and prestige
 itll help keep president trump accountable 
while the media is lying about trump reneging on his campaign promises its still a good idea to give the man more reasons to keep his word by staffing his administration with committed nationalists well make it easier for president trump to fulfill his political program as well as make it more difficult for him to go back on his promises remember it was rankandfile fbi agents who forced james comey to reopen the investigation into hillary clinton  a leader needs loyal men in order to carry out his agenda
 youll be able to make history 
given the momentous task of rebuilding america after eight years of obamas perfidy and failure you almost have a civic duty to help president trump in his mission expecting america to become great again all on its own is delusional we need to do our part to restore this nations glory by working with the trump administration youll have a direct role in reshaping america for yearspossibly decadesto come
 youll help trigger the left 
despite their massive losses in the electionbeyond hillary clintons defeat the democrats now control only a handful of state governments and failed to dent the gops congressional majoritythe leftist mainstream media is trying to order trump around and persuade him to staff his administration with the same flacks who filled bushs and obamas right now theyre freaking out over breitbart executive chairman stephen bannon being appointed as trumps chief strategist 
by joining the trump administration youll have a hand in helping trigger the left into conniption fits and spasms of impotence nothing horrifies them more than losing access to the levers of power which theyve controlled for decades watching leftists squirm and cry is one of the biggest fringe benefits of trumps victory and we need to keep the triggering up for years to come
if you think you have the job skills return of kings highly recommends you apply for a job in trumps administration  president trump may have started the fire but its our job to help the fire rise

533,comment on  tips for having sex with croatian girls by watch my summer vacation in croatia,"over the last decades south korea has emerged as one of the wealthiest countries in all of asia currently the oecd country is roughly on the same material and economic level as other affluent east asian nations such as japan hong kong and taiwan however it appears now as perhaps the most potentially strong among them south korea seems more dynamic and willful than its larger neighbor and economic main rival japan which perhaps has entered the path of a more longterm decline
in this article i do briefly describe the main characteristics of contemporary south korea and also reflect upon various cultural subtopics which are of importance for any male who is interested in to obtain more sophisticated knowledge about nonwestern cultures and what they might and might not offer
the emergence of modern south korea culturally politically technologically and economically south korean development during the th century onward cannot be understood without to mention the strong ties to japan and the united states as much as japan suppressed korea between  the material progression is nevertheless a direct and indirect consequence of the traumatic colonial period korean leaders were also inspired by the japanese military dictatorship which in turn was influenced by european militarism after south koreawhich was formed in  after the divide of the countrystopped relying on american aid and focused on its own potential the economy grew rapidly due to an effective exportoriented industrialization
democracy was gradually introduced in  but some of these authoritarian residues are still visible in todays society the military in particular but also with regard to how many companies are run
presently the economicpolitical relationships between south korea and japan remain flexible and pragmatic for the sake of both countries the ties to the us seems less problematic although koreans negotiate between on one hand a more distinguished korean culture and on the other further western influences
additional ambivalence might also be a result of that some koreans regard american relations as a hinder in the process of a future reunification between the two korean nations generally though the political military and economic cooperation between south korea and the us appears fruitful and to the benefit of both sides
the korean wave and the rising appeal of south korea 
for quite a long time modern south korea may be regarded as not much more than a smaller version of japan although with a unique language and some other differentiating characteristics in postmillennial times however this picture has gradually shiftedboth among other asians westerners and people in other continents tootowards a more appealing national image
the reason for this is mainly material related to a refined development of technology samsung pop music kpop tv dramas kdrama cosmetic products kbeauty and perhaps also a more exciting metropolitan nightlife and a better ranked top university seoul national university the korean wave hallyu covers a whole plethora of different expressions of the rising popularity of south korean products and celebrities and it has had spillover effects for other sectors such as academia and tourism for instance more people are interested in learning korean than  or  years ago
the nightlife in the capital seoul is unhesitatingly of very high standard for instance this year dj mag ranks club octagon in gangnam as the fifth best night club in the entire world  in the city regions gangnam hongdae and itaewon in particular both foreigners and locals can easily find bars and clubs of various sizes that offer highquality entertainment and which conform to a relatively broad spectrum of tastes in music and dress style
cultural characteristics contempory south korean culture can be described as a hybrid of korean east asian and western culture as i have stated above south korea has been influenced by japan and the us in particular to a significant extent this means that the similar real or quasihierarchical structures as in for instance china and japan are visible in south korea too one is expected to speak and behave in different ways depending on a persons age or social rank which are more or less explicitly stated
this does largely overlap a meritocratic social structure rather than status being a primarily inherited factor a doctor is looked upon as socially more valuable than a regular office worker regardless of family background it is thus not much left of the old confucian system
the korean languageeven though about  of the words are based on chinese words and its grammar being partly similar to japaneseis unique with all its different suffixes that in turn conform to different speech and writing levels these can be more or less formal plain and polite but are always related to the social relations and contexts of either speaking or writing people who know each other well tend to use an intimate speech style haeche but in some contexts such as the workplace they might change to a more formal and polite level haeyoche when they walk to other people many who learn korean at a beginners level start with haeyoche and then gradually broaden the scope to include other levels of speaking and writing
apart from the korean language a foreigner may find many things in south korea that are either similar to places such as japan and hong kong or to the western world south korea especially seoul is largely the product of globalization and as a wealthy country this goes along with high standards of infrastructure and general quality of life as a hightech nation it appears as being in the forefront of material development often outshining its western counterparts at least in some ways
the present culture especially the more youthoriented culture is safe and relaxed only slight modifications in dress and behavior towards more politeness and moderation makes any westerner fit in well at least short termwise and to only speak english is seldom a real obstacle
if a person digs deeper into korean history and cultureand geographically move outside the seoul metropolitan areaone may find many differentiating and even somewhat unique characteristics although these do often have china as its root or point of departure but apart from buddhismwhich is separated rather than integrated into the larger societythese elements are seldom manifested in present time there are obviously many real buddhists and christians in present south korea but the traditional layers of culture tend to be mere relics of the past with that said the country as a whole is overall more socially conservative than many western counterparts

whether or not the trend towards increased westernization will continue remains an open question but in terms of technology and popular culture it is unlikely that south korea will look in other directions in the near future after all much of its present infrastructure and popular culture makes it into pretty much a local version of the westernglobal society
lastly two other things that have direct implications for any foreign person who reflects upon the option to stay longer in south korea than as a tourist temporary employee or exchange student is that  the population is very homogeneous and  it has no explicit will to change this fact
this means that it is difficult although not totally impossible to obtain a citizenship if you are not of korean descent south korea uses a type of partial jas sanguinis  citizenship by the blood it is not very uncommon these days that korean men get married to and have children with for instance southeast asian women such as filipinas and south korea is gradually shifting towards a more multiethnic society however compared to many western countries the levels of ethnic and genetic heterogeneity are much much smaller
due to the legal difficulties and cultural differences especially languagewise it is definitely not a smooth process to become naturalized as a korean citizen or resident permanent and temporary living are generally two very different things and south korea is yet another palpable manifestation of that
women in south korea phenotypically south korean women are similar to those of other east asian populations as a result of drastically improved nutrition younger south koreans are relatively tall seemingly not much shorter on average than their western counterparts the levels of obesity are slightly rising but still very low compared to the us canada and even thinner european countries such as italy and sweden overall korean femalesespecially girlscan be characterized as moderately tall and slim
additionally a significant share cares a lot about their appearances fashion diet hair style and makeup are all very important in everyday life and although these things change rapidly due to new trends and seasonal shifts many will ride along the same wave wherever it goes collectivism is quite striking in that respect and subcultures are not as widespread and visible as in japan many look about the same
as with many phenomena in life the extent to which a person likes or dislikes how a population generally appears is related to individual taste with that said i think that more objectively speaking the two main strengths of korean girls and younger women are that they are relatively thin and wellgroomed they do everything they can to optimize their beauty potentials sometimes even with the help of plastic surgery which will make them look somewhat more european which partly is an ideal among east asian populations

additionallyeven if this stems more from observations and anecdotes than general factsthey tend to be more polite and welleducated in a positive sense than western females this is something they also have in common with other well off asians such as japanese taiwanese and singaporeans in the more exciting locations of seoul one will find quite many pretty and decent korean girls and even though hookup culture has for good and for bad penetrated the south of the korean peninsula a significant share of these females may be looked upon as serious girlfriend material
western guys do have a comparative advantage in terms of looks and even sometimes behavior korean guys tend to lack the cockiness of westerners but these automatic benefits should not be overemphasized many of the things that girls are attracted to such as confidence extroversion and good looks are general close to universal traits if one is a loser in the west then one will probably be that in the east as well conversely the more alpha males will magnify their results if they have the proper time and opportunity to do so
conclusion overall south korea is a rather impressive modern society that shares many of the good features with its equally rich neighbors however recently it has seemingly surpassed places like japan and hong kong in terms of material development nightlife and popular culture for some western males between the ages of  south korea might offer a valuable opportunity for temporaryranging from weeks to even years and circular migration because eventually it is most likely time to go home regardless if one wishes it or not

andré is a young european who left his decaying country in  for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november   politics 
the  th of november  was a great day we will remember it as well as our parents remember the first moon landing in july  or the fall of the berlin wall liberal mainstream mediaalmost a pleonasmare either stunned or agitating some of these crybullies clamour to themselves how fearful they are lament on the destruction of the westa curious expression as it seldom appears under leftist pensor have difficulties to acknowledge that the man they have despised and defamed every day for months will be the  th president of the united states 
outside the us the donalds victory is creating waves too so many liberals allegedly connected to the canadian immigration website to crash it in france the bourgeois bohemians who work in the media academia and everything that constitutes the big left establishment do the same posturing than their american counterparts whereas the petits blancs impoverished disenfranchised whites and local righters rejoice 
in brazil where your humble servant lives the official media is making some tedious comments that deliver a flabby criticism local leftist talking heads condemn the  white protestants  and reality shows in a very cliché posturing that mixes antiwhite prejudice with a critique of capitalism whereas some new traditionalists among whom some have been avid readers and makers of altright content are grateful  
this is our victory feels good man 
a propepe facebook group has had a substantive discussion about where a redpilled foreigner considering moving to the us after the donald won should go to make a long story short some have advised potential newcomers to go live in the midwest in texas as long as one stays away from houston or dallas in wyoming for the gun rights in pennsylvania excluding philadelphia and the urban areas close to the appalachian mountains if one enjoys outdoors while staying away from illinois most of those who participated were whites but i have spotted some latino and arab names some made jokes on these names but no fuss 
and here the following question arises what defines us liberals have been shrieking about xenophobia or racism all the time yet strictly national boundaries are much less relevant than before even for us  even when we all rejoiced about trumps promise to make a wall all over the world we are rejoicing around the gop candidates victory 
american trumpists undoubtedly feel closer to nonamericans who have been dissenting from the nwo on the internet and wanted the donald to pass than to american libtards a lot of us are ok with having nonwhites around we dont pander to arrogant aggressive antiwhites but that does not mean we would have to be racists as the liberal caricature wants us to be to cut in more personally i know of no genuine redpilled or altrighter who would have rejected me as a frog although i remember some stars and stripes cucks blaming me for daring to speak about american politics without owning a us passport the frog is green after all 
so once again what defines us why are we a we race plays a role for sure we struggle to keep the white people from getting dissolved into the acid bath of widescale miscegenation and dispossession we want a right to solidarity based at least partly on race ie on lineage and identity just like all the pseudominority groups out there we fight the double standard that allows them to be communitarian tribalistic nepotistic without being ever responsible of what they do whereas we are supposed to keep our heads down and be taught everything by liberal social engineers in a world where we would have no freedom no future no dignity 
but even then there have been blacks latinos  and many women who participated into bringing the donald to the white house i have a racemixed friend who supported trump all along this is not to say im not a racist afraid cuckservativestyle but to show there are some and we know it firsthand 
it is no mystery why most of us are white we are united around a civilization that was primarily built by people of european descent but there is more too 
and this more that i think defines and binds us this more is shared awareness  on the periphery of the system centers we managed to grow and gather 
we are all aware broadly speaking of the same phenomena and trends we have witnessed the breakup of families and harmonious relationships between men and women we have been faced with the untold prohibition to make the least critic of feminism minority groups aggressive identitarianism and with the pervasive omnipresence of these leftist norms commonly referred to as political correctness we have seen neoliberalism allowing a handful of careless irresponsible assholes sending the jobs overseas importing thirdworld immigration then force us into a life of chronic unemployment or endless struggles against other lowwage individuals for a small place under the sun 
we saw how conservatism was a sham that never faced the genuine problems we witnessed societies crumble conflictual minoritarian group identities being crafted by the likes of soros and the meritorious worker or professionalwhatever his racegetting exploited to the benefit of the lower and upper parasites we saw the liberal establishment using various social categories like pawns to create horizontal struggles and depopulation  
of course some disagreements can be found on this or that particular issue but we all see the same devastated landscape in lieu of the brilliant civilization the west once was 
and here is the major fault line the leftists deny or value they often go from the former to the latterthe replacement of native european population the aggressive and tribalistic stance of minority groups towards the silent majority the forced inclusion of individuals into sick identity politics games the perpetual hostility and institutionalized prejudice against whites and males either the leftists utterly deny what we are aware of for example when they say that whites are not under replacement or they demonize it as a remnant of some privilege or prejudice 
all their talk about oppressed minorities dissimulates the very real disenfranchisement of the white majority of nonwhite meritorious and integrated westerners and serves to deny us from our rights to public empathy to dignity or to even basically survive in a world of our own they work on language and representations because their job consists in manipulating these thus brainwashing us into seeing the world through their lenses and denying the legitimacy of any other vision 
the importance of shared awareness explains why we united on the internet a lot of us were closet nationalists years ago and still are we could not and often still cannot be nationalists in public or we would have been excluded from normal social life by the local leftists and cowards leftist hegemony was and is still real in the mainstream you know hegemony when you see it and spend countless hours thinking about how you can thrive even when living under it 
in the mid i found out about the information website fdesouche native french quote by the standards of today this news aggregator seems hardly interesting it mostly collates pieces written by others but then it was fantastic here i could recognize what i already felt about the worldthat something was wrong with all these nonwhites thugs holding the streets and getting lavish promotion when they bragged about it it was all concentrated before my eyes and others were talking about what they went through daily as well at least others felt and saw the same as i did i was not crazy not bound to a life of unauthenticity or forlorn solitude among the almighty left we were assembling and we were on the internet fdesouchecomthe website they want to keep you from visiting 
as most of us found ourselves under attack from nonnative frenchmen and knowing intuitively that identity goes deeper than the fleeting winds today called culture we often despised immigration in general but eventually things changed thanks to alain soral  mostly who emphasized how racial struggle was leading to sterile battles among disenfranchised people while letting the truly powerful off the hook mathias cardet a black journalist who worked with soral showed how gangstarap culture was injected and nurtured among nonwhites by powerful interests 
after all one can be black or arab and wanting to live in peace as a free individual not as an identity politics pawn who spends his life attacking another social category 
being prowhite promasculinity and protradition does not require being white i often felt closer from muslims with good intentions ie muslims who were genuine believers and not rancorous people using islam as a mask for antiwhite tribalism than from white liberals the muslims would not share my blood but they would share some of my awareness and yearning for tradition two things that white liberals eagerly reject faith front warriors alliance against common foes 
the internet is immaterial it is basically a network where information flows awareness and the will to spread it are immaterial as well this is why we could meet and act on the internet after all the alt right and manosphere have been sharing ideas media contents memes advisesand only later proceeded to meetups panicking the totalitarian liberals in the process 
trumps victory is a major one regardless of what the donald will actually do it is an event of considerable historical magnitude but it is only the beginningmake no mistake about that the libtards establishment still holds loads of money of institutions of cultural territory it has started to crumble and leak  yet it is still there 
major battles are waiting ahead we have to further our awareness make thorough research on every aspect of leftism and develop more proper cultural references 
always remember the libtards never cared one second about us they would have let us die off alone poor childless traumatized and demonized had we not chosen to follow the path of the red pill 
america is a firsttier power but it is still a battlefield among others wherever we are it is time to thicken our mutual relationships and cooperate more closely it is a battle not between nationals and foreigners but between workers and parasites between those who feel the void and wrongness in the rotten core of postmodernity and those who dwell in the last liberal trend between the realists who want freedom and responsibility in a healthy world of values and cultures against those who ravel in blue pill media bullshit complacency parasitism and cucking for the empire of nothing 
we are the future it doesnt matter where we are we are those with true awareness those with genuine and healthy values those who struggled to hone their abilities and most importantly those who actually deserve to inherit the western world so save it and conquer it country after country institution after institution outlet after outletor there will be nothing left",2016-11-04
535,the importance of patriarchal religion to marriage and childrearing,"suppose you are one of those adventurous americans who meets and marries a beautiful foreign woman you are the envy of all your friends what next
you can bring her back home to the united states or europe the guys will be jealous the women will feel threatened and your bride will be a fish out of waterfor a while but it doesnt take them long to get established she will find a group of her countrywomen other thais vietnamese or ukrainians they will teach her the ropes where to go shopping for the kind of groceries she needs the most efficient way to send money to her relatives back home where her fellow countrymen hang out and oh yes they will also learn american culture their friends will explain about american men and american divorce law and that is where the trouble starts
my vietnamese war bride an upscale frenchified thing informed me after just over a year of marriage after i had helped her family escape saigon that a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle when the inevitable the divorce came she refused a reasonable settlement offer and hired a junkyard dog lawyer to fight it in court losing she was shocked to discover that that offer was off the table
keep your woman in her own country where she is comfortable and where the culture is more likely to appreciate men you make the adjustment to her culture instead of vice versa why american culture is about the most poisonous in the world almost anything is better countries that havent been indoctrinated in feminism and cultural marxism still value children and respect a womans role in bearing them and raising them they also respect a mans role as the breadwinner and head of the family
i committed myself to ukraine nine years ago met my wife seven years ago and our son appeared five years ago it is worth enumerating the many ways in which it is a pleasure to be living with her and raising him in kyiv instead of the usa
 kyiv is a beautiful and lively city beautiful architecture  andreevska church
kyiv is a worthy capital city it has millenniumlong history studded with cathedrals and other exquisitely crafted monuments there are many many targets for a tourist camera the walled city was built to be defensible situated atop a steep bluff on the right bank of the dnieper river close to where the desno river joins from the east  miles south of where another major tributary the pripyat flows in from the west from their capital in kyiv the viking princes could easily sally out in their long boats to the black sea or anywhere in western russia
the sandy river beaches are good for swimming from june to september and for fishing any time it isnt frozen one can rent kayaks and rowboats or take a river cruise in the warmer months when it does freeze it is dotted with ice fishermen all it takes is a saw some bait a line and the antifreeze of ones choice there are bicycle paths along the river and on the islands in the middle of the river the city is experiencing a surge in the number of bicycle commuters
the soviet system had its good points they housed everybody in highrise apartments it may not be as attractive as detached houses but it makes for a very compact city those people needed places to breathe and exercise so the city is full of parks as compact as kyiv is it is with most people living in apartment blocks it easy to get around every place in the city is within walking distance of a convenience store of some sort and restaurants and shopping centers are usually within a walk or a short bus ride
young people the world over want to live in the city and kyiv is no exception it has lots of bars cafés and nightclubs the trends are toward sushi and italian food ukraine is traditional enough that young people even go to church there are orthodox churches in every neighborhood and a handful of englishspeaking congregations scattered throughout the city
kyiv is home to ukraines most famous universities shevchenko university kyivmohyla academy and kyiv polytechnic institute these are their harvard yale and mit  an extraordinarily high percentage of business and government leaders have graduated from them they know each other as in the united states just being admitted to these universities is a sign of intelligence and talent for a foreigner getting to know these elites is a lot easier than getting to know ivy leaguers in the united states
 ukraine is extremely affordable attractive inexpensive traditional markets and supermarkets of course
kyiv is a very inexpensive place to live very bottom of the big mac index the hryvnya exchange rate has fallen threefold since the start of the war in donbass prices have risen especially for imports but not nearly as much the tourist will note that it is still possible to get a decent hotel room for  a taxi anywhere in the city for  and a meal for under  that is just the start
for those of us who live here  metro ridesbuses and trams are even lessmake life cheap and convenient try the grocery store a pound for potatoes beets carrots onions and cabbage the staples of the ukrainian diet meat is generally under two dollars a pound although there is a lot of hue and cry about corruption in the energy business in the end it costs far less than in the united states  a month to heat a house and between four and five dollars a gallon for gasoline however most ukrainians utilities are included in rent and only a few drive cars
medical care is a preview of the impending obamacare disaster the state promises the moon but delivers only what it can afford the average ukrainian has to stand in a long line to get indifferent service from underequipped and underpaid doctors in shabby soviet era hospitals the flip side is that feeforservice is alive and well you can get decent care if you pay for it and it doesnt cost very much in fact ukraine is a medical tourism destination especially for fertility treatments plastic surgery and dental work
an american social security check makes you rich by local standards it is a good place to live in retirement moreover any american can teach english and there are a number of entrepreneurial opportunities that dont take a lot of capital to start
 ukrainians are fairly uniformly slavic  and they like people like themselves just us slavs
western newspapers are full of horror stories about ukraine  war and corruption leaders in moscow washington and europe love to point fingers at us to distract from the increasingly blatant corruption surrounding those in the west im no fan of corruption but given the fact that it is universal it is worth relating why ukrainian corruption is more comfortable to live with than that of the europe or the united states
there is no hypocrisy about our corruption or rather the hypocrisy is so transparent that nobody believes the lies the virtue we still have free speech ukrainians do not lose their jobs if they are politically incorrect they are not jailed if they say what they think about middle eastern immigration if you tell a woman she looks good she might actually blush and appreciate it
the corruption has kept the standard of living low which perversely has important benefits people remain traditional because they have needed the support of families just to survive asylum seeking immigrants dont come because there is nothing here for themfew jobs and nothing in the way of welfare
not having immigrants leads to high levels of social capital the people actually like and trust each other i am the only american in our little development of  homes they have included me in the groupeverybody knows me and says hello when i meet them on the street in the bus and in the stores in my toney neighborhood of bethesda maryland most neighbors were too occupied with their important jobs to bother being neighborly
the fact that it is mostly just slavs has a couple of important corollaries there are no bad neighborhoods in kyiv people will tell you to avoid the troyeshchena but a lot of people i know live there i went to see for myself i had a couple of pleasant shots of vodka chatting with the locals i cannot imagine doing that in the anacostia neighborhood of washington dc
people always stand up to give my son and me a seat on the bus or metro old ladies absolutely gush over him and engage him in small talk they support their rising generation and are tickled to death that i am raising him to be a ukrainian
lastly even though the locals will tell you otherwise ukrainians are good and polite drivers they invariably stop for you at crosswalks very few will drive after even one drink fatalities per vehicle mile are about twice as high as in the west because the roads are poor but you cant blame it on the drivers
 young people have pride in themselves an english language toastmasters meeting
students and young professionals show selfrestraint no tattoos no piercings no sloppy clothes no swearing very little smoking and no drugs they are what in the s was called squaredelightfully so they look forward to marriage and families especially the women for this reason they are perhaps not as easy as girls elsewhere but when you get one you have something of substance
there are lots of places to meet young people needless to say bars and nightclubs there are studios all over town giving inexpensive dance lessonssalsa and swing are bigand hundreds of sports clubs the english language mafia club is thriving the toastmasters public speaking club attracts many of the best and brightest with meetings in english german russian and ukrainian the language exchange club also meets in several languages from may to september the river beaches are great surrounded by restaurants bars and discos
ukrainians love to practice their english and welcome foreigners not too many make it this far east it is an easy place to make friends
 it is a good place to sit out the wests coming civil unrest one of kyivs many lovely river beaches
the western press would have you believe that kyiv is a lawless wild west that is the opposite from the truth  even today it is safer than any western capital city
the first danger cited is vladimir putin when are the russians going to invade answer they wont throughout is history russia has expanded by stealth and opportunity they stopped when finland fought back in  and georgia fought back in  they swiped the baltics and part of poland only after germany had started a war that diverted the worlds attention they imposed their will on their european satellites only because the red army conveniently occupied them at the end of world war ii
in ukraine they took the opportunity of political chaos in  to steal crimea where by treaty they already had a large military presence emboldened they thought they had an opportunity in the russianspeaking donbass but the ukrainians resisted and that war is at a standstill putin knows full well that  million ethnic russians cannot dominate  million ethnic ukrainians especially under the glare of world opinion despite what the neocons may have shouted to sway the us election the russians are not coming another comforting thought is that there is nothing here worth nuking it is a benefit of staying out of nato
there is no dependent class here to rise up when economic hardship hits hardship is already here there are no discontented minorities gypsies the most visible of them actually workthey sell flowers and work as junk dealers you cannot be a parasite if there is no blood to suck it is the united states and europe that have legions of restless unemployed who are only being pacified by government benefits and will rise up when governments can no longer afford them
ukraines corruption is well understood by everybody as much as they complain people know how to cope with it it may take bribery to get things done but they generally do get done corruption does not result in much violence occasionally some hardnosed judge or a pesky reporter gets bumped off true but in every case the victim could have explained quite clearly why he was targeted it is not like the random killing of whites by blacks in the united states or random islamic terror in western europe
ukraine has lots of land excellent agriculture abundant water reasonably good natural resources and a homogeneous and hardworking population it is not as dependent on international trade as most european countries when the world financial system collapses ukraine will come through looking pretty good they are so far down that it all looks like up and the stress lines for civil unrest simply dont exist though you may come here for the love of a wonderful woman you will find it a delightful place to make your home

536,is western civilization worth saving,"with her hollywood and silver screen career options all but dried up former charmed actress and constantly nearnaked attentionseeker rose mcgowan is now a leading feminist as you would expect this transition occurred after her looks which never approached those of costar alyssa milano had well and truly begun to fade mcgowan is not alone in making this spectacular shift pamela anderson and professional sjw natasha devon are among a growing crowd of women who rail against sexism and objectification after years of trying often very successfully to sexualize their youth
seeking to cash in on her newfound fame as an unhinged sjw rose mcgowan launched the rose army a kind of personal cult that tries to hide the overt narcissism of its creator by supporting campaigns against domestic violence and female objectification full sjw mode is just a button away for her for instance she attacked gays for not being feminist enough and probably projecting her jealousy over not landing a significant acting role for an eternity claimed an xmen movie poster promoted violence against women 
so now comes the task of reconciling the new rose mcgowan with the old one whose selfobjectification is best described by this infamous photo with exboyfriend marilyn manson

excuses excuses rose mcgowan has tried to gloss over her past history of selfobjectification and sexualization by saying she was merely a pawn of the patriarchy
mcgowan is now even blaming her past personal feuds such as with a fellow charmed actress shannen doherty on patriarchy sexism and female objectification  sadly this very public attentionseeking in which mcgowan wrote doherty an open letter comes at the same time that the latter is suffering from cancer  but you know a girls gotta attentionwhore including when another girl she used to have catfights with is about to die
rose mcgowan has a lot in common with pamela anderson ex playboy cover model anderson after an entire career made from taking her clothes off and otherwise selling her body as if she were competing for a championship has now come out against pornography  she may not be bad for a gal nearing  but her best years are a good  years behind her i would wager that pamela anderson hit  and spent the last several years in denial before she decided to lambaste an industry currently lauding nubile girls in their twenties and not her pornography addictions are bad but anderson showing these new colors in  is nothing short of a joke
andersons position can be summed up by the following two pictures
time when she did not condemn pornography 

time when she condemns pornography 

previously a lot of attention has been paid to fat or unattractive girls being feminists these activists are nominally against the sexualization of women but appear to be driven primarily by envy and the need to diminish societys praise of attractive females whilst there is a lot of truth to this it only tells part of the story the rank opportunism of feminism is perhaps better explained by women who once made a career from selling their appearances and have subsequently turned on the industries whose financial teats they used to suckle and what better time to turn on these industries whether they be the pornography film or modeling markets than when your looks no longer allow you to actively participate in them
this phenomenon runs parallel to female athletes both utilizing and complaining about their sexualization  attractive tennis players like sabine lisicki and unattractive ones like serena williams have made careers out of wearing revealing oncourt clothing which is much more for show than practicality but when the chance presents itself lisicki and others have moaned like at this years wimbledon  about how manufacturers designs make them show too much skin many of these girls may not have lost their attractiveness yet but they pick and choose when objectification is bad just like celebrities whose looks have abandoned them
its not just famous people natasha devon
many return of kings readers will remember natasha devon from her awful performance against milo yiannopoulos during a british sky news debate on fashion mannequins there seems to have been an eerie timing in devons transition from selfdescribed former model to sjw she founded a socalled body image education program in  in her midtwenties i dont know about you but this seems to be the sort of age when nonfamous models in particular face the meat grinder due to competition from younger fresher girls
as she hurtled towards  natasha devon penned an article for cosmopolitan magazine on bulimia which morphed into a regular monthly column then came the selfesteem team devon created in  frequently with government funding the selfesteem team has essentially applauded obesity britains number one health crisis and sought to reengineer what humans are programmed by evolution to find attractive
devon along with anderson and mcgowan may chalk an antiobjectification epiphany down to age experience or something similarly convenient but the changes happened neither at the height of their selfsexualization careers nor during the prewall protracted slide always be on the look out for when exactly a woman took up feminist or general sjw activism
when a woman complains about the objectification of women it usually means a she never had the goods to begin with b her goods werent enough to compete with other girls or c her goods are well and truly gone there is a delicious irony to option c as countless women will milk their looks until natureor a halfdecade of alcohol or drugfueled benderstakes them away
feminism as projection 
it is par for the course in todays political climate that our enemies describe us as sad mommas boys who play out failed encounters with women through our beliefs of anyone roosh has faced this entirely baseless criticism the most all because our opponents have been unable to actually refute what he and return of kings say
we need to turn this idea of projection against feminists even more than we have before modernday feminism is itself the domain of women seeking easy comforts from an ideology that explains away either their own faults or their most primal fears about a harsh uncertain world for women whose looks are now washedup feminism enables them to label objectification as wrong and soothe the crushing blows that come from no longer getting the attention they were used to
rather than seeing these women as twisted and evil it is better to perceive the behavior for what it is desperation and the shocking realization that they are sexually irrelevant

537,the only strategy that could have stopped donald trump,"every man who supports donald trump came to it from a different path some of you support him because of economic impoverishment or because you have seen your neighborhoods degrade from illegal immigrants  or maybe you support him because you were attacked for being politically incorrect for me and many other men we came to support trump because we shared truths about sex and the true nature of women 
the fight began in  with the southern poverty law center 
in march  after years of teaching men how to improve their sex lives through books and web sites  i was put on a list by the jewishoperated southern poverty law center for being a misogynist  i was shaken up by this because i knew that my desire to enjoy sex with beautiful women and share the truths ive learned from it put me on a path of no return either i close down shop immediately or accept that the mob would one day come pounding on my door
i decided to keep going i responded to the splc designation with an article titled my existence is becoming illegal  where i described how heterosexual sex was now a defiant political act if the male received any benefit from it
it is clear that gender hate is now a oneway street men can hate women but not the other way around men can rape women cant men can be abusive both physically and emotionally but women cant men can be misogynist but women cant be misandrist a word that is unknown to most of the american population men can be described as lazy slobs who play video games all day but women are perfect asis in a country where there are organizations trying to convince you that being fat is both healthy and beautiful male teachers get sent to poundmeintheass prison if they have sex with a student but female teachers only get a slap on the wrist if youre a man youre likely a perpetrator of hate violence and abuse to innocent american women even if you dont yet realize your thought crime but never the other way around
fast forward two years to october  witch hunts by leftists were in force rage mobs were crawling through social networking looking for racists homophobes and sexists with the aim of getting them fired i studied the people who were participating in these witch hunts and wrote one of the most important articles ive ever published what is a social justice warrior sjw 
the article was widely shared influencing how people viewed the useful idiot layer of individuals who were guided and controlled by establishment forces consisting of academia the corporate news media hollywood fortune  companies silicon valley and the billionaire owners of our politicians scratch a feminist sjw and youll find the reptilian skin of a billionaire who created the narrative she believes
i was pessimistic when i wrote the sjw article thinking wed need a full generation  years to even begin defeating such a powerful antiamerican entity  i focused on teaching men selfdefense and avoidance instead of ways to defeat them little did i know that i was defining them at their absolute peak and barely two years later a candidate who stood for the diametric opposite of social justice would win the presidency the social justice warriors havent gone away and they are rushing to fulfill the will of george soros by refusing to accept the results of a fair election but the power they have to force people to bend to their demands has been reduced along with the power of the institutions that support them
though sjwism peaked in  i had to face the full brunt of their attacks in the summer of  during the canadian stops of my lecture tour and again in february  during the international meetups  i survived those attacks and the fact that im still here right now and able to exercise my free speech on all my platformswhile youre still here participatingshows clearly how little power they really had to stop us they bruised me during the meetup outrage but i healed quickly enough to weaponize my sites to spread my support of an even bigger enemy of theirs donald trump
donald trump ground zero 
im a pessimist by nature so i didnt have much hope that the establishment would allow trump to win in the primaries even though i was confident his ideas resonated with most americans but then i noticed that he simply couldnt be knocked out no matter what his enemies did i saw him humiliate jeb bush  outcompete a resurgent ted cruz and smack down any attempt by the media to force him to display weakness by the time i attended the republican national convention in cleveland  i started to believe
the ground zero for donald trump within the manosphere was the donald trump thread on the forum created in june  by veteran member and rok contributor samseau  this is where the battle unfolded for thosuands of men over  pages long the thread has been viewed nearly  million times ideas within it have filtered out into mainstream discourse as described here  to men with bullhorns larger than i have
after significant battles in a real war medals are awarded but soldiers dont nitpick on who was the best soldier they all worked as a team to ensure victory from the general donald trump the colonels his advisers the captains major media influencers like alex jones matt drudge paul joseph watson and mike cernovich the sergeants men like myself the specialists men like samseau and on down to the private a regular commenter who contributes the occasional meme or argument in his spare time
the ego cares about how impactful one is how influential its ideas are but the team player only cares about victory for the whole whether i am a private or a sergeant i fought side by side with men in that thread and on this web site to what amounts to a modern fourthgenerational informational war that will be studied by historians in the future who would have guessed that public internet sites operating on free opensource software would have such a positive effect on not just the result of the election but on the lives of so many men who participated in it
approaching the date of the election 
two months before the election i did a youtube video urging men to vote for trump  and it resulted in nearly  unsubscribes within a day surprising even me since i thought my audience was mostly men who would automatically support a trump presidency the video echoed a lot of sentiments i shared in the article if donald trump doesnt win were screwed  where i tried to convey the danger of a hillary presidency
obama was the race president and look how badly he has damaged race relations in only eight years hillary will be the gender president the future we have in store should be absolutely clear to you if she happens to defeat trump
not only will she move to establish a technomatriarchy where men are secondclass citizens to any female but she will ensure that no movement or organization will be able to challenge her or her establishment cronies ever again this isnt a trivial matter of getting banned from a web site like twitter or youtubemany of you will be forced to escape the country for no other reason than you happening to be a man who found himself on the wrong side of the establishment
for the next month i stared at the calendar waiting for the election to happen doing what i could to push back against the narrative on twitter  then in early october an old tape was released of trump saying he grabs girls by the pussy because they let him my sister called me confused and asked if he really was a bad man i told her that the media is distorting his comments just like they distorted mine a few months earlier when their proclaimed me as a  prorape advocate  i told her not to believe the media and to judge trump by his actions and his policies not a gotcha moment that was being spun out of control to help hillarys failing campaign
i spoke to her with confidence but inside i was concerned in a politically correct world would this be the blow to sink trumps candidacy is the majority of americans actually ready to defeat political correctness thankfully trump responded strongly ignoring calls by the traitors in the republican party to step down
the first poll to come in after pussygate suggested that trumps support didnt decline the fake controversy didnt work i held my breath for the next few days to see if another tape would come out maybe of him saying the nword but none did and i knew the establishment had no more bullets this was the moment where i finally believed i felt a rush of energy on that day as my subconscious accepted that trump was going to win i did a periscope that night as if i was amped up on methamphetamine but i took no drug

from that point on it was just a matter of hanging on until finally on november  when he was elected president i was in disbelief after he won because it was only four years prior when i was attacked by the same forces that were aligned against trump i didnt have to wait long until my personal enemies were dealt a monstrous defeat by another man whom i consider on the same team as us if i made any miscalculation it was that it would take a generation or longer for us to begin pushing back against establishment forces i underestimated our own power and those of our allies in the alternative internet space
human control is a foolhardy endeavor 
the most important lesson i learned from trumps victory is how pointless it is to control human beings both their behaviors and their minds every single major institution in the united states represented by billions of dollars of economic activity and influence could not stop a populist candidate in spite of trying everything short of assassination
george soros and his billions werent effective obama and his allies werent effective the mainstream media and their dozens of outlets werent effective ceos of the biggest companies in the united states werent effective hollywood and its superstars werent effective academia and its thousands of professors werent effective social media and its censorship efforts werent effective the fbi allowing hillary to skate from real crimes wasnt effective even donald trumps own party wasnt effective in stopping him its absolutely incredible that all these forces couldnt stop one man and his believers what a disgrace to the fields of scientific management and modern propaganda for them all to fail so miserably
think right now of how much effort the antitrump forces put into stopping him from winning think of how much money they spent to guarantee their desired outcome and now think how it was all for nothing  they accomplished the very opposite of what they moved mountains to accomplish after decades of cementing their control within the country by sucking the truth and life blood from the american public
whatever term you use to describe the force that governs our existencenature god tao or so onit is clear that humans cannot control it all and that the pendulum will swing when it wants to swing that the wheel of history will turn when it wants to turn and your billions of dollars and your propaganda and your institutions can do nothing to stop it imagine how impotent george soros and his friends must feel after their limitless money and influence was all for nothing

now they have to perfect their control methods even more open their pocket books further and try to force their will upon a population as if pushing food into the mouth of someone who is already full their desire to control you is nothing but their own psychological failings of trying to alleviate their crippling fears of trying to prove to themselves and to the world that they are a somebody that they are powerful that the world must be shaped into their image that they are gods among men but it should be clear to you by now that they are not gods but sociopaths who gamed an economic system to amass huge amounts of capital and money much of that will be flushed down the drain as they continue to fight and grasp their way to unequivocal defeat or attempting to control those who do not want to be controlled
you can control human beings but only temporarily and only some of them at the end of the day humans want to do what they want to do and if you dont possess what they wish to buy they will go to someone who does no matter how much money you spend on your mechanisms of control the more you control what does not want to be controlled the more tension is created and then released in the great unraveling of which we are currently living through in previous eras that tension resulted in victorious parades on the streets but in our modern era it is in the form of online celebrations with the use of tweets and memes
if you want to be a true leader of society create an environment where humans can associate with whom they want can freely engage in commerce can create families can live in safety can search for the truth without interference and can work and play and live according to their nature put stone walls blocking their righteous will and watch them be torn down it may take a decade it may take  years but it will happen and the contraptions you used to control them will reveal not your strength but your own pathetic weakness
conclusion we are tired of being controlled leave us alone we are tired of institutions that are obsessed with controlling us of forcing us to believe in falsehoods of programming us to hate our country of pitting woman against man and black against white leave us alone let men be men and from that a new american renaissance will come forth men who are strong and good must be allowed to live their lives and if you prevent us from doing so we wont allow you to live yours we will humiliate your useful idiots we will destroy your institutions we will lash out with more than just memes
im afraid that those who stand against us are gearing up for even greater authoritarian control over us but at least now we have our man in the white house who can join us in a fight that we have already been battling for many years i cant wait to see where this fight takes us next

538,why do people become cuckservatives,"were all about selfimprovement here at return of kings a man should always be seeking to improve himself in some fashion and when he has achieved one goal he should move onto the next one in short never rest on your laurels
combining this desire for self improvement with the masculine independence and minimalist lifestyle that other writers on this fine website should inculcate in you a desire to improve yourself while being thrifty and relatively solitary as this article deals with fitness you know what im going to say personal trainers or at the very least the ones at your average commercial gym should be avoided at all costs and while most longterm fitness enthusiasts and professionals will likely either train by themselves or have one of the few trainers that knows what hes doing most of us have to train alone especially beginners who have naught but common sense to light his path but there is another option books 

yes books that simple yet elegant method of transferring knowledge directly to its viewer there are certainly plenty of books out there pertaining to the various fields of fitness and athletics but the question remains how effective is a book in physical training
as an avid reader of fitnessrelated tomes and many others but thats neither here nor there i own many of these books and i feel that their effectiveness can be judged by grouping them based on genre
weight lifting and calisthenics when i first started getting into physical culture as a young teenager i turned to the nearby commercial gym as most tyros tend to in that commercial gym i quickly found myself being attached to a wellmeaning jackass who gave me a machineheavy program that according to him would develop strength size and endurance and like most naive young men i followed him developing none of those things but lining the trainers pockets
eventually realizing that i had been lied to i embarked on a search for enlightenment coming to the various corners of the internet that deal in such interests one of the first things that i came across were books that i have repeatedly referred to in these pages and still consider to be some of the best writing on general fitness out therethe works of men such as paul wade and pavel tsatsouline upon reading books such as power to the people and the convict condidtioning series and using a bit of common sense i deduced that these books were superior than the typical tomes on fitness that the commercial gyms would sell at the counter for a few reasons
one they advocated a physical philosophy of simplicity and purity rather than advocating a julienne of exercises their routines were efficient and targeted all muscles of the body two the credentials of the men were a cut above the average writer as a maximum security convict and a spetsnaz veteran respectively i knew that these men needed to train their muscles to fighting trim for purposes of survival rather than doing curls for the girls and third they referred to the strongmen of old like maxick and eugen sandow standing on the shoulders of giants and opening my eyes to the wider world of fitness writing much of which i have further consumed
in general i would argue that writing on weightlifting and calisthenics are the most effective books on fitness as these are solitary activities and the books are typically written by one man speaking to another man thus the techniques there in are written to be easily understood and practiced by the user without a partner

martial arts as i have repeatedly stated on this website  martial arts in general should be taken with a massive grain of saltwhile im not so stupid as to say theres no point in training any sort of refined fighting style because of adrenaline and yes i have seen this boneheaded argument made i have also spent a substantial amount of time debunking the overly flowery and outright fictitious martial arts styles that many hack authors and filmmakers propagate on my own website as well as my youtube and dailymotion channels sadly thanks to martial arts being more or less an unregulated market in the united states any clown has the full legal right to proclaim himself a master
with that being said some martial arts books are effective thoroughly explaining the proper mechanics of a move andor explaining proper situations in how to use them while i have a background in proper study i have also utilized books to teach aspects of martial arts that i was not formally taughtsuch as grappling and again i sought out accomplished and legitimate fighters that were decorated in their field men like farmer burns  lessons in catch wrestling and physical culture  and masao takahashi  mastering judo  wrote detailed and efficient books for fighting in the clinch and i have also used dr sang kims books on taekwondo such as complete kicking for learning some of the more exotic kicks that my own background didnt teach me and of course i practiced on resisting opponents some of whom had been wrestlers themselves and thus could shore up my technique
the most important thing to bear in mind when using a martial arts book is that you must practice these techniques against a bagdummy at the very least and preferably with a sparring partner that will put up a fight and while this is also the case for any book on physical culture i would argue that its the most important for martial artsnamely because martial arts techniques are by definition used in panic situations in contrast weightlifting is almost always done in a state of relative calmnessnot counting the fake screaming idiots use to pump themselves up

mindsetmeditationetc books such as the kundalini meditation manual by yogi bhajan which i have only recently started to use are simultaneously the most simple and most complicated books on selfimprovement to use they are simple because in very basic terms the advice they give is basically think really hard about something but it is precisely that abstractness that can make them difficultmeditation is a nebulous concept for the best of us to grasp immediately and in some ways changing ones mindset and behavior is the most difficult thing anybody can do
while i admittedly do not have the depth of knowledge in these that i do with the other two topics i would say that these are hard to grasp but easy to practice once they have been grokked in the words of anthony burgess after all every second of every day of your life will involve you utilizing your mindset and thus its difficulty lies in the original understanding

conclusion looking at these three broad genres of male selfimprovement books we can see that they differ greatly in content but speaking from a position of experience i can safely say that to a great extent they are effective and they can teach you new things but only if you get one of the relatively few books that arent written by armchair alpha males and only if you diligently practice the information contained within them

the most abused word in the english language is need if youre reading this post i contend there is little that you actually need beyond what you currently possess you have ample electricity to power your computer in a climatecontrolled environment with running water and food in your wellstocked refrigerator why then do you always hear people talking about how they need more stuff 
humans have a deeplyrooted drive to compete with each other and advertisers capitalize on this impulse take a moment to picture the average person that you meet what do they have to take pride in buying the newest thing allows them to join the club of consumers and for a fleeting moment to be measured on an equal playing field despite their personal shortcomings the internal pain of their lifes problems dissipates for the split second they can boast superiority over everyone who doesnt have the same shiny widget 
this conspicuous consumption creates a selffulfilling egoinvestment in the broken system although borrowing money for useless luxury purchases subjugates people into debt slavery the mentality is if i paid  for this hunk of metal and im working overtime to pay it off it must be worth it  and so are other things that the commercials are telling me to buy quite literally we are working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we dont need  
if youre reading this blog you are likely a male aged  who wants to do one or more of the following quit your job travel explore a locationindependent income get yourself in shape take charge of a relationship and learn valuable life skills a minimalist mentality helps you do all of these things 
having fewer possessions forces you to properly place a higher value on experiences this will make it safer and more fulfilling to travel because you are in touch with what truly makes you happy if youre working on a side hustle or starting a business the desire for needless possessions drains your disposable income levels and prevents you from taking risks if my business fails will i have to give up my car lease preempt this loss aversion by having less to lose 
if you want to move to a better city with a higher cost of living having excess stuff sets a floor on how much rent youll pay to house your crap and in turn how much you can spend on leisure activities if youre a distractable person like me removing visual noise from your area makes you more likely to create things with your mind and less likely to fixate on your environment  
throwing or giving useless things away is a good first step since possessions have a psychic weight that you may not realize until you rid yourself of them to fully embrace this mindset you must also kill the desires that have been inculcated in you since birth cut down on your consumer impressions by watching less tv and trying to rationally dissect the techniques used in the few advertisements you encounter find fulfillment in hobbies and work rather than chasing the rush and eventual hedonic adaptation from consuming much like a drug successive bouts of consumerism create a higher baseline where your overall happiness is no different but you end up having a bunch of useless crap that ties you down 
girls can also be troublesome in this endeavor ever notice that when a girl spends extended time in your living space she beings to tell you that you need a new this or a replacement that a good friend once told me all human beings have an innate desire to create  most women cant so they redecorate limit your exposure to women who attempt to thwart a separation from consumerism ironically men likely to lead a minimalistnomadic lifestyle are simply more attractive to primesmv women think about whether the starving artist or the bottle service guy throwing money around ends up getting more ass as always watch how women behave rather than listening to what they say when they are protesting your lifestyle change 
ask yourself this if your house burned down and you had nothing but the clothes on your back what would you be worth to society and to yourself how would you feel about losing all of the possessions you own most people plugged into the matrix would rather die than think about replacing aunt gladyss vase or baby pictures they havent looked at in a decade this is an illusion once you begin to divorce yourself from this emotional investment to stuff you will implicitly place more value on your skills and past experiences 
minimalism is not a synonym for frugality or cheapness i dont wear a potato sack while pedaling a used tricycle to work every day  i simply choose to allocate my money to experiences and a few possessions that will fulfill me and advance my lifes purpose rather than enslave myself into debt for trinkets that will collect dust somewhere 
taking the red pill is about learning to separate your priorities and desires from those that society forces upon you i dont promise that adopting this mindset will make everybody happy but it will certainly help to clarify what contributes to your individual sense of self and will allow you to focus on the internal and external traits that exemplify a man of value",2016-11-05
541,donald trump rushed off stage in reno after possible assassination attempt,"by now everyone has been reminded that the media is not infallible it is composed of very fallible human beings who make mistakes with the same regularity as all the rest of us i was recently reading a bit about something in statistics called galtons problem an observational dynamic named after its discoverer sir francis galton
to state it very crudely galtons problem is a situation resulting when observers assume that certain things are separate and discrete when in fact they are not for example those who failed to predict donald trumps electoral victory assumed that social conditions in the united states were isolated from those of the rest of the world such people failed to notice the evidence of widespread public anger in many other countries most notably england italy france and hungary
sir francis galton
failure to take into consideration the big picture is still forgivable of course no one can be right all the time or even most of the time systems in the modern world suffer from too much input and data rather than too little but deliberate lying is quite another matter and it is undeniable that some mainstream media outlets have deliberately sought to conceal the truth on a variety of domestic and foreign issues rather than act as a check on governmental power the media has actually become an arm of government power enforcing doctrinal orthodoxy with a variety of carrots and sticks that have proven to be reasonably effective

individual journalists can play significant roles in this process consider a favorite example of mine the case of famed baseball player ty cobb ive been an admirer of cobb for a very long time ever since reading his autobiography as a boy something never quite felt true about all those stories that other biographers would tell about him the worst of these was sports writer al stump whose biography of cobb has now been discredited as mostly fabrication
stump was granted exclusive access to ty cobb in  and  for his biographical purposes cobb shared with him many intimate details of his life and career but instead of faithfully reproducing those recollections stump embellished slanted and outright fabricated numerous anecdotes designed to cast cobb in the worst possible light stump portrayed cobb as a southern racist cobb was from georgia a misogynist and even a murderer cobb was not alive at the time all these stories began to circulate and was unable to defend himself
to add insult to injury stumps writings were used as the basis for a terrible  film called cobb which starred tommy lee jones the film is a tissue of lies and distortions that deserved toand didflop at the box office the real ty cobb was a complex driven and highly intelligent figure who knew how to court controversy when he had to but was actually a gentleman by the standards of the era readers interested in further reading should consult the wonderful biography by charles leerhsen entitled ty cobb a terrible beauty 
a famous photo of cobb stealing third base
to begin with cobb used brains rather than brawn to beat his opponents he made careful studies of all the top players of his day and crafted strategies designed to exploit their weaknesses for example when he learned that pitcher walter johnson hated hitting batters with pitches cobb would crowd the plate to force johnson to walk him he learned how to get inside the heads of his adversaries forcing them to lose their tempers when they did cobb would steal bases right under their noses he remains one of the few players in history who knew how to steal home base

one legend about cobb that has persisted is that he was a violent brawler this is simply not true it is true that men of his era got into fistfights oftenit was part of a healthy masculine culture back thenbut he never gratuitously assaulted or struck anyone the few incidents that have been held out as examples of his misbehavior eg a fight with a black groundskeeper and assorted hotel brawls prove to be on closer inspection nothing more than the standard types of fights that physicallyminded men like him became entangled with nearly all ballplayers of his era engaged in them including babe ruth
al stumps character assassination of cobb went even further painting him as an unreconstructed southern racist who had a grudge against blacks this is completely false cobb was actually one of the few early supporters of integration in the big leagues when asked his opinion about subject by the sporting news in  he said the negro has the right to compete in sports and who is to say he has not
he had nothing but compliments for black athletes like willie mays and jackie robinson and players in the negro league whom cobb interacted with in the s confirm that there was no trace of prejudice in cobbs makeup cobb mentored younger players corresponded with fans with personalized letters and helped found a hospital and a college education fund
cobb was certainly no angel but in hindsight he was nothing more than an aggressive daring man who played professional sports at a time when things were much less regulated than they are now cobb himself may even have allowed spurious tales about himself to circulate in order to court publicity but he had a limit and complete fairy tales he would not tolerate
stumps lies have been so pervasive and persistent that the mythology surrounding cobb will take decades to undo if anything cobb was too trusting in letting a man like stump into his confidence cobb was so angry with stumps hatchet job that he was preparing to sue to prevent publication of stumps writings in  just before his death the terrible  film cobb only added more oil to the fire
malicious journalism can do serious damage sometimes the damage comes from ignorance other times from deliberate peddling of falsehood the motives for lyingwhether coming from money fame or the desire to virtue signalcan always be found if one digs below the surface in the modern era the default rule must be to seek independent confirmation of news stories and to remember that journalists are subject to the same human emotions and weaknesses as all the rest of us

542,federal jury finds uva rape hoax journalist sabrina rubin erdely and rolling stone liable for defamation,"the media is beginning to demonize the manosphere and alt right twitter has suspended multiple accounts such as milo yiannopoulos ricky vaughn and matt forney the guardian wrote a hit piece against the red pill  the media has called altright groups xenophobic racist and misogynist despite not pointing to a single piece of evidence
as antitrump rallies continue to rage across the nation in new york city philadelphia and michigan the media completely ignores all of the assaults occurring on trump voters

despite the elites attempts to destroy us we are in fact winning this battle the reasons why are simple
truth is always more powerful than falsehood we are too numerous to be effectively silenced we dont congregate on one single platform were a collection of individuals based around an ideology were high energy decisive assertive and confident men below i would like to offer the supporters of our causes some signs of hope victory is near and trump is going to lead the way
 george soros being sued for  million 
according to breitbart  along with dozens of other alternative news sites dallas police department sergeant demetrick pennie president of the dallas fallen officer foundation is suing a multitude of individuals for inciting a race war
george soros hillary clinton jesse jackson barrack obama the new black panthers and more some individuals might claim that theres no way someone can take on this collection of massively powerful and wealthy elites in a single lawsuit and they may be right however whether or not this lawsuit is successful is completely irrelevant
what matters far more is that the word is starting to get out there the president of the dallas fallen officer foundation an extremely reputable organization is taking steps to file a massive lawsuit against these individuals this will at the very least do several things
potentially serve a massive blow to the globalists show the elites that we will not back down generate huge amounts of public awareness show the average gun rights promoting masculine traditional american that they have our support and best of all the lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of texas which means that the outcome will generally be good either way
first of all theres a very high likelihood of them winning due to the case being handled in texas a highly conservative state second in the event that the case doesnt win it will likely be pursued all the way to the supreme court if this occurs expect truly amazing things to happen the reason why the president of the united states is responsible for appointing supreme court judgesand guess whos going to be president in two months
 the grubhub crash 
after matt maloney ceo of the online food delivery service grubhub proclaimed in an email that if you agree with trumps politics you should resign their stock dropped by nearly  in just a few days
since this time in addition to his companys stock tanking he has received ample backlash on sites of all manner from twitter to facebook to reddit to independent blogs to major altright news centers
this is what my fellow rok contributors and manosphere bloggers were talking about when they mentioned the tangible impact of trump voters hillarys supporters lack the characteristics necessary to make change
a burning passion and sense of purpose moral fortitude and a sense of justice selfconfidence and the courage to stand up for your rights a fucking spine this is why we will win period the antitrump crowd is based around having a massive entitlement complex a victim complex not thinking for yourself and being a blind social sheep do people like this ever have any political or financial power in the world
of course not who do you think all of the hard working businessmen are all of the entrepreneurs all of the people investing in the stock market in order to take control of their financial future hard working intelligent men who dont make excuses obviously and do you know what these are the types of men that voted for donald trump
why do you think the dow jones industrial average is at an all time high because trumps win restored faith in america
 rise of the new media 
the mainstream media has repeatedly shown to be completely incompetent in regards to actually reporting on the issues they are nothing more than a puppet show meant to distract entertain and brainwash the american public
they have consistently lied about candidates manipulated the evidence falsified facts skewed statistics and polls and defamed multiple individuals for a mere political opinion this will happen no longer
with the rise of the new media more and more men have begun establishing outlets across all platforms reddit twitter facebook youtube periscope the list goes on and on
i firmly believe that the next eight years will be looked back on by historians as one of the most important times in all of humanitys time on this earth 
america has brought the world stability we have stood as a symbol and an ideal for other countries to follow we are a monolith of free speech bravery and economic prosperityand the elites have tried to destroy all of this to satisfy their greedy little egos
the men of america will not have this over the past  years cough obamas presidency cough we have seen an exponential increase in not only the quantity of alternative news outlets but also the quality
sites that were merely blogs a few years ago have evolved into fullblown news syndicates with live reporting onsite video footage and actual news anchors this is literally the people fighting back we want freedom of speech and we will have it
while the mainstream media draws its final breath theyre proclaiming that theres this new radical whitenationalist group called the altright in an attempt to make us look like evil fascists in fact i just had somebody threaten to kill me on twitter  but was he banned of course not
this repeated favoring of violent mentally ill leftists makes it very clear what the msms agenda istotal control and a complete suppression of our freedoms of speech sorry but the alternative media isnt going to let this happen
 massive boycotts of antitrump companies 
the lefts hypocrisy never ceases to amaze me somehow they can completely legally destroy an independent family owned business for simply refusing to bake a gay couple a cake but when trump supporters simply boycott a multibillion dollar conglomerate were the ones that are hateful
in response to several ceos statements regarding trumps racism and hate the men and women who voted for donald trump decided to simply boycott them despite this completely legal and antiviolent response the left is up in arms
here is a list of companies whose ceos have been caught attacking donald trump and his proamerican policies
pepsico they own pepsi lays mountain dew starbucks and more nabisco their brands include oreo chips ahoy ritz and more netflix macys ben  jerrys each and every single one of these companies has either spoken out against trump directly has refused to do business with trump or has moved factory production outside of the us such as nabisco which has started moving production to mexico some companies such as ben  jerrys have even openly supported the terrorist movement black lives matter 
again what do these actions signify in trump supporters power assertiveness courage a willingness to take action this is why donald trump wonhis supporters are grown ups not little babies who want more safe spaces and antifree speech zones
when donald trumps voters get oppressed by the biased controlled media or by elite globalists they dont whine or cry about it they just do something they protest and stop supporting companies that are shipping our jobs away they speak out in a logical rational way against the anger and hatred that the left has towards white men
they take their lives into their own hands rather than relying on a stupid system that caters to cry babies and whiners they take their health into their own hands they take their finances into their own hands and they take their relationships into their own hands
they dont wait around for someone else to do it for themthey get it done themselves this is why trump got into office and this is why were going to make america great again

543,dont believe the myth that weightlifting will slow you down,"home this month popular the path men took to trump the path men took to trump 
daryush roosh valizadeh created rok in october  you can visit his blog at rooshvcom or follow him on twitter and facebook rss november   politics 
every man who supports donald trump came to it from a different path some of you support him because of economic impoverishment or because you have seen your neighborhoods degrade from illegal immigrants  or maybe you support him because you were attacked for being politically incorrect for me and many other men we came to support trump because we shared truths about sex and the true nature of women  the fight began in  with the southern poverty law center 
in march  after years of teaching men how to improve their sex lives through books and web sites  i was put on a list by the jewishoperated southern poverty law center for being a misogynist  i was shaken up by this because i knew that my desire to enjoy sex with beautiful women and share the truths ive learned from it put me on a path of no return either i close down shop immediately or accept that the mob would one day come pounding on my door 
i decided to keep going i responded to the splc designation with an article titled my existence is becoming illegal  where i described how heterosexual sex was now a defiant political act if the male received any benefit from it 
it is clear that gender hate is now a oneway street men can hate women but not the other way around men can rape women cant men can be abusive both physically and emotionally but women cant men can be misogynist but women cant be misandrist a word that is unknown to most of the american population men can be described as lazy slobs who play video games all day but women are perfect asis in a country where there are organizations trying to convince you that being fat is both healthy and beautiful male teachers get sent to poundmeintheass prison if they have sex with a student but female teachers only get a slap on the wrist if youre a man youre likely a perpetrator of hate violence and abuse to innocent american women even if you dont yet realize your thought crime but never the other way around 
fast forward two years to october  witch hunts by leftists were in force rage mobs were crawling through social networking looking for racists homophobes and sexists with the aim of getting them fired i studied the people who were participating in these witch hunts and wrote one of the most important articles ive ever published what is a social justice warrior sjw  
the article was widely shared influencing how people viewed the useful idiot layer of individuals who were guided and controlled by establishment forces consisting of academia the corporate news media hollywood fortune  companies silicon valley and the billionaire owners of our politicians scratch a feminist sjw and youll find the reptilian skin of a billionaire who created the narrative she believes 
i was pessimistic when i wrote the sjw article thinking wed need a full generation  years to even begin defeating such a powerful antiamerican entity  i focused on teaching men selfdefense and avoidance instead of ways to defeat them little did i know that i was defining them at their absolute peak and barely two years later a candidate who stood for the diametric opposite of social justice would win the presidency the social justice warriors havent gone away and they are rushing to fulfill the will of george soros by refusing to accept the results of a fair election but the power they have to force people to bend to their demands has been reduced along with the power of the institutions that support them 
though sjwism peaked in  i had to face the full brunt of their attacks in the summer of  during the canadian stops of my lecture tour and again in february  during the international meetups  i survived those attacks and the fact that im still here right now and able to exercise my free speech on all my platformswhile youre still here participatingshows clearly how little power they really had to stop us they bruised me during the meetup outrage but i healed quickly enough to weaponize my sites to spread my support of an even bigger enemy of theirs donald trump donald trump ground zero 
im a pessimist by nature so i didnt have much hope that the establishment would allow trump to win in the primaries even though i was confident his ideas resonated with most americans but then i noticed that he simply couldnt be knocked out no matter what his enemies did i saw him humiliate jeb bush  outcompete a resurgent ted cruz and smack down any attempt by the media to force him to display weakness by the time i attended the republican national convention in cleveland  i started to believe 
the ground zero for donald trump within the manosphere was the donald trump thread on the forum created in june  by veteran member and rok contributor samseau  this is where the battle unfolded for thosuands of men over  pages long the thread has been viewed nearly  million times ideas within it have filtered out into mainstream discourse as described here  to men with bullhorns larger than i have 
after significant battles in a real war medals are awarded but soldiers dont nitpick on who was the best soldier they all worked as a team to ensure victory from the general donald trump the colonels his advisers the captains major media influencers like alex jones matt drudge paul joseph watson and mike cernovich the sergeants men like myself the specialists men like samseau and on down to the private a regular commenter who contributes the occasional meme or argument in his spare time 
the ego cares about how impactful one is how influential its ideas are but the team player only cares about victory for the whole whether i am a private or a sergeant i fought side by side with men in that thread and on this web site to what amounts to a modern fourthgenerational informational war that will be studied by historians in the future who would have guessed that public internet sites operating on free opensource software would have such a positive effect on not just the result of the election but on the lives of so many men who participated in it approaching the date of the election 
two months before the election i did a youtube video urging men to vote for trump  and it resulted in nearly  unsubscribes within a day surprising even me since i thought my audience was mostly men who would automatically support a trump presidency the video echoed a lot of sentiments i shared in the article if donald trump doesnt win were screwed  where i tried to convey the danger of a hillary presidency 
obama was the race president and look how badly he has damaged race relations in only eight years hillary will be the gender president the future we have in store should be absolutely clear to you if she happens to defeat trump 
not only will she move to establish a technomatriarchy where men are secondclass citizens to any female but she will ensure that no movement or organization will be able to challenge her or her establishment cronies ever again this isnt a trivial matter of getting banned from a web site like twitter or youtubemany of you will be forced to escape the country for no other reason than you happening to be a man who found himself on the wrong side of the establishment 
for the next month i stared at the calendar waiting for the election to happen doing what i could to push back against the narrative on twitter  then in early october an old tape was released of trump saying he grabs girls by the pussy because they let him my sister called me confused and asked if he really was a bad man i told her that the media is distorting his comments just like they distorted mine a few months earlier when their proclaimed me as a  prorape advocate  i told her not to believe the media and to judge trump by his actions and his policies not a gotcha moment that was being spun out of control to help hillarys failing campaign 
i spoke to her with confidence but inside i was concerned in a politically correct world would this be the blow to sink trumps candidacy is the majority of americans actually ready to defeat political correctness thankfully trump responded strongly ignoring calls by the traitors in the republican party to step down 
the first poll to come in after pussygate suggested that trumps support didnt decline the fake controversy didnt work i held my breath for the next few days to see if another tape would come out maybe of him saying the nword but none did and i knew the establishment had no more bullets this was the moment where i finally believed i felt a rush of energy on that day as my subconscious accepted that trump was going to win i did a periscope that night as if i was amped up on methamphetamine but i took no drug 
from that point on it was just a matter of hanging on until finally on november  when he was elected president i was in disbelief after he won because it was only four years prior when i was attacked by the same forces that were aligned against trump i didnt have to wait long until my personal enemies were dealt a monstrous defeat by another man whom i consider on the same team as us if i made any miscalculation it was that it would take a generation or longer for us to begin pushing back against establishment forces i underestimated our own power and those of our allies in the alternative internet space human control is a foolhardy endeavor 
the most important lesson i learned from trumps victory is how pointless it is to control human beings both their behaviors and their minds every single major institution in the united states represented by billions of dollars of economic activity and influence could not stop a populist candidate in spite of trying everything short of assassination 
george soros and his billions werent effective obama and his allies werent effective the mainstream media and their dozens of outlets werent effective ceos of the biggest companies in the united states werent effective hollywood and its superstars werent effective academia and its thousands of professors werent effective social media and its censorship efforts werent effective the fbi allowing hillary to skate from real crimes wasnt effective even donald trumps own party wasnt effective in stopping him its absolutely incredible that all these forces couldnt stop one man and his believers what a disgrace to the fields of scientific management and modern propaganda for them all to fail so miserably 
think right now of how much effort the antitrump forces put into stopping him from winning think of how much money they spent to guarantee their desired outcome and now think how it was all for nothing  they accomplished the very opposite of what they moved mountains to accomplish after decades of cementing their control within the country by sucking the truth and life blood from the american public 
whatever term you use to describe the force that governs our existencenature god tao or so onit is clear that humans cannot control it all and that the pendulum will swing when it wants to swing that the wheel of history will turn when it wants to turn and your billions of dollars and your propaganda and your institutions can do nothing to stop it imagine how impotent george soros and his friends must feel after their limitless money and influence was all for nothing 
now they have to perfect their control methods even more open their pocket books further and try to force their will upon a population as if pushing food into the mouth of someone who is already full their desire to control you is nothing but their own psychological failings of trying to alleviate their crippling fears of trying to prove to themselves and to the world that they are a somebody that they are powerful that the world must be shaped into their image that they are gods among men but it should be clear to you by now that they are not gods but sociopaths who gamed an economic system to amass huge amounts of capital and money much of that will be flushed down the drain as they continue to fight and grasp their way to unequivocal defeat or attempting to control those who do not want to be controlled 
you can control human beings but only temporarily and only some of them at the end of the day humans want to do what they want to do and if you dont possess what they wish to buy they will go to someone who does no matter how much money you spend on your mechanisms of control the more you control what does not want to be controlled the more tension is created and then released in the great unraveling of which we are currently living through in previous eras that tension resulted in victorious parades on the streets but in our modern era it is in the form of online celebrations with the use of tweets and memes 
if you want to be a true leader of society create an environment where humans can associate with whom they want can freely engage in commerce can create families can live in safety can search for the truth without interference and can work and play and live according to their nature put stone walls blocking their righteous will and watch them be torn down it may take a decade it may take  years but it will happen and the contraptions you used to control them will reveal not your strength but your own pathetic weakness conclusion 
we are tired of being controlled leave us alone we are tired of institutions that are obsessed with controlling us of forcing us to believe in falsehoods of programming us to hate our country of pitting woman against man and black against white leave us alone let men be men and from that a new american renaissance will come forth men who are strong and good must be allowed to live their lives and if you prevent us from doing so we wont allow you to live yours we will humiliate your useful idiots we will destroy your institutions we will lash out with more than just memes 
im afraid that those who stand against us are gearing up for even greater authoritarian control over us but at least now we have our man in the white house who can join us in a fight that we have already been battling for many years i cant wait to see where this fight takes us next nov   roosh valizadeh",2016-11-06

but i also find myself observing and appreciating all the little things around me i always have to keep my camera nearby because i often want to photograph something ive noticed in my daily routine the pattern on a sewer lid a reflection in a puddle birds perched in a tree and so forth 
my prephotographer self just like most of the rest of the world would have walked right past these things without a care in the world yet now i can be entertained from the most minuscule and simple things especially if my camera is handy the world is full of photogenic things if can just teach yourself to notice them  help preserve history 
since its inception photography has always been one of the most moving ways to preserve history in our rapidly changing modern times photos touch people in a way other media cant both photography and video are both visual arts but photographs differ in that they capture merely one frame of what is going on yet one frame is all one needs to feel taken back to another time 
with the advent of the smartphone photography is as accessible as ever while this sounds good on paper the truth is our worlds becoming more and more flooded with garbage and narcissistic photographs our world needs more adventurous and welltrained photographers out there taking photos of the modern world we live in and the rapid changes its undergoing these are the photos that will be cherished decades down the road not all the shitty selfies that bog down social media  travel experiences will be more meaningful 
photography goes with traveling like bread goes with butter it took me nearly five years of traveling internationally to finally get serious about doing photography on my trips and after i got started i never looked back 
rather than traveling for escapism and hedonism im traveling to learn about and document our world as a result my trips feel much more meaningful and fulfilling than they ever did before the way you see and come to understand a country as a photographer is quite different than if you werent one 
i now divide my history of travel experiences into two separate groupsthe trips i had before i owned a dslr camera and the trips i had after buying one photography is so fun and addicting that i find myself wanting to go back to all those predslr camera destinations even the ones i didnt enjoy all that much just so i can reexperience them with a camera in hand  an opportunity to meet new people 
one thing i always try to do when i travel is meet fellow photographers whether they be foreign or local i appreciate talking to people with an observational eye as they can provide me with unique insight that nonphotographers rarely can 
but photography doesnt just help you meet other photographers it helps you meet other people from all walks of life ive had regular people on the street come up and talk to me once they saw i was taking photos ive also met people from online for no other reason than they liked my work 
being a good photographer can also be a great way to meet women theyre not gonna start blowing you as soon as they see your awesome pictures but dont be surprised if you discover some newfound female admiration once your excellent photography skills are out in the open and if you can make a woman look beautiful in a photo shell admire you in a way you never imagined  a blog with an edge 
in the diverse world of independently run blogs how many bloggers do you know who can both write well and photograph well i can literally only think of one  and the fact that this blogger is just as good at utilizing a camera as he is at wielding a pen or rather a keyboard puts his website in a league of its own in terms of quality content 
though i still highly respect the good bloggers out there for their amazing writing skills and insights i think theyre doing both their readers and websites a great disservice by merely using stock photos or shitty shotwithacellphone photos in their articles 
readers can definitely tell the difference when a blogger takes all of their own photos with a nice dslr camera start taking nice dslrshot photos and see for yourself how they can enhance your articles theyll give you just that much more of an edge over all the other bloggers who dont  youll also have an edge over  of others on social media and dating sites 
since everyone else is posting lame smartphonetaken shots all over their social media accounts your dslrshot photos could shine like diamonds in the rough the same way you stand above  of other men by lifting weights regularly the same advantage can be expected by not taking cheap shortcuts with your social mediabound photography your facebook instagram and twitter accounts will all look better than ever before 
this is also true for dating websites and apps where most chumps just take some lame mirror selfies with their smartphone and then upload them to their accounts dudes with welltaken nontraditional photos stand out big time dont just take my word for it as there has actually been plenty of discussion about these benefits over at the roosh v forum  
and although they can be very helpful you dont actually need another photographer with you to get some good shots of yourself rather all you need is your camera an autofocus lens a tripod a remote shutter and a creative eye  a resumeenhancing marketable skill 
photography isnt just mentally rewarding it can also be financially rewarding if you play your cards right the field of profitable photography may be vast and highly competitive but one things for sure  the demand for new photographs is infinite the world never stops turning after all stock portrait wedding wildlife travel sports and news photography are just a few of the most in demand and profitable niches 
but if you really wanna make money selling your photographs you gotta make a name for yourself by sharpening your skills and networking with the right people a great photographer who no one knows exists wont make any money 
my father is an outdoorsman slash wildlife photographer with decades of experience tens of thousands of photos and a giant network of contacts from his industry it seems like magazine and website editors are always knocking on his door because they know he probably has a nice shot of exactly what theyre looking for often all he has to do is dig through his archives and boomhes made  bucks conclusion 
stop dreaming about it and just give photography a shot already borrow your friend or a family members dslr camera for the weekend and just get out there and take pictures of anything that strikes your fancy 
photography takes decades to master but it all begins with a single click of the shutter button yet sometimes all it takes is one little click to realize youve been missing out on something very big and meaningful your entire life youll never know until you try",2016-11-06
545,relentless media censorship is brining us a fate worse than big brother,"more people are coming to the truthful conclusion that globalism is a failure and nationalism where a countrys people and interests are valued above that of noncitizens is the way forward a problem is that the globalismnationalism framework is exactly the type of dialectic elites can use to usher in a global war or crackdown to further increase their power
imagine there is a wife who is tired of her husband going out every night with his friends to drink instead of nagging at him every evening which would have the effect of motivating him to leave the house even sooner she will wait until he gets into a drunk driving accident or serious bar fight so she could draw the line and make the reasonable ultimatum for him to never drink again the husband is more likely to listen to her after something wrong takes place than after he had a safe night out
right now the nationalist movement is being allowed to gain strength so that a future event can act as a trigger for globalists to draw the line on the movement by imprisoning or killing its strongest members in other words globalists plan to use nationalism as a trap a device they transform into to their advantage as of right now the budding nationalist movement is extremely useful in allowing them to identify all resisters before easily crushing them when the time is right
elites cannot advance their plans without a dialectic 
the way the elites move an agenda forward is through a dialectic  meaning that two opposing ideologies rub against each other create friction and from that comes a desired result ie order from chaos those in power either control or monitor the existence of both sides to guide and bend the dialectic to serve their ends
the recent rise in nationalism i speculate has been allowed because previous dialectics such as capitalism vs communism and democracy vs terrorism are no longer useful in advancing the desired agenda soviet communism is dead and increased terrorism did not allow planned wars in syria and iran to proceed like  did with iraq and afghanistan in addition the white vs black race war is years late stubbornly resistant to the gasoline that obama pours onto the fire a new dialectic must be nurtured and so nationalism may just do the trick hillarys recent alt right speech officially debuted american nationalism as the new enemy
while your conclusion that nationalism is logical and beneficial to a nation is true and im sure to agree with it you were guided onto those beliefs how did you arrive at nationalist thought through decades of free trade feminism and opendoor immigration that have worn you and your country down your arrival at nationalist conclusions is the direct result of globalism which means that nationalist thoughts exist in your mind only because of the likes of george soros who pulled out a million muslims from his hat and placed them in europe while sponsoring a multitude of social justice organizations in the united states his actions and behavior along with other powerful globalists like him have essentially created your very ideology because you are entrenched in a dialectic where opposing forces must exist and be in combat with each other
the growth of nationalism is useful nationalism must continue to grow in power right before the moment it can threaten globalist banking and geopolitical interests and when it does the globalists will clamp down severely on it as if replaying world war  they will identify a nationalist country as the big bad bully and then use that country as an excuse to start a war that will simultaneously weed out nationalists throughout the world by sending them to die or having them arrested at home for subversion or treason russia is the evil nationalist country that neocons and others have been poking and even poland is being puffed up into an undemocratic country in order to hedge their bets

a hint that this may already be taking place is that france recently called upon patriots to serve in their national guard to protect citizens since when does france care about patriots they have committed no consistent actions in the past decade that suggest they do care so we must reasonably conclude that this new army is a trap to attract nationalists into a game where the end result is their death i wouldnt be surprised if frances beefedup army is used to start a war in a place like poland which will be painted as an aggressor that caused economic attacks upon the saintly western europeans
as long as youre in the dialectic which i see as a sort of twilight zone creation of the mega rich youre fighting on their terms they need the nationalist grassroots uprising to create violent events that allow them to reassert control and power even though nationalism may be the most sane movement of the day it still plays into their hands as long as we insist on having only two sides of the debate good and evil as if we were living in a hollywoodstyle storyline instead of this twodimensional arrangement the solution may be to go d where you can move front and back and around in a spectrum of ideas instead of just left and right where youre a pawn of the game no matter what side you pick
just because a nationalist resistance is growing doesnt mean that that the globalists in power are being hurt without being able to effectively control the western population through the cold war terrorism racial divideandconquer or modern russian aggression they are hoping that the nationalist movement grows enough to create the conflict that moves their chess pieces forward while im not urging you to throw away your nationalist beliefs as i surely wont throw away mine it is clear to me that a trap is waiting to be sprung and we will all suffer when its finally launched

546,what françois de la rochefoucauld has to teach us about cynicism,"its now been over a week since the most glorious victory ever recorded in the war against rapacious globalism and lunatic cultural marxismthe election of donald trump to the presidency of the united states like many of you i was outside with my fellow tribesmen  the same tribe our opponents tried to shut down in february  until about  am on election day as you may expect it was a joyous occasion that ill never forget

yet as i remarked at the time while this was a glorious victory a decisive one that ended the campaign the war would continue i had hoped to be as magnanimous as possible in victory to finally bridge some divides and begin to move past the insanity weve been dealing with thats accelerated in the past few years however as has quickly become apparent the cultural marxists sjws and their globalist overlords have no intention of coming to terms or engaging in meaningful selfreflection anytime soon instead theyre doubling down on everything that voters resoundingly rejected on november th
predictably there have been protests and some riots incidents of violence on the left have taken place and gone underreported just as predictably most of these protests are professionally organized  with george soros likely pulling at least a few of the strings learning nothing the regressive leftists taking to the streets complete with their year zero pathology think themselves morally justified in blocking streets and attacking people because theyre on a mission to purify society anything that stands in the way of that mission can be justly eliminated 
i came across one of these protests a few days ago it was generic and small basic bitch shit really but recall that these are merely the peons in the army of their overlords their intensity will dissipate with time the safetypin wearing safespace occupying neonhaired freaks arent the ones to take note of on the grand strategic map the bigger picture to focus on is the drive toward increased censorship in the past few days
the recent counteroffensive began with the uproar over donald trumps selection of steve bannon to be his chief white house strategist the media and its acolytes on social media went into another coordinated attack lambasting bannon and breitbart  which he ran as having connections to the altright which in turn they say is associated with white nationalism to reinforce this pairing the media ran with a couple of the most controversial breitbart headlines
if you recognize this tactic its because the media ab tested this against roosh in february they took the  how to stop rape  headline said that it proved that roosh was prorape and then repeated endlessly
this is actually a sort of hypnosis trick and was certainly done deliberately scott adams calls this wordthinking 
rational people use data and reason to arrive at truth this group is mostly imaginary
wordthinkers use labels word definitions and analogies to create the illusion of rational thinking this group is  of the world
persuaders use simplicity repetition emotion habit aspirations visual communication and other tools of persuasion to program other people and themselves this group is about  of the population and effectively control the wordthinkers of the world
he further describes the phenomenon of wordthinking 
wordthinking is important to persuasion because if you can convince someone to accept a label on an opponent it turns off their critical thought and turns on their confirmation bias nuance is lost context is lost all that matters once the label is accepted is whatever qualities the label already contained
and this is what the media is doing they did it with roosh and are now doing their damndest to do it to bannon no doubt as one of the thousand paper cuts they hope to use to take president trump down
because the term altright is relatively fresh its vulnerable to being defined with the most ominous dark terms possible which is why the media is trying furiously to create as much connective tissue between it and white nationalism as possible remember with wordthinking nuance and context are lost
and now that this first step has been achieved where it was meant to the selfanointed moral cover for the more alarming stage of the counteroffensive is underway now that the ambiguous and ominoussounding altright has been attempted to be extensively defined the solution is obviously to crack down on it and anyone having to do with it even if they really dont given this pretext the purges and censorship have begun with numerous prominent twitter accounts being suspended agree with these accounts or not i often dont it should give you pause that this kind of blanket censorship is being implemented if youre just a little bit politically unorthodox youre now at heightened risk of being slapped with the altright label even if youre on record as not identifying with it and banned from outlets of communication that are both vital for pushing your ideas forward and for promoting any business you have
but banning individuals is only stage one stage two is the recent drive by google facebook twitter and others to censor what they call fake news the media has been on a blitz against these fake news articles completely unironically given that this is the same crowd that uncritically signal boosted the rolling stone rape hoax to the ends of the world fact checks donald trumps comment that hillary clinton acid washed her private email server selectively edits clips to promote the narrative that their pets in black lives matter are entirely peaceful when they arent  and fails to disclose contacts and relationships with officials of the democratic national committee while writing about the campaign
no this is not the onion
while this drive deserves to be a subject of laughter we must nevertheless still take it seriously there have already been reports of shadow bans on twitter with prominent figures such as mike cernovich and scott adams and its far from out of the question that a blacklist of sorts gets put up for outlets such as return of kings  which were crucial in taking control of the narrative during the campaign all the while the media continues to nitpick inflate and manufacture anything they can turn into a controversy about the incoming trump administration narrative warfare is far from over
what can we do fortunately we have a master persuader in donald trump to lead the way but we at the grassroots the grunts in the trenches if you will must continue our efforts
first we need to begin to dehypnotize those that can be scott adams had some thoughts on that  but here are the crucial points
 the basis of the hypnosis in recent days has been around pairing the terms altright and fake news with all sorts of bad things
 take away that pairing and youve made significant inroads
ive ab tested this sort of thing numerous times remember mike cernovichs maxim that conflict is attention and attention is influence here are a few pointers
 just like with women frame control is paramount the inevitable tactic that theyll try to use is to associate anyone opposed to them with the worst elements of their side fortunately our opponents have arguably worse elements given their blanket of moral superiority and cultural influence refocus the frame on those make them own their own worst elements
 appeal to vanity most people like to think of themselves as rational tell them that their wordthinking is literally shutting down their critical thinking skills i did this with a girl after the first debate explaining to her that because the movie in her head pictured a mexican in a certain way her critical thinking skills turned off and that what trump said about the mexican judge would be equally applicable to someone of another heritage like german its a long story but her face was a picture tell them that theyre seeing things not based on reality but on the movies playing in their heads triggered by a certain word then watch the cognitive dissonance come
on the broader level heres what we can do
 continue on as usual continue to make a cultural impact get those websites books movies and so on out there echoing what one member of the forum said politics is air cover culture is the ground war they can try to censor fake news all they want but we are too numerous to control if we dont cooperate its now time to redouble our efforts
 dont talk to any aggrieved victimhood class on social media if theyre acting hostile to you theyll use any excuse to ban you law  disdain things you cannot have ignoring them is the best revenge
 begin to build new networks gab is up and coming and is far more free speech friendly
 i will echo what many others have said on the forum make fun of them theyre a prime target for humor believe me when i say most people are sick of the special snowflakes on the street as well as the media

this is a time of great opportunity but we need to readjust for the new moves our opponents are making theyre doing everything they can to censor us and delegitimize trump thats the next focus of the campaign we must delegitimize them in turn
but take heart that were now in the ascendant otherwise they wouldnt be making these moves i recall when i first visited return of kings and the forum nearly four years ago there was a general malaise in the atmosphere day after day it seemed we were suffering another defeat no longer

547,reasons why youre not happy,"convinced that previous snow plowing policies were sexist the city government of the swedish capital of stockholm recently implemented a feminist system for clearing it it ended in disaster and the city came to an absolute standstill for a start four times as many people than usual were hospitalized for snowrelated injuries nearly as importantly countless workers most of them men were prevented from getting to work it would appear that the patriarchybacked snow won as local politicians ended up apologizing for the havoccausing changes
havoc like this

forgetting that motor vehicles are often more impeded by snow than pedestrians and create a greater safety risk municipal resources which had already been increased were diverted to clearing bicycle paths and sidewalks and away from main roads areas like schools were also prioritized which again ignores the frequently greater ease of walking in snow than driving in it plus the longer distances car commuters face compared to children mothers and other women walking to places the situation is quite plainly moronic for a further reason nonmain roads and other parts of a city take up much more space meaning that the swedish capitals snow removal teams were targeting a far larger less densely used zone to boot this was all during a november already breaking records for snowfall 
the saga in stockholm reads like an microcosm of feminism itself an overeducated meaning undereducated group of leftists come together create data based on feelings and produce a plan of action that screws up an entire community feminists in stockholm had previously complained that the thoroughfares cleaned up first and most extensively by snowplows were the ones heavily used by men how they came to this conclusion is unclear but given the shutdown of the city that resulted from the feminist changes it wasnt based on any solid reasoning with private cars and public transport vehicles alike unable to move in many cases the femalefriendly snowclearing ended up adversely impacting far more people including women than the old one
well done feminists and white knights
what this says about sweden is it really surprising that one of the people responsible for stockholms femalefriendly snow plowing scandal mayor karin wanngård is a feminist and career politician who first joined the council in her teens
because sweden is perhaps the most concentrated welfare state in the world not having people at their jobs and instead stuck in snow is a very bad thing how can a country continue to pay such a large bill for handouts with elected representatives of the caliber of stockholms trying to ruin things sweden is also home to a growing class of lowskilled migrant communities including many tens of thousands from the most recent mediterranean waves last year its recent migrant population is now essentially the same proportionallyspeaking as states more typically associated with multiculturalism such as canada and australia and nonethnic swedes in sweden tend to come from more troublesome cultures compared to the more assimilationfriendly east asians and indians emigrating to canada and australia
how sweden intends to deal with issues like this while balancing urgent economic needs remains to be seen especially with braindead initiatives like the snow plow fiasco taking precedence add to the mix the recent creation of a mansplaining hotline by a swedish labor union and you start to see the real problems scandinavias most basketcase society is trying to solve
so who was organizing the snow plowingand actually doing it yup you guessed it its a man driving
theres no doubt that the feminist snow plowing scheme was an unmitigated disaster and its also extremely likely that the vast majority of people tasked with clearing stockholms streets are men oh the irony not only do feminist politicians try to preference women in the removal of snow they expect men to do the work in achieving it just as sanitation workers and garbage collectors are invariably male dont expect to catch too many female snowplow operators and other snowclearing employees in stockholm
wake up sweden swedish multiculturalism in action
stockholms snow removal catastrophe is emblematic of a country refusing to deal with its real malaise while the men who built sweden are categorized as wouldbe oppressors swedish society itself is close to breaking point even stockholms central train station is now terribly unsafe and various city police forces have long made it known that they do not have control of many suburbs in particular malmö swedens third city and certain districts of stockholm are notorious for ethnic ghettos gang violence rape and other crime
but no mansplaining hotlines and not removing snow in a new feminist way are the clear and present dangers most swedes should fear at night

548,watch how i make my own bread at home with a bread machine,"as feminism erodes down to its tattooed lesbian core we should stop and take a moment to wonder what the point of the third wave part of feminism was although it ultimately proves destructive to western societies to give women equality at least the first and second wave had something legitimate to bitch about third wave feminism not so much and today well talk about the underlying motives and the end game of it all
when one looks at modern feminism you see women who have flipped the script to use their term and rewired life so that men are not necessary for them a modern feminist has her own job that can meet her needs but maybe not all her wants and has her own small place with her cats and netflix when she wants the company of men she goes out and sluts it up and is always successful due to the biological imperative of men
on the surface a feminist woman may appear to be the analog of a red pill man yet upon closer examination she is actually an imperfect copy a man works harder more dangerous jobs and makes more money because of it thus he has money for anything he wants and more a proper man has interesting hobbies and a healthy fit lifestyle and he must do this to fulfill his potential and inner drive but also because he realizes that normal men do not get laid due to hypergamy and he must be the best he can be if he wants to be successful with women
however the most crucial difference lies in the outcome women who outlast their shelf lives while still being single are miserable and i fully expect the suicide rate of women of my generation to skyrocket in about  years from now men whose value is based on their production and can enjoy a later in life peak than women also can live for other things than companionship and family and can be quite happy on their own even if they did want a family at one time or still do
so the question is if women despite their feminist pandering to the contrary actually do want a man to live with and grow old with why is third wave feminism devoted to stopping that in every which way the answer like most things lies in the red pill philosophy women including feminists only want the best men modern feminism is nothing more than a nuclearlevel shit test
a woman needs an alpha man like a fish needs water sjw society today tells us that men are not supposed to hit on women in the grocery store in the bookstore or at the coffee shop because thats a precursor to stalking or some shit at night youre not supposed to hit on girls at the bar or club because they are there with the friends and not looking for that at work youre not even supposed to talk to women about anything other than workrelated topics because thats harassment
if you are wondering where is a guy supposed to meet girls then you get the point and the answer is that youre not feminists and women in general know that any man who actually allows them to regulate his behavior is not a man worth having in the first place so they are only interested in men that see that the answer to feminisms constraints is to ignore them in the first place

combining the above shit test with hypergamy will result in a winning combo if a man is successful good looking and alpha enough he has a good chance of pulling another mans wife directly out of their marriage and family and taking her away women are ultimately interested only in their own self interest and that means when confronted with the best man she has ever beheld she will go against feminism because it is not in her own best self interest at the time and instead be receptive to the man in hopes of snaring him
ultimately women do still need and want men they just dont want to be bothered by inferior men and third wave feminism does a good job of convincing the betas to stay away until they are wanted for their paychecks by postwall nascarstyle wrecks of women
when is enough enough when you look at feminism logically which is hard you can come up with the premise that women have been disadvantaged over history and feminism is an effort to balance the scales they will disguise it in selfdepreciating irony feminism is the radical notion that men and women are equal but what they really men is that men and women should be equal over the balance of history and since women have been so disadvantaged men had better get ready for some suck to square the accounts
i bet shes been in  rok articles by now
the question then follows if men owe women how much are we talking can it ever be paid off or have women been so heinously treated over the entirety of our existence that there will never be enough atonement to make up for it i have three theories
it could be that men have apparently treated women so badly for all time that it can never be paid off because its an absolute the problem with absolutes is they lack scope the worst atrocities in history have been borne by both men and women alike and it could be said that men have borne the heavier half as they are usually expected to die before defeat in war whereas women although they get raped by the conquerors at least get to live i doubt most women have been treated that badly though on the balance so there is probably some finite amount of penance men would do to restore equality
the other two theories center on the idea that eventually men will atone for all faults perceived by feminism and the only difference lies in what happens then my second idea is not a noble one but it is probably the most accurate feminists you see are not for equality they are for female supremacy and once equality is reached women will get to be on top for millennia some would say we are already at that point and this is why anyone who is not a feminist can see why the movement has faltered and lost whatever relevance it ever had when you already have it all shouldnt you stop and try to actually make things equal that is if you actually have moral integrity
thats the third idea the concept of once all debts are paid true equality would rule i doubt this one would ever happen as our victimhoodempowerment culture makes it advantageous to be a victim and you cant be a victim if your demographic is on top plus being feelers not thinkers the average woman lacks the intellectual capacity to be honest with themselves
conclusion combining the idea of feminism being a massive shit test to guys and a scam to win money and prizes from society just because you have a vagina one can see that the only solution is to treat it like the cult bullshit it is while that is nothing new for those of us here at return of kings  and nothing new for those our message reaches the reason we must treat it like that has hopefully been a little more exposed to the light here
the reason that feminism makes no sense and makes it seem like all men have no way to succeed and must lose everything is because that is precisely the point there is no way to win there is no equality there is only female superiority males that go along with it and men that do not

there are those who think we should only get our news from official sources you know like the blonde telling you what to believe in between hocking a hockey game 
if theres anything the  election showed us its that the american people are increasingly distrustful of and not listening to the commands laid out by the once mainstream media theyre increasingly reticent to commit national and demographic suicide under the guise of diversity and other nebulous ideals theyre desperate not only to drain the swamp but to restore some sense of national pride and stability to the declining usa 
in response the controllers of the presstitutes the people who really run the world are already hard at work trying to find some way to create a false narrative about fake news sites in order to lay the ground work for censorship and control the internet has all but destroyed the corporategovernment narrative and there is a shit fit happening at the highest levels of the propaganda ministry ie cnn abc cbs nbc et al because they have learned the american people know how full of shit they really are 
sites like return of kings are on the front lines of this war in support of free speech and it is vitally important we stay on top of our game to avoid a reversion to the managed propaganda the centralized control of mass media gave us over the last  years hackers and leakers play right into the hands of the censorship narrative 
make no mistake one of the reasons leakers of misdeeds done by politicians and the elite they work for have been allowed to continue leaking dirty laundry is because it plays into the hands of those with designs on censorship and regaining control of the information the sheeple get to listen to having julian assange and edward snowden doing leaks of information and giving them extensive press coverage plays right into the hands of the censorship brigade because they can also play the protecting national security game when the time to silence dissent comes  
fake news is only the first assault in what is sure to become a full scale war on free speech on the internet we can be thankful trump won the election rather than the bitch since his election will slow the process of censorship but the aggressiveness of the fake news narrative shows us how determined some people are to shut us up and shut us down 
the new york times is already on the front lines of this assault on free speech on the internet only days after the bitch lost the election publisher arthur sulzberger published a mea culpa and promised to rededicate the newspaper to honest reporting 
we cannot deliver the independent original journalism for which we are known without the loyalty of our subscribers the new york times promises to give the news impartially without fear or favor we also approach the incoming trump administration without bias 
dont buy into it this is whats known in public relations as a diversion tactic while we focus on our seeming victory theyre already moving on to their next false narrative  socalled fake news no sooner than the ink dried on the promise to give trump a chance the new york times was moving to shut up the very people who made possible his rise to power  the altright and alternative news web sites 
while some fake news is produced purposefully by teenagers in the balkans or entrepreneurs in the united states seeking to make money from advertising false information can also arise from misinformed social media posts by regular people that are seized on and spread through a hyperpartisan blogosphere 
they did a spurious case study on how a rumor got started about protesters being bussed in to protest at trump rallies never mind the mainstream media is a business that runs lock stock and barrel on fake news almost every narrative they create is a false one one need do no more than a google search to discredit many if not most of the mainstream medias stories the hypocrisy is astounding pulling the plug facebook censorship algorithms are nothing compared to the elites agenda of eliminating free speech online 
whether or not the fake news narrative gains traction the next step will be for the elite to create a problem that affects millions of people online then follow through with the hegelian dialectic with a preordained solution to make everyone safer online and to stop the spread of false information while protecting free speech online by destroying it 
look for no less than a figurative internet  if the elite become desperate enough 
theyll pull the plug on the backbone of the internet shutting down ecommerce and communication online for a few days blame it on a fake news story just like benghazi was blamed on a youtube video then spring in to save us from ourselves by passing all sorts of creative laws and restrictions aimed at nothing more than eliminating competition to the corporategovernment narrative and gutting yet another of our bill of rights protections 
make no mistake freedom of speech is the most important of amendments to the constitution once that is taken away its game over obama has already floated the idea of silencing those of us who cling to our guns and religion and continues this narrative even after the election of trump 
obama has already been floating the idea of official news web sites this is nothing more than proposing the creation of the american equivalent of pravda in the soviet union in which only the stateapproved newspaper was considered the truth and everything else was considered lies obviously the new world order socialist narrative would be the only truth under a system such as this and traditional and conservative views would be relentlessly silenced 
check out what the messiah said in berlin recently 
in an age where theres so much active misinformation and its packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a facebook page or you turn on your television where some overzealousness on the part of a us official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made then we wont know what to protect if we cant discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda then we have problems 
the fact he is saying these things should frighten you it should also make you angry this statement is a pc way of saying the goal of the power structure is to shut us the fuck up they want us to listen to clueless journalists who encourage the idea of microchipping your children and later yourselves so every aspect of your life can be controlled by the government 
we must fight back by discrediting the fake news narrative at every turn and informing those who will listen of the possibility of a fake internet  designed to give the government a reason to curb free expression on the very libertarian internet of today",2016-11-08
550,things to know about prague czech republic,"what motivates you to live what is the meaning of life
for centuries mankind has questioned everything mankinds quest for the answer to what drives us and what pushes us forward in times of darkness is not exempt from analysis in fact its been a consistent theme since the dawn of time stoicism  although not directly attributed to answering what drives us skirts around the topic and creates a general set of principles to help us deal with negative externalities in life
while many philosophers have pontificated on the subject of mankinds driving force and the will to live theres a problem inherent with such an analysis in order to research such a basic and instinctual topic one needs to experience a visceral cerebral experience that brings him or her to a basic instinctual level before having such an epiphany one needs to examine our animalistic base and then explore logically from there
one such analysis is known as logotherapy from the greek word logoswise  logotherapy developed by viktor frankl is an influential school of psychotherapy that is founded on the pillars of what motivates mankind before we delve into logotherapy however its important that we discuss viktor franklwho he was and why his unique perspective provides for an incredibly powerful source of credibility and authority

viktor frankl was born in  in what was at that time known as austriahungary frankl was a neurologist and psychiatrist his early life was relatively unspectacular but from an early age he displayed an interest in philosophy as well as psychotherapy initially interested in freud and adlers work he began to see their faults and eventually diverged from their teachingsbecoming particularly interested in depression as well as suicide
during  frankl in completing his residency in neurology was responsible for setting up the selbstmörderpavillon  translated in english to the suicide pavilion its estimated that frankl along with his staff treated upwards of  women who had suicidal tendencies
in september of  his life was shaken frankl along with his wife and family were deported to a nazi concentration camp known as theresienstadt ghetto whilst there and during his stay at auschwitz frankl worked as a doctor in the psychiatric care unit focusing on mental health helping newcomers deal with shock and grief

in  after three years in a concentration camp frankl released his book entitled mans search for meaning  which details his experiences as a holocaust survivor as well as his theory which became known as logotherapy the book is divided into two partspart one is a detailed account of his experiences whereas part two discusses logotherapy
his time in the numerous concentration camps began to shape his philosophical and psychiatric theory while he had read books on the subject of psychological healing prior to his imprisonment he had never experienced it to the degree in which he had become accustomed to particularly intrigued as to why some prisoners lived longer than others frankl began to organize his thoughts and document how the average prisoners life in a concentration camp was reflected in their mind as a doctor focusing on grief and shockstricken inmates he was in a very unique position
hundreds and during some weeks thousands of helpless inmates were carted in auschwitz the mostfeared concentration camp weekly between the inmates sleeping next to him and those seeking treatment frankl noted that each prisoner without exception faced three stages of psychological reactions once entering the concentration camp these stages were shock apathy and depersonalization
while seemingly unimportant the noted documentation of these stages was very important for frankl as he began to notice while every inmate experienced these stages some experienced them to a less cerebral degree some inmates seemed less depressive than others and featured a happier disposition these inmateswith some expected variabilityoutlived the other inmates
discovery as he began to poke and prod frankl noticed something that separated these individuals from others hope there is never not meaning in life every moment no matter how painful dehumanizing or horrendous it is has meaning by extension frankl suggests even suffering is meaningful the inmates that survived the longestthe ones that outlived the rest had hope frankl suggested that he could tell whether or not an inmate would live just by looking at their facesthe face of a dejected depressed inmate was obvious and clear as day without hope they were doomed
everything can be taken from a man but one thing the last of the human freedomsto choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances to choose ones own way
the next question that frankl sought to answer was an important one and the foundational maxim of logotherapywhy did some men have hope and others not
the answer was love
the truth  that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire then i grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart the salvation of man is through love and in love i understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss be it only for a brief moment in the contemplation of his beloved
frankl in his book mans search for meaning recounted several instances where he would be driven into brief stints of depression after a beating during a latenight march in bare feet or watching his friend get treated inhumanely hed vacillate from depression by thinking and longing for his wife the men whom lasted the longest invariably had a wife or a job that they loved it was this motivator the unquantifiable love that pushed men in inhuman circumstances to existentially escape the physical realm and put mind above body
what we can get from this to answer this frankl codified three ways that he discovered is how we can find meaning in life  a job love and how we react to suffering its important to realize that while its easy to read this and assume that frankl is saying we should all suffer in order to find meaninghes not he is suggesting however that should we not have a jobdeed or love that allow us to find meaning in life we can still find meaning by choosing how to react in a negative situationour mental freedom is one of the only things that can never be taken from us theoretically speaking
the average man will never be faced with such a dire circumstance such as the atrocities that frankl and so many others dealt with what we can do however is choose how we react to lifes adversities
a fair assessment of logotherapy is that it provides a simplistic solution to a complex question life since life is such a complex series of events logotherapy offers a solution that may not be representative of lifes true hardships and intricacies in saying this my own personal evaluation is that this criticism in itself may have flaws by assuming that a complex question must have a complex solution even the assumption that life in complex can be debated its a cliched saying that life is hard or complexand even if it is its not out of the realm of possibility that a complex question has a simple solution  sometimes the answer we seek is right in front of us
viktor frankl died in september  and his works are still read today several logotherapy institutes exist today named after him

551,if you dress like an attention whore at work expect to be treated like one,"what would you do if you saw two boys of  years wrestling their shirts off red and sweaty they have a large group of peers around them cheering eyes wide and knuckles white would you stop them or give the young scraps some advice do you see a violent squabble or boys acting on natural impulses which will better equip them to defend their family and neighbours later in life the answer you give is in large part dependent on your gender so the fact that this scenario would make an increasingly large number of men upset is a sign of a collapsing civilization but nil desperandum  western civilization has the solution
mere horseplay
as an early years professional i saw education academics acknowledging the databoys need rough and tumble play for their mental and physical wellbeing but they have no way of encouraging this in institutions where boys are immediately reprimanded for making fingerpistols at each other without saying it directly they thought that the majority female teaching staff for younger age ranges were pushing our boys natural urge to fight like lioncubs underground whats more the boys were made to feel bad about themselves and their very nature
their solution they suggested that more men be encouraged to teach younger children and engage in rough play with them until the late s education was male dominated and boys spent a lot of time with male mentors but of course there has been no effort to bring back that environment instead a compromise between boys being boys and boys being fairy princesses was achievedplaying superheroes
as though female teachers are going to tone down the disapproval as the boys shoot lasers and magic at each other the treacherous political class present only feeble attempts to manage the symptoms of our societal masculinity problem like sticking some tape over the burst pipe of our hemorrhaging testosterone as cultural marxism continues to swing the pickaxe of nthwave feminism at it so its high time we took a few swings back
but first we need to teach our lads how to fight at the age of  or  viking children were taught the martial art of glima this was not just father and son playfighting boys and occasionally girls already wrestle with friends and family up to that age this was more systematic a group activity
the greeks also taught their boys how to wrestle because our other ancestors could see the big picture the hoplites for example were individualistic free men of all ages who voluntarily came together to practise combat this not only strengthened their communities but also allowed these farmers to fend off the persian empire yet today even isolated expressions of violence in computer games are questioned by sjws nevertheless all the signs are thereour boys are yearning for the same activities practised by their forefathers

at college i started a unofficial fight clubmen only this based in large part on the book and movie of the same name in which the narrators nietzschean alter ego tyler durden describes the bubbling frustration inside the everincreasing number of somethings coming together for underground fights were a generation of men raised by women naturally half the guys in my year were participating within a week but our young boys should be taught how to fight openly and without shame to avoid hidden expressions of violence and maybe even some massshootings by angry loner teens when they are young it is the perfect time to teach them
young lads have no intention of seriously injurying their friends its just good fun and produces healthier attitudes towards violence and confidence in selfdefence and the defence of ones community furthermore a recent study has shown that fighting helps to strengthen peer relationships meaning less bullying and segregation it is interesting to compare the codes of honour of ancient greek wrestling etc with those we intuit as wrestling children
no intentional hitting or kicking no gouging the eyes or biting no going for the balls thats precisely how i used to wrestle with my brothers and friends as a pup it was just obvious if someone took things too far they were ostracised from the fun at least until they calmed down and apologised if someone got hurt we stopped checked whether they were just being a pussy or needed to get themselves mended we kept calm and carried on
were a generation of men raised by women  tyler durden
the data are screaming that men havent changed especially our need to practise fighting we still have the same natural impulses but their suppression no their demonisation has made our men weak and submissive so much so many are selfdeprecating betas who believe masculinity is toxic full of white guilt and ashamed of western civilization we have everything to be proud of and need to encourage our boys fighting spirit so they grow some balls some confidence in themselves and their kin thats the spirit which has kept our enemies foreign and domestic at bay for thousands of years and will do the same to cultural marxism malevolent immigrants and anyone else who wants to have a go if we want to turn scrapping boys into men first and gentlemen second we need to organise some fights not break them up

552,election result discussion for the  presidential election open thread,"earlier i skewered nine dictators thugs demagogues and politicians adored by leftists despite considerable failings in policy ethics and hygiene here are six more overhyped figures revered by leftists who always get everything wrong
franklin delano roosevelt 
how the world remembers fdr led america through the great depression and wwii remembered fondly by seniors who heard his inspiring fireside chats
the ugly truth some economists argue that fdrs measures prolonged the great depression  all the new deal programs were struck down as unconstitutional except social security he got the supreme court to back off by threatening to pack the court with more members with views to his liking that restrained their judicial opinion though the constitution doesnt grant congress the power to create a federal retirement system
social security worksthough its slim pickings if its a retirees only incomeand for decades the surplus has been a cash cow offsetting congressional overspending  however the aging baby boomers who didnt have enough children might turn the cash cow into an albatross further the social security number is now a defacto universal id number a convenient database field for monitoring citizens  americas founding fathers would have been appalled at todays domestic spying  and the soviet dictators of old would have wept with envy
fdr pledged to keep the usa out of wwii  meanwhile he quietly did everything possible to antagonize japan a oncefriendly nation such as among several items freezing their assets and cutting off their oil supply when he got intelligence of the upcoming attack on pearl harbor he didnt order the base to be locked and loaded
if that wasnt bad enough so nearly a quarter million americans died in battle but at least the pivotal intervention came just in time to make the world safe for democracy right unfortunately fdr was far too friendly with the ussr giving them nearly  billion in food weaponry and other supplies about  billion adjusted for inflation
at the yalta conference fdr agreed to let uncle joe stalin take over eastern europe general patton wanted to press forward at full speed to keep as much territory as possible away from soviet tyranny but politics hampered him every step of the way until he got rubbed out  when the iron curtain rose and the cold war began winston churchill said we slaughtered the wrong pig if only roosevelt had listened to his generals
fdr wasnt a communist but many of his appointees and trusted advisers were later joseph mccarthy barely scratched the surface trying to get rid of them
walter cronkite 
how the world remembers he was a longtime cbs anchorman reporting many triumphs and tragedies a friendly face on living room tvs for decades he became everyones uncle walter according to polls he was the most trusted man in america
the ugly truth although a decent fellow in person cronkite was the archetypal bigname liberal journalist  spinning the news for decades sometimes it was rather subliminal including his signature subtle sneer most of the public then believed journalists were muckrakers and unbiased truthtellers as cronkites tagline went and thats the way it is
until cronkites late career the mainstream media had a veneer of respectabilityperhaps like warped plastic barely sticking to crumbling particleboard but a veneer nonetheless there once were only three american corporate tv networks from manhattan they were the publics information gatekeepers no other broadcast news besides shortwave radio was available baby boomer liberals might get a bit mistyeyed remembering those days today six megaconglomerates own  of the media but at least the internet lets us present our own perspectives and call out biased reporters 
if that wasnt bad enough  his biggest whopper was about the tet offensive the viet cong launched a desperate allout assault suffered very heavy losses mostly it was over within a day and ultimately the vc gained no territory however the most trusted man in america gave them a propaganda victory reporting that the vietnam war was hopeless public opinion promptly turned against the war ho chi minh shouldve given cronkite a medal an honorary vc generalship and a dozen roses
many forget that the  paris accords brought peace two years later though the shaky ford administration couldnt persuade congress to respond appropriately to a shit test by north vietnam then they invaded and saigon fell all thats a long story but public opinion from biased reporting certainly didnt help that affected americas prestige abroad along with the lives of millions of south vietnamese killed or sent to reeducation camps 
allen ginsberg 
how the world remembers he was a pioneer of the beatniks much beloved by the hippies who followed and lauded with several literary prizes some even credit him with basically starting the s counterculture singlehandedly
the ugly truth ginsberg was neurotic and a degenerate he wrote a socalled poem about his sphincter yes really but the rest isnt much better anyone considering his bathroom wall ravings as profound either is educated beyond his ability to comprehend believed the hype and didnt read it or dropped too much acid
howl his bestknown poem begins i saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness a brief excerpt get some brain bleach describing these best minds
who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of capitalism
who distributed supercommunist pamphlets in union square weeping and undressing while the sirens of los alamos wailed them down and wailed down wall and the staten island ferry also wailed
who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons
who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication
who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts
who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists and screamed with joy
who blew and were blown by those human seraphim the sailors caresses of atlantic and caribbean love
who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may 
even overlooking the lunacy buggery and butthurt ginsbergs free verse is stylistically lazy back when poetry meant keats and kipling it rhymed and had meter
he was a noted critic of the usa for example
america i used to be a communist when i was a kid im not sorry
ginsberg visited several communist countries getting himself deported from some of them for immorality he abandoned his ancestral faith for buddhism and had a hare krishna phase what people believe is up to them of course but adding these two things upalong with his wretched poetryreveals a tortured soul rejecting everything one belongs to is childish rebellion for rebellions sake
granted ginsbergs popularity was greatest during the screwedup kill your parents s still what were those who promoted his crapulous drivel smoking were the literary gatekeepers pushing cultural marxism running out of talented writers
if that wasnt bad enough ginsberg joined the north american manboy love association sometimes speaking kindly on their behalf explaining in an accurately titled interviewpolitics pederasty and consciousnessto the harvard crimson 
as i get older having very specialised sexual tastes it gets harder to make out i like young boys why id have more chance at making out with younger guys if i were younger dewier dewylimbed
the media usually portrays pickup artists as reprobates and screeched about donald trumps yearsold private locker room talk but the presstitutes likewise the lefty intelligentsia fawningly praised ginsberg despite his appetite for young boys 
ted kennedy best friends forever east and west
how the world remembers he was the lion of the senate representing massachusetts from  until his death in  this champion of social justice carried on the kennedy legacyhailed as americas nobilityafter his two brothers were tragically slain
the ugly truth he was as passionate for booze and adultery as he was for social justice but the suckers kept reelecting him his lack of character sank way deeper though all the way underwater
after a night of partying on chappaquiddick island ted kennedy drove off a bridge he escaped but failed to help his passenger mary jo kopechne per one of the investigators she suffocated slowly in an air pocket for about two hours if hed ran to a nearby house for helprather than waiting nine hours to sober upshe wouldve survived he got a two month suspended sentence barely a slap on the wrist for vehicular manslaughter the judge basically said poor teddy had suffered enough what about how miss kopechne suffered theres one set of rules for the elites  and another for us shortly thereafter he tried to spindoctor it with a woe is me shtick the suckers kept reelecting him though a presidential bid was now beyond reach
as for his many legislative actions the immigration and nationality act of  was the most notorious he promised the public 
first our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually under the proposed bill the present level of immigration remains substantially the same secondly the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset contrary to the charges in some quarters the bill will not inundate america with immigrants from any one country or area or the most populated and deprived nations of africa and asia in the final analysis the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think the bill will not flood our cities with immigrants it will not upset the ethnic mix of our society it will not relax the standards of admission it will not cause american workers to lose their jobs 
the lion of the senate was lyin his fat ass off this population replacement policy threatens americas future  just as the coudenhovekalergi plan is doing in europe still the suckers kept reelecting him
if that wasnt bad enough besides giving away the country to which the constitution granted the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity  lyin ted was in cahoots with the kgb  he proposed to help his soviet pal yuri andropov with tidying up the ussrs image problem during the cold wars endgame the damning documents suggested that walter cronkite see above and barbara walters might be used for this effort conservatives often suspect liberals are soft on communism little did they know how cozy ted kennedy was in bed with comrade andropov
john lennon 
how the world remembers he was a talented musician arguably the most prominent of the beatles their story was an archetypal garage band becoming a bar band and eventually breaking out into great fame lennon produced dozens of hits that still get air play hes remembered as a wonderful man an embodiment of the s the good parts  anyway and the conscience of the world
the ugly truth despite lennons considerable talents not all his songs were excellent things slipped with the white album  revolution  really after the beatles broke up he started a solo career often featuring songs with sophomoric political poses his last album produced during his lifeafter dragging himself out of a long heroin stuporwas double fantasy  critics at first agreed that it sucked after a nut shot lennon they felt sorry for him and declared it brilliant
lennon was the archetypal leftist celebrity using fame to push politics granted everyone has a right to their opinion but being able to sing or act confers no special political expertise his song imagine is particularly telling as he put it
imagine that there was no more religion no more country no more politics is virtually the communist manifesto even though im not particularly a communist and i do not belong to any movement
being under the shadow of the berlin wall back in their bar gig days shouldve precluded sophomoric posturing like this
if that wasnt bad enough his failings are quite troubling too numerous to fully detail one item is abandoning his family the way his own father did a truly wonderful man wouldnt do that
another item was his extensive substance abuse he spent  guzzling booze his lost weekend one night a waitress refused service because he stuck a menstrual pad on his head then
lennon do you know who i am
waitress yeah youre some asshole with a kotex on his forehead
one lennon biographer asked timothy leary whod been on hundreds of acid trips what lennons extreme lsd consumption would do leary had no idea finally what kind of inner vacuum caused this highly successful musician much beloved by the public to get himself strung out on heroin
jimmy carter in this heartwarming scene jimmy carter and uncle fidel stand for the cuban national anthem in havana
how the world remembers carter is praised as a rare honest politician exemplifying christian principles and tolerance
the ugly truth the economy tanked during the carter administration doubledigit inflation and high unemployment economists are still puzzled by stagflation normally unemployment and inflation are inversely correlated at least obama gave economists another data point to study
carters commendably not corrupt but exemplified bleedinghearted liberalism despite winning the nobel peace prize for not being george w bush likewise al gore and the lightworker carter was a lackluster embarrassment he was known for tmi statements for example about his hemorrhoids and committing adultery in his heart at least clinton had the balls to do it for real he ranked lower than mr whipple on a face recognition survey the boston globe reported on one of his speeches with the headline more mush from the wimp finally journalists got something right
carters shining foreign policy moment was the camp david accords establishing peace between egypt and israel america started giving over a billion annually to each party for making peace which ironically supplies their military why the usa wasnt even a combatant aside from the uss liberty incident which certainly shouldnt inspire american tribute money taxpayers still fund this absurd protection racket
worse he badly bungled the iran hostage crisis one iranian official later stated they wouldve released the hostages if the usa had threatened force in the beginning yep carter failed irans shit test consequentially the usa lost tons of international prestige and the ordeal of the hostages dragged on unnecessarily
if that wasnt bad enough carter is often a little too cordial with notorious dictators  worse clinton trusted him to represent the usa during disarmament talks with north korea they gave him the potemkin village show he bought it hook line and sinker yet again carter was played for a chumpthe usa opened its wallet and gave north korea aid and they pinkyswore to stop their nuclear program now the norks have nukessurprise awesome job mister nice guy

bill still  good morning im still reporting on chan 
if truepundit is right again then there are movements of fbi agents tonight that suggest a massive raid happening tomorrow in the dc metro area that may involve arrests and seizure of evidence in the clinton foundation investigation 
i think i can hear the sound of thousands of computers being scrubbed by bleachbit from leesburg virginia to bowie maryland when i walk outside and if so then tomorrow a mighty blow for freedom will be struck as the first step towards the restoration of the rule of law is taken 
but first this letter from anonymous writing on chan making some interesting predictions 
first of all what is chan 
see also sr   huma abedin flipped in nypd slimy sex probe  crooked hillary may be involved 
it is a message board that is designed from the ground up to be totally anonymous users dont even have to pick a username posts are time sensitive  less time for rrated discussion threads  more time for g or pg rated ones so the reliability of the comments can only be judged by knowledge of the context surrounding the comments 
i did a story on chan on aug   still report   since i thought it was true i ran the story then now it no longer seems a bit flaky because much of it has panned out 
the particular chan thread that pertained to whether or not hillary clinton would not be recommended for indictment by fbi director jim comey was announced by an anonymous fbi analyst 
now management of the thread has apparently been taken over by anonymous the previous author may have met his fate at the hands of the conspirators attempting to steal the american election what follows is the message dated nov    
over the next few days many new documents will be released the contents of these documents will contain evidence of perhaps the largest coverup in american history 
before this happens we would like to explain ourselves and answer a few questions you may have 
until this month wikileaks and anonymous have worked together building an efficient detailed comprehensive set of documents that would be responsible for the incarceration of hillary clinton bill clinton and  individuals ranging from the dnc fbi cia and clinton foundation 
these documents will show without a doubt the evidence of treason obstruction of justice election fraud manipulation and bribery 
this was intended to be the october surprise but before the release of these documents we were contacted by a member of the fbi as well as another from the cia and a week later by the nypd all with information pertaining to something much darker than even we imagine due to the nature of these leaks we all work together as efficiently as possible to ensure two objectives  that all necessary information would be given to the public in an organized searchable manageable way  those who provided us with this information would be able to find safety before these releases were made this concern wasnt without warrant 
the new leaks being released this week will provide documents in the form of emails pictures and videos within these will be evidence of bill clinton as well as at least six other government officials taking part in sexual acts with minors as well as evidence of human trafficking that also included minors we believe these pictures and videos were taken for the purpose of political manipulation in order to make sure all participants followed through on a previously agreed agenda 
these documents were given to us by an american government official when he had come to learn that this crime had been covered up by hillary and her staff through methods including bribery and blackmail he also told us that due to the restricted access of these documents they would soon know he was the one who released them to us we were trying to make arrangements for him to exit the country safely but he was killed before those arrangements could be carried out

554,wall street hollywood the media and sjws fail to stop donald trump from becoming americas th president,"leave a reply maureen moss  not a typical newsletter from me these are words that flowed forth this morning 
clearly the week ahead for the united states and those across the world will be one of the most significant in history the presidential election is historic in and of itself though the weeks to follow may prove to be more so nothing is as it appears to be 
we are in the beginning times of an entirely new civilization as was humanity some  years ago everything not harmonized with this new civilization will be dismantled not sometime in the future in the weeks directly in front of us 
hundreds of thousands of years and billions of people will be shaped by who we become individually and then collectively and how this earth is restructured by the events unfolding now 
we must trust we are being brought into harmony under the impulse of one system of operation 
long knowing that a new humanity and new global reality would be born in this our lifetime certainly we had little idea of how that would occur 
not all that long ago we came to know the responsibility we personally held to lift and stabilize our consciousness open wide our hearts and free ourselves from the captivity of a deceptive fearful lower nature having multiple realities 
certainly we started becoming aware of our desire to know ourselves authentically thus beginning the journey to return to a singular loving nature no longer conflicted by dual pillars of truth nor at odds or war with ourselves 
all this in divine right time and in preparation for a new reality to be born on earth it had to begin within ourselves 
certainly not as instinctively was how an entire distorted external reality politically socially economically and more operating in reverse truth riddled with deception lies and manipulation would come to find its true nature 
few would have considered how much could potentially come to light under the glare of so much darkness or that it would come through a presidential election far from over on election day regardless of the seeming winnerin the united states of america 
this election is a seismic evolutionary event  
in this week ahead and those to follow through the flurry and activity of the end times and the beginnings as you witness the distorted psychology of the human system exposed and broken down from every angle breathe stay in your center and with an open heart open mind and love be in observance of this most profound display of activity on behalf of humanities evolution and that of the earth 
hold each other close and stay in your center  we will get through thisit has already been written

555,what to do in an ammo panic,"leave a reply 
steve taylor phd  from the standpoint of ordinary consciousness separateness seems to be a basic part of the human condition most human beings experience themselves as egos trapped inside their own mindspace observing a world which seems to be out there on the other side of their skulls as a result the normal human state is one of aloneness were always onlookers rather than participants we can communicate with other people by speaking writing or gesturing but they will never be able to truly know us or to share our thoughts and feelings our inner being will always be sealed off from them 
egoseparation also creates a sense of incompleteness because were separate from the world were like fragments which have broken off from the whole and so feel a sense of insufficiency there s a kind of hole inside us which we spend most of our lives trying to fill but very rarely manage to like cats who were taken away from their mother at birth and who are always hankering for affection and attention to try to compensate for a sense of lack bornagain christians mean something close to this when they say that there is a godshaped hole inside us although in my view traditional religion cant fill the hole either only provide the same ultimately incomplete consolation as wealth or success 
as a result of this aloneness and incompleteness we dont feel completely at home in the world were not completely rooted here and so feel somehow adrift as if we dont fully belong like people who have travelled around the world so much that they no longer feel at home anywhere whereas traditional indigenous peoples seem to perceive the world as a benign and benevolent place to us it seems indifferent and even vaguely malevolent 
in addition our egoisolation generates a basic sense of insecurity and insignificance our own ego is so tiny and so flimsy in the face of the enormous world out there  like a tiny wooden beach shack at the edge of a vast ocean we feel dwarfed by the sheer weight of the phenomena and events taking place out there  how can we possibly have any significance in relation to them how can this fragile entity inside our heads stand up to the might of the world the wider effects of separateness 
however the effects of this separateness reach far beyond the individual in fact i would go so far as to say that the sense of separateness is the root cause of the constant conflict warfare and oppression which have blighted human history the human sense of incompleteness generates a craving for possessions power and status as a way of trying to complete ourselves and compensate for our inner discord we try to complete ourselves  and make ourselves significant  by gaining power over other people or by collecting wealth and possessions 
this desire for wealth and power is the root cause of warfare and oppression too coupled with the reduced empathy which separateness causes the separate self walls us off from other human beings makes it difficult for us to feel with them and to experience the world from their perspective this makes it possible for us to be violent and cruel to other people since we cant sense the suffering we cause them so we oppress and exploit them in the service of our own desires oppress women members of lower classes or castes different races so that we can gain more power status and wealth 
the sense of separateness is also the root cause of our abuse of the environment it means that we experience a sense of otherness to nature and that we cant sense its aliveness and as a result we dont feel any qualms about exploiting and abusing it why separateness 
i wouldnt exactly say that separateness is an illusion as many nonduality teachers would not an illusion but an aberration  something which exists but shouldnt children dont experience separateness they exist in a state of natural relatedness to the world this is one of the reasons why childhood is so wonderful because the child feels connected to everything around them in a participatory flow with all experience with no in here or out there 
there are also many other peoples in the world who even as adults dont exist in a state of separateness most of the world s indigenous peoples dont see themselves as separate to their environment they feel a strong sense of connection to nature an awareness that they are a part of the web of creation and one which is no more important than any other 
as tim ingold writes of the batek negritos of malaysia for example they see themselves as involved in an intimate relationship of interdependence with the plants animals and hala spirits including the deities which inhabit their world or as the cherokee indian scholar rebecca adamson points out for indigenous peoples the environment is perceived as a sensate conscious entity suffused with spiritual powers through which the human understanding is only realised in perfect humility before the sacred whole the hopi use the term novoitti for the concept of living in harmony with nature while the tlingit also of north america call it shogan 
the anthropologist lucien levybruhl believed that essential characteristic of native peoples was that the limits of their individuality are variable and illdefined he noted that rather than existing as selfsufficient individual entities indigenous peoples sense of identity was bound up with their community and their land he cites reports of native peoples who used the word i when speaking of their group and others who see their land as an extension of their self so that being forced away from their land would be tantamount to death this is why native peoples are often prepared to commit suicide rather than leave their lands 
the naming practices of certain peoples suggest this too for us a name is a permanent label which defines our individuality and autonomy but australian aborigines for example do not have fixed names which they keep throughout their lives their names regularly change and include those of other members of their tribe other native peoples use tekonyms terms which describe the relationship between two people instead of personal or kinship names 
the sense of separateness seems to be a quirk of our psychological development for us it slowly develops as we move into adolescence becoming firmly established in our late teens the ego develops as a structure creating a sense of innerness and walling us off 
witness the massive change which occurs when a child enters adolescence especially with boys the freshness and joy of childhood gives way to dullness and confusion after being a part of the glorious flow of experience were suddenly outside the world alone inside our own mental space this is why adolescents have such a strong need for belonging 
their new sense of separation makes them feel so vulnerable that they need to reinforce their identity by being a part of groups or gangs or by following fashions more bleakly this is also why most murders are committed by young men in response to perceived slights or insults with their new fragile sense of identity young men are liable to take offence at any kind of trivial affront making them feel belittled and creating an instant desire to take revenge and regain their lost status 
i remember this transition clearly from my own adolescence after a carefree childhood i suddenly felt locked inside myself alone with thoughts and feelings which no one else would ever be able to experience along with that i felt an acute selfconsciousness i was aware of every movement i made and every word i spoke so that i couldnt do anything naturally anymore i felt exposed when i walked down the street aware that people could have been looking at me from their windows 
as they grow into adulthood most people deal with the fragility and vulnerability of the self by taking on roles and attachments they take on the roles of their jobs attach themselves to certain beliefs strengthening their identity with labels such as socialists atheists or muslims or attach themselves to ambitions to knowledge theyve accumulated to their selfimage as important or powerful people or emotionally attach themselves to other people these roles and attachments become the scaffolding of the ego propping it up and at the same time they reinforce separation making the individual walled off awakening from the sleep of separateness 
however no matter how far into separateness we fall in a sense its never more than superficial no matter how strong the ego becomes its never more than a construct everyone experiences moments when separateness temporarily fades and we become part of the unity again these are what i refer to as awakening experiences they frequently occur when were walking amongst natural surroundings when were dancing or running during or after sex listening to or playing music in these situations the normal chattering of the ego which is the normal fuel of the ego maintaining it as a structure becomes quiet leading to a softening of its boundaries separateness dissolves and were afloat on the ocean of being again immersed in the glorious isness and aliveness of the world 
tellingly in these moments there is always an identity shift we feel that weve become someone else a deeper more grounded self which seems more authentically you the egoself we identified with before seems like an imposter a limited and shallow trickster who somehow deluded us into thinking it was our identity 
there are also many cases of extreme loss or intense turmoil when all of the egos building blocks its roles and attachments are broken away a person might be diagnosed with cancer and told they only have a few months left to live an alcoholic might reach rock bottom and be on the point of suicide a person might become seriously disabled through injury or illness or they might suffer from the trauma of bereavement depression the destruction of hopes and beliefs and so on in most cases these forms of loss simply bring sadness and suffering but for a minority of individuals they can trigger a spiritual awakening with all its scaffolding broken down the normal egoself dissolves away and our deeper truer self emerges in its place like a butterfly from a caterpillar the person feels reborn like a different person inhabiting the same body with a new sense of meaning and connection 
in all of these experiences there is a sense of coming home back to our original oneness the harmony which both as an individual and as a species we fell away from it was always there it is always here its just that our separate selves deluded us into thinking we were asleep

558,what the  election has exposed," reply 
according to numerous reports and stories that have been published through the years among the many alleged secrets the vatican has there is a device called the chronovisor the device enables its user to observe future as well as past events many believe this device is one of the greatest guarded secrets humanity has ever had 
some even believe it is a crucial tool which has allowed the vatican to preserve its influence and power through the years 
ever since h g wells composed his novel the time machine many people have been left fascinated by the idea of time travel even theoretical physics dreams of the possibility of making it work one day everything related to time travel today is related to science fiction or so it seems at least interestingly on may   an italian newspaper shocked the world when they published an article with a provoking headline a machine that photographs the past has finally been invented  
the news article indicated that dozens of scientists created an artifact that allowed them to photograph the past and even witness important historical accounts directly connected with jesus christ 
the alleged device which according to many is nothing more than science fiction was built in the s by a team of scientists led by father pellegrino maria ernetti an italian physicist who eventually became a priest 
it is believed that the team received important help from nobel laureate enrico fermi and famous rocket scientist wernher von braun 
the chronovisor is a relatively small object that is equipped with a number of antennas and is composed entirely of precious alloys cathode tubes some dials and levers reports by father ernetti suggest that whoever uses the device is able to capture and record specific locations important events and follow in history noteworthy individuals according to father ernetti he had observed among other historical events christs crucifixion and photographed it as well view image the image to the left is the one obtained using the chronovisor on the right is a similar image located in a church in perugia 
it is even said that under the perfect conditions the device offers its user the ability to foresee what was going to happen in the near future 
however father ernetti remained secretive and stated he was not at liberty to reveal further details about the chronovisor 
father ernetti did however reveal that the chronovisor worked by processing residual electromagnetic radiation left over by numerous processes 
according to numerous reports father ernetti used the chronovisor to witness important historical events with the most notable being the crucifixion of christ 
however father ernetti revealed that thanks to this invention had managed to witness the destruction of sodom and gomorrah and other major historical events such as the founding of rome in  bc also thanks to the chronovisor father ernetti was able to recompose the missing work thyestes  written by ennio quinto and represented in rome in  ac in its original version and the original text of the the two stone tablets written by god exodus  which were given to moses on mount sinai apart from witnessing the likes of napoleon roman philosopher cicero and other great and momentous historical and biblical episodes 
french priest françois charles antoine brune was one of the first to hear about the chronovisor according to father françois he met father ernetti in the s when the two were traveling across the grand canal of venice as the two were experts in ancient languages they began to talk about the bible and its interpretation through the years supposedly these are the blueprints of the chronoviso r image 
father brune that was very intrigued when the father ernetti revealed that there was a machine that could answer all questions related to the bible 
when father françois asked about the machine father ernetti described the chronovisor saying that it was device that functioned just like a tv but instead of receiving transmissions from local stations the chronovisor was able to tune into the past and allow the viewer to see and hear events that had occurred centuries before 
ernetti told brune that the machine worked by detecting images and sounds that humanity had created which were floating in space 
it is said that this intriguing device and the project behind it were canceled by the vatican but not destroyed some believe the chronovisor is located somewhere in the vatican hidden in one of the many chambers hidden away from society 
however there are other versions that suggest that father ernetti and his team decided to voluntarily dismantle the device because since it could tune anywhere and anytime in the past if it were to fall into the wrong hands it could create the scariest dictatorship the world has ever seen 
interestingly before father ernetti died in april  he wrote a letter in which he insisted that the device was real and was not a hoax as many believed 
father ernetti claimed that the alleged photograph the chronovisor had captured of jesus christ on the cross showing the sorrowful face of a bearded man gazing towards the heavens was real even though some critics argue that the image was a reproduction of a statue of jesus located in a church in perugia 
critics also claim that the alleged text the device managed to observe of thyestes included latin words that did not exist at the time it was made 
in  father ernetti also said that pope pius xii forbade us to do disclose any details about this device because the machine was very dangerous it can restrain the freedom of man 
however in  the vatican issued a decree in which it warned that anyone using an instrument of such characteristics would be excommunicated according to many this was an unnecessary warning since according to them the chronovisor never existed so why issue a warning if it was just another hoax 
what do you think about the story behind the chronovisor do you think it is another top secret object kept away from society by the vatican sf source rise earth",2016-11-10

560,what donald trumps victory means for men,leave a reply aa michael  when you are attuned to the midthdimensional frequencies of light you relinquish the idea of being human as you have known it in the past it is a time of the emergence of your soul consciousness as you allow it to become the reigning influence within your life this means you begin to listen to the wisdom of your body elemental and the signals it sends as to what is appropriate for your physical and emotional wellbeing your dna and the cells of your body begin to integrate the higher frequencies of light and gradually you begin to vibrate and attune to the refined energy of the new age this period of the transformation process could be likened to a death of your old selfconsciousness which is really the process of removing the veils of illusion as you integrate each new level of your oversoulhigher self you absorb the wisdom and illumination of that facet of your vaster being you are in the process of shedding the multiple layers of density which you have absorbed within your auric field down through the many ages of earthly experience the saying the light shall set you free is a true statement for the light is dissolving the layers upon layers of negativity that you have carried for such a very long time you begin to function within an auric field of refined light of your own creation as you turn inward and learn to stay focused and centered within your sacred heart in the power of the now moment over time you as light transformers begin to draw forth and integrate the maximum amount of adamantine particles of creator light and you then consciously radiate forth the remainder out to humanity and to the world when you achieve a certain level of harmony within you open the physical body gateways or portals to the higher dimensions the ascension chakra or the medulla oblongata and the vagus nerve at the base of the skull and also the back portal of your sacred heart and your sacred mind these are major steps in the ascension process when this process is complete you are well on your way to gaining access to the first sublevel of the fifth dimension where your entrylevel sacred triad is waiting to welcome you the adameve kadmon body is your original individualized seed atom godself in a fully conscious light body form created by the elohim lords of lightbuilders of as

to take on any form necessary to create and experience all forms of creation in your fathermother gods plan for this universe the adameve kadmon is a spiritualphysical creation which incarnates in the planetary worlds during all cycles of divine creation physical body  in the beginning awakening process there is a desire to turn inward and to listen to the inner wisdom of the soul this soul awareness includes your body elemental the memory seed atom which contains the perfect blueprint for your original adameve kadmon light form emotional body  first you become aware that your emotions control you through your wants needs and desires which in the long run do not bring you a sense of happiness or satisfaction you begin to turn inward and to question your life choices asking awhat have been the results of your actions you begin to seek answers for the pain and dissatisfaction in your life the voice of your superconscious mind becomes stronger as you gradually take heed and follow your souls guidance as you become comfortable and begin to rely on this voice of higher wisdom the egodesire body gradually relinquishes control and the soulself becomes the director and guiding influence in your life you begin to align your will with the will of your higher self for you have gradually learned to trust the inspirational and intuitive thoughts from your sacred mind eventually you begin to view all interactive events in your life from a higher vantage point you develop emotional detachment through a more refined view of human interactions having experienced most of the important tests of the emotions you develop a better understanding of the human emotional nature again you learn to go with the flow and you view your tests and challenges as gifts and opportunities for growth you have learned to make peace with the past and to script your future as you endeavor to live and focus on the now moment gradually over time the vibrational patterns of the emotional body are lifted above the magnetic pull of the physical realm the mental body  you begin to realize the limitations of your subconscious and conscious minds and you see how rigid limited and stuck you have been in the mass consciousness belief structure you willingly begin a selfanalysis process whereby you reevaluate your attitudes judgment and programmed concepts you begin to feel a

561,two more hollywood films for men that leave todays sjw movies in the dust,"leave a reply mike adams  under fbi head james comey who has deliberately and clearly conspired to cover up the enormous number of crimes committed by hillary clinton and her closest staffers the fbis investigation of additional emails is now concluded we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july with respect to secretary clinton comey announced today 
with this decision james comey essentially announces that the tyranny of criminal government in washington is now complete  
the rule of law has just been declared null and void by the head of the fbi no sufficiently powerful person in washington will ever be held accountable for their crimes including crimes of treason against the nation bribery corruption destruction of evidence and selling government influence 
unless something reverses very quickly the fbi has now cemented its position as nothing more than a corrupt branch of a totalitarian criminal regime that has seized power in washington to protect the criminal class of political elitists who rule over the nation as lawless tyrants 
now its up to rogue fbi agents or the nypd to go public with the evidence they have and expose the horrifying truth about what the clintons really are pedophilia and all if that fails my analysis says we may see a rapid ramping up of real talk of open revolt  perhaps even leading to an armed citizens march on washington to depose the criminal regime in power as ive pointed out before that effort would only require a few thousand armed citizens to achieve the occupation of key government buildings and the overthrow of the criminals in power sadly it would also involve tremendous bloodshed and loss of life lets hope it doesnt come to that 
heres the letter james comey sent out today i write to supplement my october   letter that notified you the fbi would be taking additional investigative steps with respect to former secretary of state clintons use of a personal email server since my letter the fbi investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation during that process we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from hillary clinton while she was secretary of state based on our review we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july with respect to secretary clinton i am very grateful to the professionals at the fbi for doing an extraordinary amount f highquality work in a short period of time source uk daily mail  sf source natural news",2016-11-11

564,buzz aldrin is a warning of how success can lead to depression,"arent you surprised that hillary and the presstitutes havent blamed putin for fbi director comeys reopening of the hillary email case but the presstitutes have done the next best thing for hillary they have made comey the issue not hillary
according to us senator harry reid and the presstitutes we dont need to worry about hillarys crimes after all she is only a political woman feathering her nest just as political men have done for ages why all this misogynist talk about hillary the presstitutes cry is that comeys alleged crime is far more important this womanhating republican violated the hatch act by telling congress that the investigation he said was closed is now reopened a very strange interpretation of the hatch act during an election it is ok to announce that a candidate for president is cleared but it is not ok to say that a candidate is under investigation
in july  comey violated the hatch act when he on orders from the corrupt obama attorney general announced hillary clean in so doing comey used the prestige of federal clearance of hillarys violation of national security protocols to boost her standing in the election polls
actually hillarys standing in the polls is based on the pollsters overweighting hillary supporters in the polls it is easy to produce a favorite if you overweight their supporters in the poll questions if you look at the crowds attending the two candidates public appearances it is clear that the american people prefer donald trump who is opposed to war with russia and china war with nuclear powers is the big issue of the election
hillarys problem has the ruling american oligarchy for which hillary is the total servant concerned what are they going to do about trump if he wins will his fate be the same as john f kennedy robert kennedy martin luther king george wallace time will tell or will a hotel maid appear at the last minute in the way that the oligarchy got rid of dominique strausskahn
all of the american and western feminists progressives and leftwing remnant fell for the obvious frameup of strausskahn after strausskahn was blocked from the presidency of france and resigned as director of the imf the new york authorities had to drop all charges against strausskahn but washington succeeded in removing strausskahn as a challenge to its french vassal sarkozy
this is how the american oligarchy destroys those it suspects might not serve its interests the corrupt selfserving oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities and of course through the presstitutes americans minds
the oligarchs are now hardpressed to rescue hillary as us president so lets see if the oligarchs can once again deceive the american people
while we wait lets concern ourselves with another important issue the clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the th century allowed a small handful of megacorporations to consolidate the us media in a few hands this vast increase in the power of the oligarchy was accomplished despite us antitrust law the media mergers destroyed the american tradition of a dispersed and independent media
but really what does federal law mean to the one percent nothing whatsoever the one percents power makes them immune to law hillarys crimes might cost her the election but she wont go to jail
not content with  control of the us media the oligarchy wants more concentration and more control looks like they will be getting it thanks to the corrupt us government the federal trade commission is supposed to enforce us antitrust law instead the federal agency routinely violates us antitrust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests
because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law we now have banks too big to fail unregulated internet monopoly and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media
not so long ago there was a field of economics known as antitrust phd candidates specialized in and wrote dissertations about public control of monopoly power i assume that this field of economics like the america of my youth no longer exists
in the article below rahul manchanda explains that yet again another huge media conglomerate is being swallowed and acquired by another huge media conglomerate to create another gargantuan media outlet in another consolidation of the enormous power money wealth intimidation conspiracy and control that eviscerates the us constitution and the first amendment

566,the dangers of romantic love,"zero hedge  wwwzerohedgecom   views 
citis chief political analyst tina fordham has had a busy month 
at the start of october  when trumps victory odds were in the gutter and a clinton presidency had been priced in  in a hotly debated statement she suggested that the establishment may be approaching the us presidential completely incorrectly this is an unusual juncture but we keep looking at it through the same kinds of lenses what if its all wrong because society technology opinion polling methods and everything else dont capture marginalized voters in the way they might once have 
according to fordham the us presidential race felt more like an election in a developing nation where public distrust in government is high and conspiracy theories are rife markets seem unaware how much that low trust raises the risk of an antiestablishment vote fordham has focused on the gallup world poll on public health which analyzes two decades worth of health records of trump supporters the numbers show a correlation between the increase in the number of people going through difficult times  as measured by suicide rates depression mental illness and drug addiction  and the rise in trumps popularity fordham said 
this is the kind of thing that investors just dont normally run into but it provides another useful way to think about things because income inequality is necessary but not sufficient she said there is something more subtle going on about public expectations and exhaustion and a sense of corruption elite abuse of power and lack of control 
her conclusion was troubling for clinton fans  im getting this brexity feeling and i know other investors are as well she said the thinking is i didnt expect brexit so i better assume trump is going to win that element of investor psychology is at play here 
she followed up on monday  when she predicted that the fbis friday announcement could have a meaningful impact on the presidential race and cautioned that this may not be the end of it we continue to emphasize the potential for more black swan events emerging making things more complicated for forecasters and pollsters 
today in her latest media appearance fordham has penned an oped for the ft looking at the postelection landscape and warning that  investors face political risk whoever wins in the us election  
she first analyzes if a a clinton victory will mean business as usual for america and the global order and responds  not so fast 
investors should brace themselves for the new form of advanced economy political risk what ever the outcome of the us presidential election 
first any market relief from a victory for mrs clinton over donald trump her republican opponent will almost certainly be followed by the realization that a divided congress will mean a return to gridlock and brinkmanship over the debt ceiling with little prospect for reform 
more broadly following the vote in the uk to leave the eu the rise of mr trump and according to a yougov study authoritarian populism politics in advanced economies are having what might be termed an emerging markets moment vox populi risk a concept i formulated in  after a wave of protests coups and the rise of nonmainstream political parties has become a global phenomenon 
she then notes that the economic and market implications of advanced economy political risks are more likely to become systemically significant than their emerging markets counterparts according to the international monetary funds recently published world economic outlook political risk in the advanced economies has become the biggest threat to global growth 
specifically she envisages the trump campaign 
from threats to jail opponents on corruption charges to the proliferation of conspiracy theories the trump campaign and its supporters have borrowed heavily from the em political playbook sowing doubts not only about his opponents suitability for office but also about us political institutions a majority of republicans now say they believe the election will be rigged according to data from pew research center despite the lack of any precedent in us election history for such claims 
reverting to her notion that the us election looks a lot like that of a developing nation she notes that  what links this advanced economy political risk with its em cousin is low trust in institutions and elites  political and business elites expertsand the media it is trust plus belief in the future not growth alone that immunizes the body politic against the populist virus the collapse of trust is also evident in the sheer number of outright lies the factchecking website politifact has tracked during the campaign if everything is bogus than anything goes  
there are also the market implications 
the reaction of financial markets may be the starkest illustration of this change in trend according to the brookings institution the effect of mr trumps candidacy has been to give rise to price movements suggesting that a trump victory would reduce the value of the sp  and lead to a  per cent decline in the mexican peso as well as pricing in future volatility 
however fordhams punchline has little to do with a trump victory but rather the consequences of another clinton presidency 
mr trump may be heading for defeat but the prevalence of low trust identity politics and demographic divides across the developed world suggests that he will not be the last nonmainstream candidate to come close to power  this constellation of risks will be in evidence before elections next year in germany france and the netherlands and will have a significant impact on brexit negotiations moreover a clinton presidency is highly likely to be marked by nearcontinuous investigations as well as the risk of impeachment 
if citi is right the preelection circus and endless drama and theatrics is just the beginning of what is about to be unleashed a world in which the political realities of dm and em worlds will converge the new normal in advanced economies looks a lot like the emerging markets old normal but with considerably higher stakes for the global economy we encourage you to share and republish our reports analyses breaking news and videos  click for details

569,ways the media responded with butthurt to donald trumps victory,"with the media gripped by accusatory speculation regarding the identity of the source behind the wikileaks leak of hacked podesta and dnc emails much of it focused on russia a new theory has emerged from craig murray the former british ambassador to uzbekistan who tells sputnik a russian media outlet that the source of the leaks are not russian hackers but a washington insider
the source of these emails and leaks has nothing to do with russia at all i discovered what the source was when i attended the sam adams whistleblower award in washington the source of these emails comes from within official circles in washington dc you should look to washington not to moscow 

asked about whether or not wikileaks have ever published information at the behest of moscow murray said that wikileaks has never published any material received from the russian government or from any proxy of the russian government its simply a completely untrue claim designed to divert attention from the content of the material
while blasted by washington first by republicans several years ago and most recently by democrats the wikileaks revelations have often been hailed as a champion of accountability
i think whistleblowers have become extremely important in the west because the propaganda model  as chomsky puts it  has been reinforced to the extent that people dont get any true information out of the media at all its worth saying that julian assange and wikileaks are publishers they publish what whistleblowers leak to them mr murrary told sputnik
yet whistleblowers in the us continue to be subject to lengthy prison sentences a key example is chelsea manning who was sentenced on august   to a thirty five year sentence for providing wikileaks with sensitive military and diplomatic documents highlighting among other things us military conduct in iraq murray also mentions the case of john kiriakou a former investigator of international terrorism with the cia who turned whistleblower
the people who did the torture have suffered no comeback at all adds mr murray
taking a step back and discussing the risk of geopolitical escalation between russia and the us murray told sputnik that there is no chance whatsoever that russia is going to ever attack the united states that simply isnt going to happen
just as russia is not going to attack the united kingdom there never has been a chance that russia would ever attack either of these two countries but of course the narrative is all to do with power and funneling huge amounts of american taxpayer money into the defense industry and the security industry and these people are both from the class that benefits
its an extremely dangerous game says mr murray and it feeds into a foreign policy that is completely mad
in syria  and i should say im no fan of the assad regime at all  but the idea that backing assorted groups of jihadists to tear the country apart is a better solution is crazy and its especially crazy when weve already messed up iraq afghanistan and now were doing exactly the same thing again and you can see it doesnt work it only works in terms of promoting continued instability and continued spending for the military and the security services
finally murray also believes that the public cant get clear analysis of these issues from mainstream media because they are part of the same moneypower nexus

570,the sad saga of john walker lindh rebel without a clue,"in an excerpt of a john pilger special interview julian assange says that emails released by wikileaks show that hillary clinton is intentionally misguiding voters about the degree to which us allies are supporting isis and that donald trump will not be allowed into the oval office
assange explains that the same financial interests funding isis are funding clinton he references a  email from john podesta to clinton in which we find the following
while this militaryparamilitary operation is moving forward we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of qatar and saudi arabia which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isil and other radical sunni groups in the region

i think this is the most significant email in the whole collection said assange all serious analysts know and even the us government has agreed that some saudi figures have been supporting isis and funding isis but the dodge has always been that it is some rogue princes using their oil money to do whatever they like but actually the government disapproves but that email says that it is the government of saudi arabia and the government of qatar that have been funding isis
pilger asked assange about the possibility that trump would steal the election with the help of russia as many in the democratic party claim
assange thinks that this is highly unlikely but not because he is unpopular my analysis is that trump would not be permitted to win why do i say that because he has had every establishment off his side trump does not have one establishment maybe with the exception of the evangelicals if you can call them establishment he explained
assange says that hillary is the establishment pick banks intelligence arms companies foreign money etc are all united behind hillary clinton and the media as well media owners and the journalists themselves delivered by the daily sheeple

572,ways to forge strength through challenges,"after this october surprise donald trump only has one option left expose the clinton crimes michael on television democrats are now calling for a revolution in the streets and i believe that they are quite serious by michael snyder on november th  
the surprise victory by donald trump on november th has spawned a series of violent protests and riots all over the nation as stunned leftists continue to throw the largest postelection temper tantrum in us history protesters in large cities all across america have been disrupting public transportation looting stores hurling objects at the police and burning trump in effigy there have even been shootings at antitrump rallies in seattle and in portland  hundreds of protesters have been arrested so far and organizers are promising that this is only just the beginning meanwhile large numbers of enraged leftists are physically threatening trump on twitter  and some are even calling for a violent revolution sadly i believe that they are quite serious about this 
even some big celebrity names are starting to use the word revolution in messages to their followers on twitter katy perry has ominously warned that  the revolution is coming  and comedian sarah silverman has boldly declared that  trump gets a chance to hear us or else we r them if he fails revolution in the streets  
of course other leftists are seeking less violent ways to oppose trump there is a major push to use the electoral college to block a trump presidency if that fails there are many hoping to immediately impeach trump once he takes office and other activists such as former labor secretary robert reich are calling for a new third party if their planned postelection takeover of the democratic party is not successful 
but for many on the radical left the time for patience is over the not my president movement is taking off like a rocket and one survey found that only  percent of all clinton supporters consider trumps victory to be legitimate a protest near trump tower in new york city on saturday drew approximately  people and usa today reported that the antitrump protest in portland oregon on saturday night rapidly  devolved into a riot  
it is becoming clear that these protests are not going away any time soon and some are even beginning to refer to this movement as the purple revolution  
no sooner had trump been declared the  th president of the united states sorosfunded political operations launched their activities to disrupt trump during obamas lameduck period and thereafter the swiftness of the purple revolution is reminiscent of the speed at which protesters hit the streets of kiev the ukrainian capital in two orange revolutions sponsored by soros one in  and the other ten years later in  
as the clintons were embracing purple in new york street demonstrations some violent all coordinated by the sorosfunded moveonorg and black lives matter broke out in new york los angeles chicago oakland nashville cleveland washington austin seattle philadelphia richmond st paul kansas city omaha san francisco and some  other cities across the united states 
so could we actually see a violent revolution on the streets of america 
is the radical left really so horrified by the prospect of a trump presidency that they would actually be willing to engage in a prolonged campaign of chaos violence and physical intimidation 
well the oath keepers are so concerned about what this movement could become that they have initiated an intelligence gathering operation that they are calling operation hypo  
clearly as oath keepers we cannot simply sit around and watch while the enemies of liberty work to use violence to initiate a communist revolution in our country as a result of the intelligence being provided by our operation sabot operatives we have initiated operation hypo we have allowed our personnel to burrow deep inside these protest organizations to collect information regarding tactics motivations schedules and logistics 
we had operatives at the planning meetings for the protests that occurred last evening in baltimore md and philadelphia pa  our operatives have also penetrated numerous other planning organizations in cities across the country for opsec reasons the precise list of cities we are operating in will not be publicly disclosed 
and one thing that we already know is that the radical left is hoping to organize the largest political protest in united states history in washington dc on inauguration day i will be writing about this later today on the most important news  
the election of donald trump has been the single most galvanizing event for the radical left that we have seen in decades one of the early leaders of the not my president movement is filmmaker michael moore and the following are three of his key action points which he feels must be implemented immediately  
 must quickly and decisively form an opposition movement the likes of which hasnt been seen since the s i will do my part to help lead this as im sure many others bernie elizabeth warren moveon the hiphop community dfa etc will too the core of this opposition force will be fueled by young people who as with occupy wall street and black lives matter dont tolerate bs and are relentless in their resistance to authority they have no interest in compromising with racists and misogynists  prepare to impeach trump just as the republicans were already planning to do with president hillary from day one we must organize the apparatus that will bring charges against him when he violates his oath and breaks the law  and then we must remove him from office  must commit right now to a vigorous fight including civil disobedience if necessarywhich will block any and all donald trump supreme court nominees who do not meet our approval we demand the democrats in the senate aggressively filibuster any nominees who support citizens united or who oppose the rights of women immigrants and the poor this is nonnegotiable 
but of course other liberals are still in the shock and disbelief stage as i have stated before americans were more emotionally invested in this election than they had been in any election in decades and the aftermath has not been pretty 
this has been particularly true on college campuses all over the nation according to the new york post  college administrators have been going to extraordinary lengths to soothe the deep emotional pain that many of their students are experiencing ?the university of michigan offered its traumatized students coloring books and playdoh to calm them are its students in college or kindergarten ?the university of kansas reminded its stressedout kids that therapy dogs a regular campus feature were available ?cornell university an ivy league school held a campuswide cryin with officials handing out tissues and hot chocolate ?tufts university offered its devastated students arts and crafts sessions ok not kindergarten  more like summer camp ?at campuses from elite yale to connecticut to iowa and beyond professors canceled classes andor exams  either because students asked or because instructors were too distraught to teach 
and it is also being reported that suicide hotlines are ringing off the hook all over the nation 
we have never seen anything like this ever before and i have a feeling that this not my president movement is going to absolutely dwarf the occupy wall street and black lives matter movements and considering the very high levels of anger frustration and pain that these radical leftists are feeling it is easy to see how this movement could become very violent 
many patriots conservatives and christians were hoping that donald trump could bring america together and lead us into a new era of peace and prosperity but the radical left already hates trump more than any president that has ever come before him 
it isnt going to take much to push the radical left over the edge and if that happens we could see endless chaos violence and civil unrest for the next four years",2016-11-14
573,comment on are you on pace to reach your goals by  goals for the neomasculinity movement during trumps first term,"the election of donald trump is already having an enormous impact on the economy   th  
  sent shockwaves through the us economy and the us financial system since november th the dow has hit a brand new alltime record high  the us dollar has strengthened greatly and bank stocks are way up but not all of the economic news is good news unlike stocks bonds have reacted very negatively to trumps election victory the past week has been an absolute bloodbath for bond traders and as you will see below this is going to have dramatic implications for all us consumers moving forward 
over just a two day period more than a trillion dollars was wiped out as bond yields spiked all over the globe as cnn has noted  this type of violent reaction in the bond market has only happened three other times within the past ten years 
the rate on year treasury notes has surged to  from  before the election last weeks spike in treasury rates was so big that it had only happened three times before in the last decade 
blackrocks russ koesterich called it a violent reaction 
the move stands to have broad repercussions for all americans not only will the us government have to pay more to borrow money but mortgage rates and car loan costs should also rise thats because treasuries are used as the benchmark for many other forms of credit 
as interest rates rise virtually everyone in our society is going to feel the pain 
those that need an auto loan in order to purchase a vehicle are going to find that loan payments are significantly higher than they were before 
credit card rates will also go up and those just getting out of school will discover that their student loan payments are even more suffocating 
but the biggest impact will be felt in the housing market the average rate on a year fixed mortgage just hit the psychologicallyimportant  percent barrier and that could mean big trouble for the housing market in   
the average contract rate on the popular year fixed mortgage hit  percent according to mortgage news daily a level most didnt expect to see until the middle of next year rates have now moved nearly a half a percentage point higher since donald trump was elected president 
the situation on the ground is panicked damage control said matthew graham chief operating officer of mortgage news daily people were trying to lock loans quickly last week and are now facing a tough choice to lock today or hope for a bounce many hoped for a bounce last week heading into the long weekend and we obviously didnt get it 
rising interest rates was one of the key factors that precipitated the financial crisis of  and many fear that it could happen again 
and without a doubt this rise in rates is going to affect the affordability of homes that are already on the market  
if youre going to buy a house and your mortgage payment went up by  or  you may buy a smaller house theres impact on interest rate sensitive sectors like autos and housing and also corporate bonds themselves where financial engineering has helped juice up the equity market said george goncalves head of rate strategy at nomura 
in addition rising rates will make it more difficult for those with adjustable rate mortgages to keep their homes foreclosure activity was already up  percent during the month of october and many are projecting that we could see another giant spike in foreclosures during the months ahead that is similar to what we saw during the last financial crisis 
many trump supporters dont really care what the rest of the world thinks of our new president but this is an area where what the rest of the world thinks really really matters 
the truth is that the rest of the planet is not all too fond of trump and if that makes them a lot less eager to lend us money that is a major problem 
the only way that we can maintain our massively inflated debtfueled standard of living is to continue to borrow gigantic mountains of money from the rest of the world at ultralow interest rates 
if the rest of the world starts demanding higher rates of return now that trump is president we are going to experience economic pain on a scale that most americans dont believe is possible 
one of our big lenders has been china and right now they are deeply   a trump presidency might mean trump has talked very tough about trade with china and the chinese are gearing up for a major trade war the following comes from cnbc  
during his election campaign this year trump spoke of a  percent import tariff on all chinese goods while failing to outline how it would work should any such policy come into effect china will take a titfortat approach according to an opinion piece in the global times  a newspaper backed by the communist party 
a batch of boeing orders will be replaced by airbus us auto and iphone sales in china will suffer a setback and us soybean and maize imports will be halted china can also limit the number of chinese students studying in the us the global times article read 
most trump supporters assume that since trump has been a very successful businessman that he will be able to strengthen the us economy 
but it isnt that simple 
the only reason we are able to live the way that we live today is because we have been able to borrow trillions upon trillions of dollars at irrationally low interest rates 
the moment the rest of the world decides that they are not going to loan us money at irrationally low interest rates any longer the game is over and it wont really matter who is in the white house at that point 
so watch interest rates very carefully if they keep going up it is inevitable that a major economic slowdown will follow no matter what economic policies the new trump administration implements november th   tags bank stocks  bond crash  bond traders  bonds  donald trump  economic news  feel the pain  financial  foreclosure  foreclosure activity  foreclosure activity rising  foreclosure help  foreclosures  foreclosures rising  good news  home foreclosures  pain  stocks  the dollar  the dow  the pain  the stock market  the us dollar  the us economy  the us financial system  trump  us consumers  category housing crash  the economy    mleblanc 
crash and burn house prices crash and burn houses go sky high while wages remain stagnant not sustainable time for a correction an excessive correction genada 
to lose weight you have to take some pain eat less work out same goes with making our economy work for americans we are going to need to take some pain to be able to improve the economy and make it work for every american and not just the top 
the rates had to go up they couldnt really go down anymore and its going to have some negative impacts but those impacts are due to living beyond our means and making bad choices now we will need to pay for that a bit 
lack of lending from others will require us to produce at all and thats a good thing producing at home will lead to more jobs and make us less depend on others less 
then the final major truth about the world economy is and you have detailed many times is that the worlds debt is far in excess of what can be payed its time for write downs and admit this then after the pain of that to put things in place to prevent this from happening again retired 
ultimately we have them all by the gonads with the eu sinking into bankruptcy america will be the last major consumer market left standing the american consumer economy is over  of the total economy the exporting nations have no where else to sell their consumer products  raw materialsthey will need to keep the american economy afloat as for the debtit will never be paidit will be rolled over indefinitely alsothere will be financial chaos around the world when america drops the hammer on the outside world most of the big money from outside will be drawn to america for securitysouth florida is already a haven for wealthy venezuelans who had money parked here for hard times in their homelandcalifornia is in a similar situation with offshore chinese wealth most of the world is part of a global financial system based on american dollars as the worlds reserve currencya large part of the world arein effect provinces in an american financial empireamerica is their bankerthey cant extricate themselves from the dollar  america paul anders 
bottom line is one day soon this house of cards is coming downtrump or no trump but if he can drain the swamp and get the political cesspool back on track i think its worth the pain pain is coming sooner or later anyways retired 
the main thing is to get rid of the central bankers  get a leash on the fire economywhich is mostly huge overhead  is sucking the life out of the real productive economy if it takes pain in the correction we will need to handle it if we want to turn the economic corner castiel

574,goals for the neomasculinity movement during trumps first term," very depressing economic realities that donald trump will inherit from barack obama   th  
it would be a grave mistake to understate the amount of damage that has been done to the us economy over the past eight years in this article i am going to share some economic numbers with you that are extremely sobering anyone that takes a cold hard honest look at the numbers should be able to see that our economy is in terrible shape unfortunately the way that we see things is often clouded by our political views up until the election democrats were far more likely then republicans to believe that the economy was improving but now that is in the process of completely reversing according to gallup  only  percent of republicans believed that the economy was getting better before the election but that number has suddenly jumped to  percent after trumps election victory and the percentage of democrats that believe that the economy is getting better fell from  percent to  percent after the election here are some additional details from gallup  
after trump won last weeks election republicans and republicanleaning independents now have a much more optimistic view of the us economys outlook than they did   just  of republicans said the economy was getting better in the week before the election while  said it was getting worse since the election  say it is getting better and  worse 
conversely democrats and democraticleaning independents confidence in the economy plummeted after the election before the election  of democrats said the economy was getting better and  worse now democrats are evenly divided with  saying it is getting better and  saying it is getting worse 
the truth of course is that the result of the election did not somehow magically alter the outlook for the us economy 
we still have a giant mess on our hands and the following are  very depressing economic realities that donald trump will inherit from barack obama 
 nearly  out of every  americans have less than  in savings  that means that about twothirds of the country is essentially living paycheck to paycheck at this moment 
 reuters is reporting that us mall investors are poised to lose billions of dollars as the  retail apocalypse  in this nation deepens 
 credit card delinquencies have hit the highest level that we have seen since   
 approximately  percent of all americans have a debt that is at least  days past due 
 the rate of homeownership has fallen for eight years in a row and is now hovering near a  year low  
 the total number of government employees now outnumbers the total number of manufacturing employees in this country by almost  million  
 the number of homeless people in new york city where donald trump is from has hit a brand new record high  
 about  percent of all young adults are currently living with their parents  
 total household debt in the united states has now reached a grand total of  trillion dollars  
 the total amount of corporate debt in the us has nearly doubled since the end of  
 when barack obama entered the white house the us government was  trillion dollars in debt today the us national debt is currently sitting at a staggering total of   
despite nearly doubling the national debt during his eight years in the white house barack obama is going to be the only president in united states history to never have a single year when us gdp grew by at least three percent 
so will donald trump waltz in and suddenly turn everything around 
just like when george w bush was elected there is a lot of optimism about the future right now among republicans 
and in  republicans are going to have control of the senate and the house in addition to being in control of the white house 
but does that mean that they will actually get anything done 
for a moment lets review what didnt happen the last time the republicans were in this position the following is an extended excerpt from an article by author devvy kidd   the republicans had control of both houses of congress part of the time during bush jrs two terms did they lock down our borders no did they pass legislation to stop all funding for illegals which would selfdeport millions of liars cheats and thieves no read please how to selfdeport millions of illegals  did they stop trillions in unconstitutional spending no did they get rid of any of clintons unconstitutional executive orders one or two but otherwise let comrade bill clinton crap in our faces did they get rid of one unconstitutional cabinet like hhs department of education and epa no did they stop the unconstitutional foreign aid no did they stop unconstitutional spending for planned parenthood no congress just continues to use borrowed money to spend more debt did they stop unconstitutional spending for the gigantic hoax called global warming or climate change no trump the left just lost the war on climate change did bush jr get us out of all the destructive trade treaties killing american jobs no did they crack down on visas bringing in tens of thousands of foreign workers when american workers who want to work are left in the unemployment line no did they stop more and more federal regulations strangling americas businesses no did they impeach one single activist judge destroying our freedom and liberty no a republican controlled congress with a republican in the white house and they did virtually nothing to restore america to a constitutional republic and constitutional spending  
so will things be any different under a trump administration 
we shall see 
there will be tremendous pressure to maintain the status quo in many instances because the process of fixing things would undoubtedly make conditions worse in the shortterm 
a great example of this is the national debt as i discussed yesterday  the only reason why we are able to enjoy such a massively inflated standard of living in this country     federal government started spending only the money that it brought in through taxes our ridiculous debt  would begin collapsing immediately 
we consume far more wealth than we produce and the only way that we are able to do this is by borrowing insane amounts of money 
either donald trump will continue to borrow money recklessly or we will go into a major league economic downturn 
it really is that simple 
but when our politicians borrow money they are literally destroying the future of this country so the choice is pain in the shortterm or greater pain in the longterm 
there is a way out and that would involve shutting down the federal reserve and going to a completely debtfree form of money but that is a topic for another article 
and unfortunately that is not something that is even on donald trumps radar at this point 
no matter who won the election the next president was going to be faced with some very harsh economic realities 
there are many out there that have faith that donald trump can pull off an unprecedented economic miracle but there are others that are deeply skeptical 
let us hope for the best but let us also keep preparing for the worst",2016-11-16
575,things i learned from being my own general contractor,"why donald trump must shut down the federal reserve and start issuing debtfree money by   th  
if donald trump truly wants to fix the economy he must shut down the federal reserve if he just tries to patch up our current system he will fail because it has been fundamentally flawed from the very beginning a little over a century ago very powerful forces on wall street convinced congress to completely restructure our financial system an immensely powerful central bank known as the federal reserve was created and the goal was to transform the us dollar into a debtbased currency that would continuously be inflated and to create an endless debt spiral from which   could never possibly escape sadly they were successful on both counts since the creation of the federal reserve the value of the us dollar has declined by approximately  percent and our national debt has gotten more than  times larger  
americans tend to give most of the credit or most of the blame for the performance of the us economy to our presidents but the truth is that an unelected unaccountable group of central bankers has far more power over our economy than anyone else does the federal reserve has become known as  the fourth branch of government  but unlike the other branches of government we are told that the feds decisions are above politics because they are too important fed officials fiercely guard their independence and they fiercely resist any interference from congress the president or the american people 
donald trump can try to lower taxes and reduce regulations but what he will be able to do to influence the economy pales in comparison to the immensely powerful tools that the fed wields the fed controls interest rates the fed controls the money supply and the fed regulates the banks 
to give you an idea of how enormously powerful the fed is i want you to pull out a dollar bill 
as you look at that dollar bill i want you to notice that it says federal reserve note right at the top 
in the financial world a note is an instrument of debt and the truth is that our system was designed to create as much debt as possible 
so why are we using debtbased federal reserve notes in the first place shouldnt congress have control over our currency 
according to article i section  of the us constitution  it is congress that has the authority to coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin and fix the standard of weights and measures 
so how did the fed get involved 
well it is a very long and convoluted story and if you are interested in the history behind it i would commend to you an excellent book by c edward griffin entitled  the creature from jekyll island a second look at the federal reserve  basically big money interests on wall street got their hooks into the white house and congress and they rushed through legislation right before christmas in  that created this insidious central banking system that was designed to slowly but surely take wealth from the american people and put it into their hands 
sadly most americans dont even realize that we have a debtbased currency nor do they understand where our money comes from in a previous article  i discussed how money is normally created by the federal reserve under our current system 
when the us government decides that it wants to spend another billion dollars that it does not have it does not print up a billion dollars 
rather the us government creates a bunch of us treasury bonds debt and takes them over to the federal reserve 
the federal reserve creates a billion dollars out of thin air and exchanges them for the us treasury bonds 
the federal reserve takes the us treasury bonds that it receives in exchange for the federal reserve notes that it gave to the government and it auctions off those bonds to the highest bidder  but of course this process always creates more debt than it does money 
the us treasury bonds that the federal reserve receives in exchange for the money it has created out of nothing are auctioned off through the federal reserve system 
but wait 
there is a problem 
because the us government must pay interest on the treasury bonds the amount of debt that has been created by this transaction is greater than the amount of money that has been created 
so where will the us government get the money to pay that debt 
well the theory is that we can get money to circulate through the economy really really fast and tax it at a high enough rate that the government will be able to collect enough taxes to pay the debt 
but that never actually happens does it 
and the creators of the federal reserve understood this as well they understood that the us government would not have enough money to both run the government and service the national debt they knew that the us government would have to keep borrowing even more money in an attempt to keep up with the game 
so our debt just keeps going up and up and up while barack obama has been in the white house our national debt has risen by more than  trillion dollars and at this moment it is sitting just under the  trillion dollar mark  
but we shouldnt be surprised by this because this is precisely what the federal reserve system was designed to do to us 
many conservatives still hold to the mistaken illusion that we could somehow pay all of this debt back someday but as i have shown in a previous article this is mathematically impossible to do  
if the government went out today and grabbed every single dollar in existence we could not pay back the national debt and of course we have   of household debt   of corporate debt and   of state and local government debt that we need to pay back as well 
under the current system our only hope is to keep the wheel spinning by continuing to devalue the dollar and by continuing to go into even greater amounts of debt 
and of course it isnt just the united states that is in this predicament at this point almost every single nation on the entire planet has a central bank 
even though there are extremely sharp disagreements among nations on virtually everything else somehow central banking has achieved nearly universal adoption 
as you read this article well over  of the population of the globe lives in a country that has a central bank 
do you think that is just a coincidence 
of course there are still a few very small countries such as the federated states of micronesia that do not have a central bank but the only big nation not to have one is north korea 
and you would literally have to be insane to want to live in north korea 
but now we have an opportunity to get free from this insidious system the truth is that we dont have to have a central bank in fact the greatest period of economic growth in us history was when there was no central bank  
we dont need central planners to set our interest rates and to manipulate our money supply they will never admit this but the reality of the matter is that their interference in the economy often creates tremendous economic busts 
since the federal reserve was created in  there have been  distinct recessions or depressions                    
considering their track record isnt it time for a change 
and we dont have to have a debtbased currency in fact not too long ago we had a president that decided to start issuing debtfree united states notes 
back in  president john f kennedy issued executive order  which authorized the us treasury to issue debtfree united states notes which were directly created by the us government 
he was assassinated shortly thereafter 
most americans dont realize this but many of the debtfree united states notes that were issued under president kennedy are still in circulation today  and president trump could do something similar 
but will he 
it has been said that the borrower is the servant of the lender and the federal reserve system has turned all of us into debt slaves 
debt is a form of social control and the global elite use all of this debt to dominate the planet the total amount of debt in the world just hit   of  trillion dollars  and the longer we allow the central banks to control the system the bigger this debt bubble will become 
  here in the united states that starts with shutting   issuing debtfree currency it would take someone very bold to make a move like this and so let us hope that the man that we just elected is up to the task",2016-11-16
576,hollywood films for bluepill men that reinforce sjw values and concepts,"why we are still in the danger zone until january th    th  
donald trump is not the president yet and barack obama could still do an extraordinary amount of damage during his last two months in the white house prior to the election i described the period of time ending on january th as the danger zone and my outlook has not changed just because donald trump was victorious on election night as you will see the next two months are an absolutely critical time and if we can get through january th without something major happening perhaps we can breathe a little bit easier at least for a while on the other hand the events of the next two months could easily plunge this country into a period of unprecedented chaos a lot of people are feeling really good about things right now because of trumps victory but now is definitely not a time to relax and let down our guard 
and the truth is that donald trump has not even won the presidency yet as i detailed shortly before election night  the next president will not be determined until december th when the electoral college meets 
on monday december th the members of the electoral college will gather in all  state capitals to cast their votes for president it is then and only then that the next president of the united states will be elected 
throughout our history electors have followed the will of the people more than  perfect of the time but there have been faithless electors before and if democrats can get enough of them to switch sides in december it is still possible though not probable that hillary clinton could win the election 
one petition that is asking electors to switch their votes has already been signed by more than  million people the petition claims that donald trump is unfit to serve as president and that since hillary clinton won the popular vote by a wide margin she should be elected president instead the following comes from a usa today article entitled  could the electoral college elect hillary clinton instead of donald trump  
a changeorg petition now signed by more than  million people encourages members of the electoral college to cast their votes for hillary clinton when the college meets on dec  the petition argues that donald trump is unfit to serve and that secretary clinton won the popular vote and should be president 
if they all vote the way their states voted donald trump will win the petition states however they can vote for hillary clinton if they choose even in states where that is not allowed their vote would still be counted they would simply pay a small fine  which we can be sure clinton supporters will be glad to pay we are calling on the electors to ignore their states votes and cast their ballots for secretary clinton 
personally i dont believe that this is going to happen they may be able to flip a few electors but the gap in electoral votes is almost certainly too wide for the democrats to overcome 
however that is not the only concern we are facing ever since his victory on november th there have been a multitude of violent threats against donald trump and his family and without a doubt there are a lot of very powerful people that would be very interested in finding a way to keep donald trump from getting to inauguration day so let us pray for his safety and for the safety of his family 
if donald trump were to be incapacitated after he wins the electoral college vote on december th mike pence would take his place 
but if something were to happen to him before december th his electors would be free to vote for another candidate  including hillary clinton 
if everything goes smoothly and donald trump successfully makes it to inauguration day he could be facing one of the biggest political protests in united states history 
in an article for the most important news  i showed that the far left is calling for thousands upon thousands of protesters to descend upon washington dc on january th in order to disrupt the inauguration festivities as much as possible 
this giant protest is being organized by the usual suspects and they have already put up facebook pages  websites  and the hashtag disruptj is being widely used all over social media 
traditionally inauguration day is a day of joy and celebration but the far left seems intent on transforming it into a massive riot 
let us hope that they are not successful 
another reason why we will be in the danger zone over the next two months is because of what barack obama may choose to do at the united nations 
now that it looks like donald trump is going to be our next president the international pressure on barack obama to do something at the united nations regarding the israelipalestinian conflict before the end of his term has become even more intense 
and this is something that trump and his advisers are actively concerned about in fact i came across an article earlier today that discussed the fact that the trump team is warning obama against making moves on the israelipalestinian conflict in his last months in office  
saying that pushing agendas contrary to the presidentelects position would not be in the spirit of the transition trump national security advisor for donald trump last week warned the obama administration against making moves on the israelipalestinian conflict in his last months in office 
on big transformative issues where president obama and presidentelect trump are not in alignment i dont think its in keeping with the spirit of the transitionto try to push through agenda items that are contrary to the presidentelects positions the advisor told politico  
specifically the concern is that obama may decide to support a un security council resolution that would officially recognize a palestinian state set the parameters for a two state solution and establish east jerusalem as the capital for the new palestinian state 
just a few weeks ago an article in the wall street journal entitled  obamas israel surprise  reported that this is one of the options that the obama administration is strongly considering right now a un security council resolution would be legally binding on both israel and the palestinians and it would be something that president trump would not be able to undo 
the rest of the un security council is eager to support such a resolution and so the decision about whether this resolution is going to happen or not sits in the hands of barack obama and at this moment we do not know what he is going to do the following comes from an article by leo hohmann  
the wall street journal reported one week before tuesdays election that obama had requested his aides provide him with a list of options to deal with the decadesold israelipalestinian conflict 
israeli diplomats according to the wsj story are preparing for the possibility that a lameduck president obama may try to force a diplomatic resolution for israel and the palestinians at the united nations 
the president is presumably now reviewing those options which number about half a dozen 
he may be preparing to recognize a palestinian state at the un before he leaves office  wsj reported 
if barack obama decides to divide the land of israel at the united nations it will be the worst decision of his entire presidency i have warned repeatedly that all hell will break loose in america if it happens and it will also mean that many of the events that i warn about in my latest book are much closer than many had been anticipating 
but if we can get to january th and the land of israel has not been divided yet we may be able to rest easy for at least a little while because trump has already said that he would not support a un security council resolution that forces a solution on the israelis and palestinians 
when politicians are going to do something that they know people wont like they tend to try to sneak it through around the holidays when a lot of people arent paying attention for example yesterday i discussed how the legislation that created the federal reserve was rushed through congress right before christmas in   
so keep an eye on the period around thanksgiving and the period around christmas if barack obama is going to stab israel in the back it may happen during one of those times 
my hope is that we can get through january th without anything going seriously wrong if that happens i know that i will be very thankful 
and as i detailed in a previous article  donald trump will be  years  months and  days old on his first full day in office on january st and that will happen in year  on the hebrew calendar 
could that be a sign of better things ahead as many believe 
or will the next two months set off a chain of events that will be absolutely disastrous for this nation 
i believe that this is an absolutely critical moment in our history and let us hope that our leaders make the right decisions

i am a political atheist just to set the record straight although i visit this site fairly often it is showing signs of paranoia and provoking fear when george w as elected there were many protesters they were just hidden away in free speech zones of course there are many unhappy people as there were in  and every election trumps votes were less than  of the  million people in the country will trump bring jobs no not unless they are govt employees or funded by taxes there is only one way jobs are created and that is when there is demand for products and services a lot of people with their low paying jobs can hardly afford the basic necessities let alone keep playing the consumerism game i cannot see obama doing anything that requires legislation as he is lame duck status now perhaps this site needs to focus on the swamp getting filled with more careerists especially lobbyists i have been an expat for over  years it is a lovely peaceful warm day here think i will go for a bicycle ride then a dip in  degree seawater i do have faith that not much will change and the sun will continue to rise even when it is obscured by clouds peace and loveit is the only way df nj

yes there is still a possibility that hillary clinton could still get in the oval office but a trump presidency is pretty much a done deal knock on wood the secret service had better guard him and his family very closely from what ive seen and heard president obama is trying to make trumps transition to the presidency very peaceful and orderly even though they hate each other lets hope that trumps presidency will be a successful one and that it heals the many divisions and other issues that plague our country back in  i bought a brand new book called the art of the deal at my college bookstore it was written by some guy named donald trump yes i actually did read it df nj

there are many forms of freedom you criticize the left but you just dont understand it heres how the left thinks 
an old english judge once said necessitous men are not free men liberty requires opportunity to make a living  a living decent according to the standard of the time a living which gives man not only enough to live by but something to live for 
for too many of us the political equality we once had won was meaningless in the face of economic inequality a small group had concentrated into their own hands an almost complete control over other peoples property other peoples money other peoples labor  other peoples lives for too many of us life was no longer free liberty no longer real men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness 
against economic tyranny such as this the american citizen could appeal only to the organized power of government  
you many not agree with this approach but all the evidence shows wealth inequality is at all time highs most of you right wingers claim we have too much socialism and communism in this country the sad fact is we cannot be further way from communism and still have a currency with any shred of value 
but do not fear every year the top  become richer and richer every year the middle class is driven deeper and deeper into poverty wages marx said laissez faire capitialism is always followed by communism because unfettered greed would result in a governments currency collapse once the currency collapses people in bread lines will demand more government not less

577,how the camp of the saints predicted the migrant destruction of europe,"why is obama threatening russia with world war  right before the election   october th  
it sure seems like an odd time to be provoking a war with russia as i write this we stand just a little bit more than three weeks away from one of the most pivotal elections in us history and barack obama has chosen this moment to strongly threaten the russians as i wrote about on friday  reuters is reporting that obama is contemplating direct us military action against syrian military targets and the russians have already indicated that any assault on syrian forces would be considered an attack on themselves the rapidly deteriorating crisis in syria has already caused tensions with russia to rise to the highest level since the end of the cold war but now obama is adding fuel to the fire by publicly considering an unprecedented cyber covert action against russia apparently obama believes that russian hackers are interfering in the election and so he wants payback the following comes from an nbc news article entitled  cia prepping for possible cyber strike against russia  
the obama administration is contemplating an unprecedented cyber covert action against russia in retaliation for alleged russian interference in the american presidential election  us intelligence officials told nbc news 
current and former officials with direct knowledge of the situation say the cia has been asked to deliver options to the white house for a wideranging clandestine cyber operation designed to harass and embarrass the kremlin leadership 
the sources did not elaborate on the exact measures the cia was considering but said the agency had already begun opening cyber doors selecting targets and making other preparations for an operation  
somebody should tell obama that he is not playing a video game a cyber attack is considered to be an act of war and the russians would inevitably retaliate and considering how exceedingly vulnerable our cyber infrastructure is i dont know if that is something that we want to invite 
at the end of last week vice president joe biden also publicly threatened the russians  
on friday vice president joe biden met meet the press host chuck todd for an interview that has raised serious concern in russia 
without bothering to question the authenticity of the claims todd took the allegations of russian hacking at face value opening his interview with a loaded question why havent we sent a message yet to putin 
after a moment of stunned silence biden responded were sending a message we have the capacity to do it and it will be at the time of our choosing and under the circumstances that will have the greatest impact 
when todd asked if the public will know a message was sent biden replied hope not 
the russians firmly deny that they had any involvement in the hacking and so far the obama administration has not publicly produced any firm evidence that the russians were behind it 
perhaps the obama administration privately has some evidence but at this point they have not shown that evidence to the american public 
so for joe biden to be making these sorts of threats is a very dangerous thing the russians are taking these threats very seriously and they are preparing to protect their interests  
the threats directed against moscow and our states leadership are unprecedented because they are voiced at the level of the us vice president 
to the backdrop of this aggressive unpredictable line we must take measures to protect our interests to hedge risks a kremlin spokesman said according to ria novosti news agency 
here in the united states most people dont even realize that we could be on the verge of a major conflict with russia 
but over in russia things are completely different talk of war is everywhere and the potential for war is the number one topic in the russian media right now just check out some of the recent russian media headlines about the conflict between our two nations 
 in contrast to clinton trump has no appetite for war with russia  
and one russian television network recently instructed their viewers to locate the nearest bomb shelter in case a nuclear war between the united states and russia suddenly erupts 
a terrifying russian television broadcast explicitly told civilians to find out where their nearest bomb shelter is and repeatedly asked viewers if they were ready for nuclear war 
one apocalyptic broadcast told viewers on moscows stateowned tv channel ntv if it should one day happen every one of you should know where the nearest bomb shelter is its best to find out now 
i dont believe that the russians are crazy to be thinking that a war might be coming 
to me it almost seems as though obama wants one 
could it be possible that a conflict with russia will be used to alter change or influence the upcoming election in november 
the truth is that it isnt going to take much for the shooting to begin if obama orders airstrikes against syrian forces the russians have said that they will shoot back  
ash carter has threatened russia with consequences after blowing up the ceasefire the pentagon  supported by the joint chiefs of staff  now is peddling potential strikes on syrias air force to punish the regime for what the pentagon actually did blow up the ceasefire one cant make this stuff up 
majorgeneral igor konashenkov russias defense ministry spokesman sent a swift message to our colleagues in washington think twice if you believe you can get away with launching a shadow hot war against russia russia will target any stealthunidentified aircraft attacking syrian government targets  and they will be shot down 
the only serious question then is whether an out of control pentagon will force the russian air force  false flag and otherwise  to knock out us air force fighter jets and whether moscow has the fire power to take out each and every one of them 
i discussed the potential for war with russia in my latest video  hopefully cooler heads will prevail and war with russia will be put off 
but without a doubt the crisis in syria is not going to be resolved any time soon because it is one giant mess most people dont realize that the syrian civil war has essentially been a proxy war between sunni islam and shia islam from the very beginning jihadist rebels that are being armed and funded by saudi arabia and turkey are fighting hezbollah troops that are being armed and funded by iran and now turkish forces have invaded northern syria and this threatens to cause a fullblown war to erupt between turkey and the syrian kurds of course isis is right in the middle of everything causing havoc blowing stuff up and beheading anyone that doesnt believe in their radical version of sunni islam 
it is absolutely insane that the united states and russia could potentially go to war because of this conflict both sides are determined to show the other how tough they are and one false move could set off a spiral of events from which they may be no recovery 
the american people very foolishly elected barack obama twice but up until now the consequences have not been quite as dire as many had been projecting 
however right here at the end of his second term obama is facing a moment of truth if he ends up dragging us into a war with russia the american people will ultimately bitterly regret putting him into the white house drowning in debt  percent of all americans have debt that is at least  days past due  guest 
if he obama ends up dragging us into a war with russia the american people will ultimately bitterly regret putting him into the white house 
oh i doubt it most americans just lap up the propaganda fed to them by the mainstream media that has incessantly demonized putin and other foreign leaders where is the outrage over what this administration has done in destabilizing libya and other sovereign nations in the middle east where is the outrage over what the bush administration did in iraq and afghanistan 
there is a video on youtube with general wesley clark discussing how the pentagon planned to attack  countries in  years google it jc teecher 
the reality of the general public putting an atheisticmuzzy into the white house will not strike home until their sons and daughters are coming home in body bags guest

additionally this lowlife ploy by the progressive liberal democrats is disgusting and changes nothing for many of us jfk was having an ongoing affair with marilyn monroe and im sure his secret service agents could have repeated some rather spicy language in which he described their sexual sessions but you know what neither jfks secret service agents nor the mainstream media said anything about the affair much less jfks private conversations about it because they had dignity respect for the office of potus and respect for jfk any one of those things alone should be enough to keep despicable actions of the democrats and the mainstream media from happening around the whole institution of the potus including the potential potus candidates however we see that neither the democrats nor the mainstream media have any honor truth or journalistic integrity remaining 
general george s patton and prime minister winston churchill were both as crude as they come in private and often in public but they got the job done when they were called upon maybe you dont consider donald trump in the same ranks as the above three men maybe you dont think donald trump can get the job done either way i couldnt care less what i do care about is the poor state of our country the damage that barack obama  the democrats have done and the damage that hillary clinton is sure to do for petes sake look at the shell of a city that used to be detroit mi look at chicago with doubledigit murders just about every week if you want the us to look like these longtime democratrun cities by all means vote for hillary clinton if not then the only other viable option is donald trump

578,reasons you should stop using facebook,"why is obama threatening russia with world war  right before the election michael on television we are being set up for higher interest rates a major recession and a giant stock market crash   november th  
since donald trumps victory on election night we have seen the worst bond crash in  years  global bond investors have seen trillions of dollars of wealth wiped out since november th and analysts are warning of another tough week ahead the general consensus in the investing community is that a trump administration will mean much higher inflation and as a result investors are already starting to demand higher interest rates unfortunately for all of us history has shown that higher interest rates always cause an economic slowdown and this makes perfect sense because economic activity naturally slows down when it becomes more expensive to borrow money the obama administration had already set up the next president for a major recession anyway but now this bond crash threatens to bring it on sooner rather than later 
for those that are not familiar with the bond market when yields go up bond prices go down and when bond prices go down that is bad news for economic growth 
so we generally dont want yields to go up 
unfortunately yields have been absolutely soaring over the past couple of weeks and the yield on  year treasury notes has now jumped one full percentage point since july  
the year treasury yield jumped to  in late trading on friday the highest since december  up  basis point since the election and up one full percentage point since july 
the year yield is at a critical juncture in terms of reality the first thing that might happen is a rate increase by the fed in december after a year of flipflopping a slew of postelection pronouncements by fed heads  including yellens relatively soon  have pushed the odds of a rate hike to  
as i noted the other day  so many things in our financial system are tied to yields on us treasury notes just look at what is happening to mortgages as wolf richter has noted  the average rate on  year mortgages is shooting into the stratosphere 
the carnage in bonds has consequences the average interest rate of the a conforming year fixed mortgage as of friday was quoted at  for top credit scores thats up about  percentage point from just before the election according to mortgage news daily  it put the month on a short list of  worst months in more than a decade 
if mortgage rates continue to shoot higher there will be another housing crash 
rates on auto loans credit cards and student loans will also be affected throughout our economic system it will become much more costly to borrow money and that will inevitably slow the overall economy down 
why bond investors are so on edge these days is because of statements such as this one from steve bannon  
in a nascent administration that seems at best random in its beliefs bannon can seem to be not just a focused voice but almost a messianic one 
like andrew jacksons populism were going to build an entirely new political movement he says its everything related to jobs the conservatives are going to go crazy im the guy pushing a trilliondollar infrastructure plan with negative interest rates throughout the world its the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything ship yards iron works get them all jacked up were just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks it will be as exciting as the s greater than the reagan revolution  conservatives plus populists in an economic nationalist movement 
steve bannon is going to be one of the most influential voices in the new trump administration and he is absolutely determined to get this trillion dollar infrastructure plan through congress 
and that is going to mean a lot more borrowing and a lot more spending for a government that is already on pace to add  trillion dollars to the national debt this fiscal year 
sadly all of this comes at a time when the us economy is already starting to show significant signs of slowing down it is being projected that we will see a sixth straight decline in yearoveryear earnings for the sp  and industrial production has now contracted for  months in a row  
the truth is that the economy has been barely treading water for quite some time now and it isnt going to take much to push us over the edge the following comes from lance roberts  
with an economy running at below  consumers already heavily indebted wage growth weak for the bulk of americans there is not a lot of wiggle room for policy mistakes 
combine weak economics with higher interest rates which negatively impacts consumption and a stronger dollar which weighs on exports and you have a real potential of a recession occurring sooner rather than later 
yes the stock market soared immediately following trumps election but it wasnt because economic conditions actually improved 
if you look at history a stock market crash almost always follows a major bond crash so if bond prices keep declining rapidly that is going to be a very ominous sign for stock traders 
and history has also shown us that no bull market can survive a major recession if the economy suffers a major downturn early in the trump administration it is inevitable that stock prices will follow 
the waning days of the obama administration have set us up perfectly for higher interest rates a major recession and a giant stock market crash 
of course any problems that occur after january th  will be blamed on trump but the truth is that obama will be far more responsible for what happens than trump will be 
right now so many people have been lulled into a sense of complacency because donald trump won the election 
that is an enormous mistake 
a shaking has already begun in the financial world and this shaking could easily become an avalanche 
now is not a time to party rather it is time to batten down the hatches and to prepare for very rough seas ahead 
all of the things that so many experts warned were coming may have been delayed slightly but without a doubt they are still on the way 
so get prepared while you still can because time is running out",2016-11-17
579,the red pill masterpiece that predates them all,"when americans shall say peace and safety by michael snyder on november st  
millions of americans are expecting a new golden age for america under donald trump but is that what they are going to get there is always optimism when a new president is elected but i dont know if i have ever seen anything like the euphoria that many trump supporters are expressing right now look i voted for donald trump and i want him to be as successful as possible but when donald trump becomes our next president on january th  that does not mean that all of the great problems that our nation is facing will somehow magically disappear if you listen to some people they make it sound like america is going to experience nothing but peace prosperity and blessing for decades to come i would love it if that was indeed going to be the case but unfortunately that is simply not the truth 
we are currently on a path that leads to national suicide and unless we change our ways it isnt going to matter who is in the white house 
i keep hearing about how our new president is going to unify the nation but that is going to be extremely difficult to do considering the fact that we are now more divided than ever in fact a brand new gallup survey found that an alltime record high  percent of all americans believe that we are greatly divided when it comes to the most important values  
i keep hearing about how we are now entering a golden age of peace and prosperity but how is that supposed to happen while we are still butchering millions of innocent children in our abortion mills 
i keep hearing about how the economy is about to take off like a rocket but how is that possible when we have already been on the greatest debt binge in world history  the only way we have been able to maintain our massively inflated debtfueled standard of living is by piling up debt at a faster pace than any generation in history today we have accumulated  trillion dollars in consumer debt corporate debt has doubled since the last financial crisis and the national debt is rapidly approaching  trillion dollars how can trump possibly pump up our standard of living with debt more than obama has already done 
i keep hearing about how we are going to make america great again but how can we be great when we are producing more pornography than the rest of the world combined 
i keep hearing about how law and order is going to restored but meanwhile chaos has already been erupting in cities all over the nation and the far left is planning to turn inauguration day into a major riot  
i keep hearing about how things are going to go back to the way they used to be but as i discussed in a previous article  sexuallytransmitted diseases are spreading at the fastest pace in decades the percentage of births out of wedlock is more than  times higher than in  and approximately two out of every three christian men watch pornography on a regular basis 
i keep hearing about how we are going to drain the swamp and yet there are no plans to even reform the federal reserve system which is at the very heart of our financial problems as a nation  
i keep hearing about how good judges are going to be put on the supreme court but how can we trust that when our new president just said that he is fine with the supreme court decision that forced all  states to redefine the institution of marriage 
i keep hearing about how we are going to be an example for the rest of the world but how can we be an example when just about every form of evil imaginable is exploding in popularity inside our own country 
i keep hearing about how our government is going to be blessed but how can a government that gives hundreds of millions of dollars a year to planned parenthood be blessed now that the republicans have control of the white house the senate and the house of representatives this is their golden opportunity to defund planned parenthood if it doesnt happen now it probably will never happen and it will show what a complete and utter failure the republican party has become remember planned parenthood is an organization that has been caught on camera admitting that they harvest organs from the babies that they kill and that they sell those organs off to the highest bidder 
some would argue that america is already great at a lot of things after all the united states is number one in the world in television watching legal drug use and illegal drug use

we have the highest std infection rate in the industrialized world the highest divorce rate in the industrialized world and the largest prison population on the entire planet 
we also have the most complicated tax system in the entire world the largest trade deficit in the entire world and the largest national debt in the entire world 
so if we want to make america great again we sure have a lot of work to do 
the complacency that i am seeing out there right now really alarms me so many people seem to think that the battle is won because donald trump was victorious on election night but that is not even close to reality 
if we do not fundamentally change course as a nation we will not survive tinkering with tax rates regulations and trade agreements is not going to get the job done so many people are acting as if we just have a few cuts and scratches when the reality is what our country really needs is major heart surgery 
donald trump is not some sort of a messiah and even if he is able to accomplish every single thing that he is promising right now it will not nearly be enough 
but for the moment millions of americans are proclaiming peace and safety now that donald trump has won the election and we shall see how it all turns out november st   tags americans  anxiety  blessing  donald trump  national suicide  peace  safety  successful  suicide  trump  category commentary we are being set up for higher interest rates a major recession and a giant stock market crash",2016-11-17
580,how to live after trump,"are the polls rigged against trump all of these wildly divergent surveys cannot possibly be correct michael on television half of the population of the world is dirt poor  and the global elite want to keep it that way   nd  
could you survive on just  a day according to compassion international  approximately half of the population of the entire planet currently lives on  a day or less meanwhile those hoarding wealth at the very top of the global pyramid are rapidly becoming a lot wealthier dont get me wrong  i am a very big believer in working hard and contributing something of value to society and those that work the hardest and contribute the most should be able to reap the rewards in this article i am in no way shape or form criticizing true capitalism because if true capitalism were actually being practiced all over the planet we would have far far less poverty today instead our planet is dominated by a heavily socialized debtbased central banking system that systematically transfers wealth from hard working ordinary citizens to the global elite those at the very top of the pyramid know that they are impoverishing everyone else and they very much intend to keep it that way 
lets start with some of the hard numbers according to zero hedge  credit suisse had just released their yearly report on global wealth and it shows that  percent of all the wealth in the world is controlled by just  percent of the people 
as credit suisse tantalizingly shows year after year the number of people who control just shy of a majority of global net worth or  of the roughly  trillion in household wealth is declining progressively relative to the total population of the world and in  the number of people who are worth more than  million was just  million roughly  of the worlds population of adults on the other end of the pyramid some  billion adults had a net worth of less than  accounting for just about  trillion in household wealth 
and since this is a yearly report we can go back and see how things have changed over time when zero hedge did this it was discovered that the wealth of those at the very top has nearly doubled over the past six years and meanwhile the poor have gotten even poorer 
incidentally we tracked down the first credit suisse report we found in this series from   where the total wealth of the top layer in the pyramid was a modest  trillion for the worlds millionaires it has nearly doubled in the  years since then meanwhile the worlds poorest have gotten you got it poorer as those adults who were worth less than  in  had a combined net worth of  trillion a number which has since declined to  trillion in  despite a half a billion increase in the sample size 
if these trends continue at this pace it wont be too long before the global elite have virtually all of the wealth and the rest of us have virtually nothing 
perhaps you are fortunate enough to still have a good job and you live in a large home and you will sleep in a warm bed tonight 
well you should consider yourself to be very blessed because that is definitely not the case for most of the rest of the world the following  facts about global poverty come from dosomethingcom  and i want you to really let these numbers sink in for a moment nearly  of the worlds population  more than  billion people  live on less than  a day more than  billion live in extreme poverty  less than  a day  billion children worldwide are living in poverty according to unicef  children die each day due to poverty  million people worldwide do not have enough food to eat  food banks are especially important in providing food for people that cant afford it themselves run a food drive outside your local grocery store so people in your community have enough to eat sign up for supermarket stakeout  more than  million people lack adequate access to clean drinking water  diarrhea caused by inadequate drinking water sanitation and hand hygiene kills an estimated  people every year globally or approximately  people per day in   million children under the age  were stunted reduced rate of growth and development due to chronic malnutrition preventable diseases like diarrhea and pneumonia take the lives of  million children a year who are too poor to afford proper treatment as of   million children under  year of age worldwide had not received the three recommended doses of vaccine against diphtheria tetanus and pertussis  of all humans live without electricity  approximately  billion people  of the world population lives on less than  a day  oxfam estimates that it would take  billion annually to end extreme global povertythats less than  the income of the top  richest billionaires the world food programme says the poor are hungry and their hunger traps them in poverty hunger is the number one cause of death in the world killing more than hivaids malaria and tuberculosis combined 
so how did we get here 
debt is the primary mechanism that takes wealth from ordinary people like you and me and puts it into the hands of the global elite 
in my recent article entitled  why donald trump must shut down the federal reserve and start issuing debtfree money  i discussed how the federal reserve was designed to entrap the us government in an endless debt spiral from which it could never possibly escape and that is precisely what has happened as the us national debt has gotten more than  times larger since the federal reserve was created in  
in that very same year the federal income tax was instituted and that is a key part of the program for the global elite you see the income tax is how wealth is transferred from us to the government and then a continuously growing national debt is how that wealth is transferred from the government to the elite 
it is a very complicated system but at the end of the day it is all about taking money from us and getting it into their pockets 
and at this point more than  percent of the population of the world lives in a country with a central bank and almost every nation on the planet has some form of income tax 
it is a global system that is designed to create as much debt as possible and i recently shared with my readers that the total amount of debt in the world has hit a staggering   of  trillion dollars  
interestingly the bible actually foretells of a time when rich men would hoard wealth in the last days the following are the first five verses of the book of james in the modern english version  
come now you rich men weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you  your riches are corrupted and your garments are motheaten  your gold and silver are corroded and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire you have stored up treasures for the last days  indeed the wages that you kept back by fraud from the laborers who harvested your fields are crying and the cries of those who harvested have entered into the ears of the lord of hosts  you have lived in pleasure on the earth and have been wayward you have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter 
so much of the time we focus on the other great sins that we see all around us but the truth is that one of the greatest sins of all in our world today is the sin of greed 
the borrower is the servant of the lender and the global elite have used various forms of debt to turn the rest of the planet into their debt slaves 
as debt levels race higher and higher all over the planet the elite are using the magic of compound interest to grab a bigger and bigger share of the pie 
given enough time those at the very top would have virtually everything and the rest of us would have virtually nothing the middle class is shrinking all over the globe and the gap between the wealthy and the poor continues to grow at an astounding pace 
but the vast majority of people out there have no idea how money debt taxes and central banks really work and so they have no idea that this is purposely being done to them 
so please share this article with as many people as you can the truth is that we dont have to have this much global poverty and if we correctly identify the root causes of this poverty we can start working on some real solutions",2016-11-17

the reason that american police love just shooting people instead of actually working and risking their safety for the safety of the people is because they are blood thirsty cowboy dirty harry brain washed psychopaths that love killing it is american culture at the root deep in the psyche 
the police have been militarized they dont do the job like in the old days no more negotiators drs or counselling at the scene of the crisis its just shoot bang bang boom yourr dead if you had a gun knife glow stick sandwich whatever gary honeycutt 
how old are you the old days you mention with negotiators and counselors came into vogue nationally in the s after a period of democrat rule notable for their most outstanding accomplishment a huge escalation of criminals rights over those of victims note the escalation of crime since then it seems you are also on the anticop bandwagon i support them being able to defend themselves mistakes can be made in a split second the same amount of time it might take for a criminal to kill a cop im sure you can name victims of cops do you realize what a small percentage of interactions between cops and the public they constitute unfortunately the justified shootings like the ferguson case are unfairly included in many of our perceptions first and foremost dont commit crime that improves your odds drastically next comply with orders given by the police if you were raised to treat the police as hostile someone failed you guilty or innocent comply the police are just trying to do their job dont complicate it ive seen many an arrest where a person taunts and struggles with the police even up to resisting being put in the car try walking a mile in their shoes they are trying to keep the public safe and they have a right to be safe themselves fluffnik 
guilty or innocent comply 
land of the free 
most places are successfully policed by consent and without shooting their citizens or suffering much crime gary honeycutt 
yes if an officer wants to see identification he has a reason if he wants you to keep your hands in plain sight he has a reason he is possibly ruling you out as a person of interest that was seen in the area imagine how much more efficiently that would go if each person would refrain from shouting about their rights for  minutes before complying if you are the person in question the transaction could be handled in a couple of minutes and youll be gone without any violence or hard feelings if you pay taxes you will have helped us get our moneys worth of course if youve seen the news and the reality shows you may have the impression that a lot of these guys that are giving a cop a load of crap probably live off of what you are paying to the government mike 
wasnt raised hostile to cops family members are cops as a matter of fact this is america if im not committing a crime or suspected of it dont ask me for papers dont detain me dont run dui checkpoints those are infringements on all of our freedom which i assume we love safety is what the left uses to excuse their behavior safety is a fallacy dufas_duck 
i have had  police officers in my extended family it got to the point that none of them were welcome into the rest of the familys homes they were eventually never invited to family get to gathers they were rude overbearing malicious individuals constantly bragging how they screwed some person and taught them how the world really should be their treatment of family members were more along the line of petty dictators where no matter the subject some familly member was wrong petty things like they didnt like the car they bought or their haircut or the job they worked at they were not satisfied with anything or anybody 
they brought their street attitude home with them they couldnt keep wives or husbands or significant others for very long they were arrogant mean and only thaought of themselvesanybody else was in their way 
i have seen gang members that have more ethics than these police and their freinds gary honeycutt 
my greatgrandfather his soninlaw my grandfatherand his son my uncle were all cops the oldest and youngest for their whole careers all deeply religious highly moral men dufas_duck 
that is great if they were straight arrow we need more like them my cop relatives and their friends would fit right in in the crips the bloods or just about any outlaw motorcycle club no one but other cops were proud of them my family sure wasnt proud of them gary honeycutt 
maybe they became hardened by what they faced daily east side of detroit south side of chicago people are products of their environment maybe the cops in branson mo and such places are nice guys what is the ratio of cops to citizens lets say youve got a playground with   year olds you get a dozen  year olds to keep order among them if the  are from sierra leone and the dozen are american boy scouts thered be  dead americans in short order any dead among the  wouldve been killed by their own so what do we expect of cops who grew up without a rap sheet graduated from school and passed the academy you think  years of patrolling the gnetto might change them they surely know the realities of the job better than we do how do the ones who arent in mayberry do a  or  year career in an inner city where shooting a cop makes you a hero and not resisting arrest makes you a pussy dufas_duck 
i do know that where i grew up the police at least tried to keep the officers from getting street hardened they rotated officers to different districts every month but then they found thst the police were trading assignments some cops didnt want to rotate out they wanted to stay where they were no explaination was given by any officerat least publically no answer was given 
many thought the cops were up to no good and wanted to stay in their own area to protct their interst dufas_duck 
you just gave the cops an excuse to act like gang members gary honeycutt 
i dont think so but you dont throw choirboys in blue to the wolves in the ghetto any more than you send a seal team to lifeguard the kiddie pool dufas_duck 
 send a seal team to lifeguard the kiddie pool 
you havent checked out what school cops have been doing as of late then a  year old in handcuffs or throwing an  year old to the ground doesnt work out to be the way to increase trust among the populace anthony fredericks 
i will end this stupidity of your right now gary i work with police every single day as a emt every day i am a qualified expert on how police act on scenemost of them are very arrogant rude and aggressive towards people shut up or be quiet is the first thing you normally hear from a cop you always see them put someone on the ground even if that person is the one who called them for help if they dont like youboom face down knee on your neck cuffs on approximately  are not like this but the other  are this is reality gary and i have worked in several cities in different areasand it is all the same police are overbearing and have a chip on their shoulder against the general publicand a lot of them take it out physically on them gary honeycutt 
my sympathies for the flaw in your familys dna dufas_duck 
luckily the flaw was only in the extended family treeinlaws marriages etc  gary honeycutt 
most people who oppose dui checkpoints have a reason ive always seen a problem with bars having parking lots when it is illegal for good reason to drink and drive i dont mind providing my id when a cop asks for it when its done without giving him any lip it is over quickly without incident hes just trying to do the job we are paying for if you want to launch into a  minute tirade about your rights youll be there  minutes longer make it a bad night at work for the cop and wind you all up maybe you like that some people love drama mike 
the reason is its an infringement on your rights and unnecessarily exposes you and the officers to a potentially dangerous confrontation there is no way you believe that unwanted contact that is forced upon officers and the public increases their safety i wouldnt blame the officers for the policies they have to enforce however the higher ups never pay when things go wrong after the fact the problem with being law abiding is that by doing nothing wrong you dont see the infringement of your rights and tolerate them just because you arent guilty of anything doesnt mean your rights arent being taken from you what if for safety we decided that all firearms need removed from private citizens what if we decided that tsa should run mandatory random checkpoints all over the us creating  hour delays what if we decided that anyone that supports trump may be a violent extremist and should be stopped for questioning do you see where this goes 
i dont like the immigration ones inside the states of the southwest i dont like the agricultural ones into california and i dont like the dui checkpoints in the south im a legal resident dont transport crops and dont drink yet i oppose all of them the idea behind them is wellmeaning the execution is unlawful imo obviously the courts dont think so or theyd not exist gary honeycutt 
it is the officers job to initiate that confrontation despite the risk to himself he does it to lessen the chance that a drunk will run over you daughter at a crosswalk he stops people who fit the description of a wanted person in hopes of catching a criminal before he claims another victim perhaps raping your daughter what would you do in his place mike 
you are confusing the issues here zero issue stopping and talking with someone who is suspected or witnessed committing a crime 
dui checkpoints are  stop and question with zero probable cause have you been in states where they run these the road is barricaded even turning around prior to the checkpoint leads to confrontation with the police as you are assumed to be committing a crime for not wanting to be questioned you are within your rights to be polite and refuse the checkpoint but the fact that they exist trouble me as do any checkpoints as they are not based on probable cause gary honeycutt 
and youve seen these checkpoints at pm by a suburban baptist church no the probable cause lies in them being near the strip at am where there is a history of alcoholrelated incidents mike 
i lived in the south these things were not targeting a specific demographic as far as i could tell and while not at pm that i can recall they werent that late and they sure could have been in front of a baptist church i could have been naive about who was being targeted i wasnt just waived through once they saw my skin color but my point is that the location doesnt matter nor does the target demographic if there is one they are unjust and just like every other forced interaction with law enforcement does not serve to increase the safety of leos 
if police pull me over because a car that looks like mine just robbed a quickie mart or a guy like me was just reported for beating his wife or ran off with a kid i do not have a problem with that they have probable cause and the risk to their safety and mine is worth it because they may be stopping a criminal stop me detain me for a reasonable time until they can prove i am or am not who they are looking for then let me be on my way 
however ive been stopped in a rural area for making a right turn on red perfectly legal in my state and the officer was a complete ass enough that had i a short fuse it could have quickly escalated after that encounter and talking with the state about why the previously posted no turn on red sign had been removed from that intersection for a couple of months the fact that this officers supervisor backed him up for an unlawful stop and threatening that they could have written me up and i would have to prove in court i didnt break the law just proved to me that some police are uninterested in doing what is right depending on the circumstances that officer had no reason to stop me although i suspect since it was near his house and he is a rural county officer he couldnt control his road rage and by doing so he put himself at risk as well as me there are a million what ifs in that situation not the least of which was the fact that even though he pulled me over in the dark along a fairly rural road by himself he didnt call in the stop which is procedure for that department i could have ended up shot or he could have and dispatch would have never known 
increasing negative interaction with the public is never in a leos best interest for safety and reputation of the police as a whole dufas_duck 
i guess thats why the police looking for a skinny black man that is wearing a white sweatshirt and is  foot that just commited a robbery would shoot a short foot  kid wearing a dark gray sweat shirt in the back as he was walking down the sidewalk at a fast pace turned out that the man they shot was pizza delivery in a hurry to deliver the next order before it cooled off 
police shooting two small white females in a light blue pickup truck while the cops were looking a huge black man in a dark gray pickup truck is perfectly aok 
in the town that i live in police shot and killed a  year old kid while he slept maybe we should all congraduate the officer because he only used three bullets he could have emptied his clip 
maybe the cops that you love are making things more efficient by killing anyone and everyone to save the taxpayers that you are so worried about any money a couple of bullets is cheaper than some cops time to find out what really is going on 
of course some of those evil peoples relitives will probably sue but so what the tax payers will take care of that 
how do you feel about cops who demand sex from some random female and when she refuses gets arrested for your noncompliance 
you would love my uncle he was a cop and really got off when he could beat or kill someone after about fifteen years of bullying beating killing and making false charges against people the force finally fired himmeanwhile he ruined hundreds of lives and they were not you welfare people that he abused it was anybody he could screw with 
but in your mind police can do no wrongmaybe you are right police are always telling us that they never do anything wrong especialy when they investigate themselves or have a friendly agency do the investigation gary honeycutt 
i dont deny that there are a small percentage of cops that shouldnt be or wrong splitsecond decisions sometimes think about how many police officers there have been over the span of time you draw your examples from think about the number of times per day that an leo comes in contact with a citizen that taken into account bad contacts are extremely rare the sensationalism of all these female teachers having sex with students is stuck in everyones mind but they dont consider the huge number of teachers and students and note how statistically rare these incidents are the incidents dont sour me on the entire education system we need law enforcement you are good at pointing out the flaws but do you have a solution will any form of policing be perfect what is dufas_duck 
how about having honest police and policing while percentage wise there is a small number of truley bad cops but there is always a but a large percentage of your good cops will keep silent lie or even cover for the bad cops that extends up through the ranks to the top of the police forces those honest cops that do come forward are setting themselves up to fail and eventually destroy their careerscops dont like whistleblowers 
the example you used teachers having sex with students is perfect once it is found that a teacher has crossed the line even a suspicion that the teacher has done something will bring immeadiate consequenses not so within the police a bad policeman can get away with things multiple times sometimes going on for years the upper eschalon figures out ways to cover for the errant cop at almost every turn even if convicted the court system will come in later on appeal and remove parts or all of any punishment 
for years the public was kept in the dark about the bad cop very few were brought to justice only the very extreme cases of crooked cops were adjudicated it is just lately after public attention that the police are starting to somewhat clean house 
there are child molesting police officers that are still working as officers many are just put on probation others are allowed to retun to police work after their incarceration 
it would also be a boon to the public if we had a justice system instead of a legal system a legal system can be whatever its practicinors want it to be a justice system looks for truth no matter where it points to quilified and absolute immunity for police das judges does not lend itself to anything close to justice 
police are a necessary evilthe are some evil people in the world it is just too bad that many of them are police officers gary honeycutt 
keep silent lie or even cover turn off the tv and go out i to the world some will agree with you but if youd said the same thing about black people thered be trouble dont you think just about any group might share the same likelihood of bending the rules they also dont like criminals in uniform and are just as likely to line up against a bad apple do cops get away with small indiscretions and occassionally a major crime probably but more so than the general population interesting take on the teacher thing i remember a fellow who got a job as a girls basketball coach at a very small rural school he was no prize in his youth and i guess when an equally awkward underage player on his team developped a crush on him he couldnt resist she got pregnant and to add to a volatile situation her uncle was the superintendent of schools flash ahead maybe  years give or take and im a teacher and football coach in that same system at a slightly larger rural school i work with a married couple both tenured teachers probably on full retirement now after full careers without ever being fired downsized transferred or any of the other things that may befall teachers during their careers the hubby is the boys basketball coach and unofficially the assistant principle guess who yep dufas_duck 
ive been out in the world for over  years been beat by cops and then have them later discover i wasnt the perp they were looking for i was only lucky in that the cops didnt make up charges to cover their tails they just lied about what went down and covered for each other in this instance everything happened because i was driving the same make model color and year of vehicle that was used in a felony crime on the way to jail a radio message came in telling the cops to stand down the perp had been caught and identified the cops just turned around and dumped me back at my vehicle 
i think if you would reread what i posted it was the cops that i refered to as being giged for turning in another cop not the teachers in todays world a teacher will be messed with just on a rumer if you as a coach had rumers that you were messing with the kids i dont think you would have lasted in that positionunless you are stating you were messing with the kids and no on ratted on you gary honeycutt 
no i wasnt referring to myself i was an outsider where the good ol boy superintendent had a slew of relatives and even more buddies on the payroll i think the guy in my story shouldve done time and never been allowed to work with kids again dufas_duck 
addendum 
i get the feelig that you are the type that if a policeman makes a mistake the officer should get a pass because everybody makes mistakes police are supposed to be trained on how to back off those split second decisions even in the military soldier makes a mistake and if it is not covered up the soldier faces the consequenses but there are many that think that the killing some kid by a policeman is aok like the two policemen that were canvassing a nieghborhood knocking on doors and a  year old kid opens the door while holding a ps game controller cop shouts gun and  shots lateran innocent kid is dead and bleeding out in his own home while the playstation is running in the background and the cops get another pass thats the kind of policing that you want 
yet a mechanic makes a mistake while repairing or sevicing your vehicle and it leads to a death of an innocent personthe mechanic can be held liable both were mistakeswhy should a mechanic be held responsible and the cop not be anthony fredericks 
theres no excuse for killing a person gary we have laws against that no im sorry brings back people after being killed by over reacting cops no gary accidents like that are not excusable i dont care what job you have soldiers in warzones who kill innocent people are brought up on charges of murder why would it be ok for a stupid beat cop to be able to do it gary honeycutt 
selfdefense is a valid reason and the police have as much right to it as anyone and more likelihood to find themselves in that situation due to the nature of their jobs people like to argue the case of an unarmed attacker should only mma champions be allowed to be cops an unarmed attacker can kill you if someone breaks into my house at night i will do whatever it takes to keep him from doing harm to myself or family i will not wait to see if hes armed or ask his intentions i wont refrain from using a weapon because i dont see him with one it is not a high school wrestling match we wont get up and shake hands after it is decided by score if this same criminal finds me awake and decides to leave at once i will call a cop it is his job to confront this person and resistance by the suspect places him in the same situation i was in when someone invaded my home fluffnik 
i live in scotland where the police do not routinely carry guns mostly noone dies anthony fredericks 
you mean like the guy who got shot in his car for trying to give his id to the cop or maybe you are talking about the social worker that was trying to bring back his autistic patient and the com while he was on his back with his hands straight in the air how about those huh gary i could go on and on but a close minded sheep like you would never see the forest through the trees anthony fredericks 
so gary if i seen you walking towards me on the street got scared because you looked dangerous and i accidentally defended myself by blowing your head off then all i have to say is oh sorry my bad and because accidents happen everything is ok right take your head out of the sandpolice kill people when they think their authority is being challenged not their lives they are protecting their egos mike 
while i wont disagree completely with your statement blanket statements are never correct some police may kill from challenges to authority in most cases it is a kill or be killed split second decision that we not being in the exact same position should not second guess what we should be secondguessing are the supervisors chiefs and elected officials who hire bad cops improperly train their officers and put officers in harms way where they should not be the higherups never pay the price for those under them whose actions they are responsible for that is a very real problem if we want change we need to hold our elected officials responsible for the behavior of the officers that indirectly work for them 
programs such as stop and frisk checkpoints etc all require a confrontation with individuals that do not need to occur that puts officers and the publics lives at risk neither is acceptable the easy solution is to stop making the confrontations occur but you do something stupid michael brown you deserve what you get 
i wish organizations like black lives matter would pick individuals to use as martyrs who were actually victims there are a lot of people who would agree with some of the basic ideas espoused but when you choose the perpetrators of crime who just happened to get theirs as your martyrs you expose your cause as being about something other than justice gary honeycutt 
you can put that example back where you pulled it fromif your head isnt in the way bj 
thats actually standard in every part of the world except usa its normal for police to protect and serve  it is not normal for police to shoot first ask later jack mccauley 
will someone hurry and inform the usa jeeeez its embarassing troothfairy",2016-11-18
582,what modern south korea is like,"home  badge abuse  genius child arrested interrogated and thrown in juvi by hero cops for making a homemade clock genius child arrested interrogated and thrown in juvi by hero cops for making a homemade clock john vibes september    comments 
irving tx  an intelligent and talented th grader was arrested this week for bringing a homemade clock into school yearold ahmed mohamed is interested in electronics and has taught himself how to make his own radios and other devices he can even repair his own gokart 
recently he made a clock that he was proud of so he decided to take it into school and show his classmates and teachers sadly instead of celebrating his achievement one of his teachers called the police on him because they thought that it might be a bomb 
when the police arrived they took the threat seriously and believed that it could be a bomb as well even though it obviously wasnt eventually the police charged him with making a clock and misrepresenting it as a bomb even though he consistently told everyone that it was a clock and denied that it was a bomb when the teachers or the police suggested it 
the young man was then handcuffed and taken to a juvenile detention center and his clock was taken and put in an evidence room he was also suspended from school and was unable to attend a student council meeting that he was scheduled to be a part of 
here in high school none of the teachers know what i can do ahmed told dallas news after the incident 
he then explained that when he showed his engineering teacher what he created he was warned not to show it to the other teachers 
he was like thats really nice i would advise you not to show any other teachers ahmed said 
he then kept the clock in his bag until his english class when the alarm went off and disturbed his teacher after the class ahmed showed his teacher what was making the noise and she accused him of bringing a bomb to school 
she was like it looks like a bomb he said 
i told her it doesnt look like a bomb to me he explained 
the teacher took the clock from him and he had expected that was the end of it however towards the end of the day ahmed was pulled out of class and taken to a room filled with police officers 
he said that the officers then attempted to get him to admit that he tried to make a bomb 
they were like so you tried to make a bomb  ahmed said 
i told them no i was trying to make a clock 
the officer then told him  it looks like a movie bomb to me 
the police even admit that ahmed never once said the device was a bomb and they never had any reason to believe that it actually was one but the police still seemed to think he was lying about something even though they didnt have any proof 
we have no information that he claimed it was a bomb he kept maintaining it was a clock but there was no broader explanation police spokesman james mclellan said 
it could reasonably be mistaken as a device if left in a bathroom or under a car the concern was what was this thing built for do we take him into custody he added 
they couldnt possibly imagine that a young man would want to teach himself a valuable skill and share his achievement with his teachers 
they thought how could someone like this build something like this unless its a threat ahmed said 
ahmeds father mohamed elhassan mohamed believes that his family is being discriminated against 
he just wants to invent good things for mankind but because his name is mohamed and because of sept  i think my son got mistreated he said 
there has since been an outpour of support on social media since ahmeds story went public he has even gotten support from mark z and president obama cool clock ahmed want to bring it to the white house we should inspire more kids like you to like science its what makes america great

583,men are binded by their shared realization of truth,"home  badge abuse  cop fired after shooting own yearold daughter at a halloween party cop fired after shooting own yearold daughter at a halloween party matt agorist november   leave a comment 
lincolnton nc  time and again police prove that the government having a monopoly on the use of weapons is a terrible idea a glaring example of this incompetence is evidenced through a recent case in north carolina in which a police officer shot her own daughter 
on monday the lincoln county sheriffs office announced that deputy misty michelle flowers  was terminated after she shot her yearold daughter over the weekend 
the shooting happened as flowers who is entrusted by the state to act responsibly with a firearm was showing off her service weapon to friends saturday night when she squeezed the trigger the bullet then went through the wall and hit her daughter in another room 
i find gross negligence and the disregard for the safety of others was displayed in the incident saturday night and therefore officer flowers was terminated today sheriff david carpenter said this is totally separate from the sbi investigation into the incident that occurred at her residence 
according to wncn 
lincoln county deputies said they were called to the home at  pm and started tending to the girls injury the child was taken to chslincoln and then airlifted to carolinas medical center in charlotte for surgery according to deputies she was in stable condition after treatment 
neighbors say there was a halloween party going on at the house where this happened 
flowers has been with the lincoln county sheriffs office since  and worked for the catawba county sheriffs office before that 
during this entire situation my focus has been on the wellbeing and condition of the child involved and am of the understanding the child is going to be ok after the surgery this is a very tragic situation for all involved the officer her family her career and everyone that has been touched by this carpenter said we continue to pray for healing of the child and the entire family as the investigation continues over the next several days 
according to the sbi an investigation into the incident is still ongoing it is unclear whether or not flowers will face any charges 
this is the second such incident in only a week in which a police officer accidentally fired their weapon endangering the lives of children last week the free thought project reported on the ohio cop who fired his weapon into a daycare center while it was fully occupied 
despite the officer clearly admitting to committing the misdemeanor offense of discharging a firearm within city limits police have yet to charge him 
right now our law department has it and they are reviewing it to see if there should be any charges police chief jack davis said last wednesday morning 
it was a very unfortunate incident for the school as well as him he added 
outside of skating out of the misdemeanor charge so far this officer also seems to be avoiding the felony offense of discharging a weapon in a gunfree school zone 
imagine for a moment that you were showing off your pistol to friends at a halloween party and all of the sudden you accidentally squeeze off a round and shoot your own daughter 
there are two possible scenarios that would take place the first one being that a swat team responds and you are killed the second less lethal result would be your inevitable arrest and charges of public endangerment unlawful discharge illegal use of a firearm assault with a deadly weapon terrorism or a myriad of other charges associated with sending a deadly projectile hurling through a wall and into a child you would immediately be facing fines jail time probation and firearms restrictions 
however if you are a government agent whos trusted with carrying a deadly weapon into places others cannot you neednt worry about any of those repercussions matt agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world follow mattagorist on twitter and now on steemit share",2016-11-19

a massive explosion of a gas pipeline in shelby county alabama  near the site where the same pipeline leaked some  gallons of gasoline just last month  evidences the exact reason activists and native american water protectors oppose the construction of the dakota access pipeline over  miles to the northwest 
one person was killed and at least five people were injured in the blast  tentatively described as an accident  as colonial pipeline shut down operations black smoke billowed sending millions into a panic over the abrupt and unexpected coming gas shortage 
our deepest condolences go out tonight to the family and friends of the person who was lost today and our thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured colonial said in a statement reported nbc news  
cited by the chicago tribune  alabama governor robert bentley said the explosion occurred roughly a mile west of last months rupture adding of the likely crippling shortage of fuel well just hope and pray for the best 
it appears to have been an accident and theyre allowing fuel to burn bentley told wbrc  its about one mile west of where the repair took place on the colonial pipeline just recently liveon  brianpia reports on colonial pipeline company history after todays explosion in shelby county httpstcojjmncsce pictwittercomyntwos 
 abc  news abc october   
refined gas poured from the pipeline as workers rushed to construct a footlong earthen dam to contain the flaming spill where fuel will then be allowed to burn itself out dry tinder from an ongoing drought in the area quickly ignited two wildfires after the explosion  which then charred  acres  and area residents were forced to evacuate without any indication when they would be permitted to return 
theres a large plume of smoke theres a large fire noted shelby county sheriffs captain jeff hartley as quoted by the chicago tribune  were not sure exactly how it started or what caused it he said adding of the massive deployment of fire and emergency personnel weve got first responders entering the area and a lot of them 
apart from the worker killed subsequent reports downplayed the extent of injuries suffered by those at the blast site alcom reported seven of the eight or nine subcontractors working in the area had suffered severe burns from the explosion according to shelby county sheriff john samaniego two of those workers  all of whom had begun digging in an effort to flush one of the lines as repairs continued on the original leak  may still be missing  though that information was both unconfirmed and unclear because extreme heat from flames emanating at the site of the explosion prevented further assessment 
colonial noted in a brief statement cited by a local abc affiliate that both pipelines  one transporting gasoline the other distillates had been shut down and further 
colonials top priorities are the health and safety of the work crew on site and protection of the public 
according to a later report from reuters  the fire had been contained by around  pm local time  yet no further word about the possiblymissing subcontractors has been provided incredible video of the colonial pipeline leak from ryan burtis our thoughts  prayers to all pictwittercomnuodoawo 
 wbrc fox news wbrcnews october   
fears of yet another gas shortage akin to that from the september leak  as well as consequent soaring prices  spawned lengthy lines at gas stations as soon as news of the explosion hit headlines reuters explains 
colonial the biggest refined products system in the united states is responsible for supplying about onethird of the  million barrels per day of gasoline consumed on the east coast according to us energy department data 
further it was not clear whether the explosion happened on the gasoline or the distillates pipeline the governor said in the briefing 
although the aforementioned details handily summarize the facts of the explosion  occurring during active repairs of the previous sizeable leak  the facts do little to quantify potential environmental and health impacts of an explosion and leak of this magnitude 
this explosion of a major pipeline supplying fuel to large portions of the southeast and east coast serves an ominous portent for ongoing opposition to construction of the hotly contentious dakota access pipeline slated to cross four states traversing just north of the standing rock sioux reservation in north dakota 
standing rock sioux water protectors and native americans and indigenous peoples from over  nations and their supporters fear that pipelines route  undercutting the missouri river in several places  threatens to poison the tribal water supply and that of no less than  million others living downstream indeed the colonial pipelines tragic mishap  the second in essentially the same section of pipe in about one month  darkly parallels the hundreds of similar accidents such pipelines are prone to 
residents of bismarck aware of big oils horrendous safety record managed to thwart energy transfer partners original plans for the pipeline to be routed near the city  so etp with assistance from the state diverted dakota access to cross just north of the standing rock sioux reservation on privatelyowned land 
rightly viewed by pipeline opponents as blatant exploitation of native americans  as well as a violation of an  treaty with the us government  standing rock sioux water protectors and supporters have camped along the missouri for months in an effort to halt construction as a lawsuit languishes in federal court 
big oil big banks  and government backers obviously view future profiteering from the pipeline important enough to send in absurdly militarized police from at least five states to combat pipeline opponents  who have remained on the whole peaceful prayerful and unarmed 
etp insists the opposition is misguided and dakota access offers a safe alternative to the riskier oil transportation methods of railroad and tanker truck  but even the companys own records listing thousands of spills in just the last six years flatly dispute such claims worse although pipeline leaks and spills might technically be less frequent than those caused by railroad accidents the international energy agency notes pipeline mishaps leaked three times more crude over an eightyear period 
in fact big oils general safety record is nearly impossible to fully track in part because such spills leaks explosions and other accidents are startlingly common and no less perilous to workers residents the environment  and yes the rapidly dwindling water supply 
a report by the center for effective government attempting to map and quantify crude and other industry spills found not only are ruptures and leaks a daily occurrence but eighty people have died and  have been injured in such incidents in the last five years 
since  over  incidents of crude oil and liquefied natural gas leaks or ruptures have occurred on us pipelines these incidents have killed  people injured  more and cost  billion in damages they also released toxic polluting chemicals in local soil waterways and air 
according to the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration as noted in the report  those spills and ruptures sent  million gallons of crude into the environment further illustrating the imperative to oppose construction of dakota access one of the worst spills occurred in north dakota  not by human error or poor maintenance  but when lightning struck a crude oil pipeline spilling  gallons of crude into a wheat field in  
while the oil and gas industry and its wealthy proponents in government would attempt to pull the wool over the publics eyes about pipeline safety using crafty language and skewed statistics the truth is no safe manner for transporting oil and gas actually exists 
opposition to the dakota access pipeline simply isnt confined to a native american issue as exploitive as that facet is  but when pipelines traverse pristine lands farm acreage and the rivers and waterways we depend on to sustain us were all at risk 
what scant corporate media coverage of the standing rock sioux tribes stand against big oil does exist has painted the fight as limited in scope but thousands encamped along the pipelines planned route  who face an unusually bitter winter  no less  are in fact taking a stand for every person and every creature who would be devastated in the event of a future oil spill share",2016-11-19

wikileaks is helping president obama keep his  campaign promise  to be the most transparent administration in us history  whether he likes it or not and once again were learning more about the inner sanctum of the administration and its communication practices as fbi director james comey announced friday a new investigation into hillary clintons email scandal has been launched just days before the presidential election comeys move drew fire instantly from the democrats who claim comey is attempting to sway the election in donald trumps favor while many are focused on comeys actions and renewed investigation wikileaks has uncovered what may prove to be a systemic problem of executive branch accountability not merely limited to the former secretary of states emails 
according to former state department official tom nides in a  email to john podesta clinton campaign manager everyone in obamas cabinet and every white house staffer uses their personal email for government business nides should know as he worked under hillary clinton in the state department from  to  according to one source  
while keeping email hidden from the public may seem like no big deal to folks who simply dont care all correspondence which is related to governmental business is the property of the federal government and is supposed to be accessible by anyone wishing to inquire within the archive of records 
the federal records act defines a record as anything regardless of whether it exists in physical digital or electronic form is a record as defined in subsection a shall be binding on all federal agencies this includes all communication of state agents like the potus who work in the executive branch of government as well 
but the obama administration according to nides has long since avoided the federal records act by using private gmail accounts nides wrote podesta and said there is only one thing that needs to be done on this email thing which i am sure nobody wants to do get a state dept career lawyer to go through all the emails and pull the official ones that admission seems to be on the level with what is expected for compliance with the federal records act but it was nides next admission which is the talk of many major media outlets 
nides wrote btw you know as well as i every god damn cabinet officer and wh staff uses their sic gmail account the former department of state employee revealed what many already suspected the obama administration is anything but transparent just ask tom fitton president of judicial watch his organization routinely sues the obama administration in federal court using the freedom of information act as warrant for inquiry and says the administration stonewalls his efforts at every turn fittons organization gave the obama administration a failing grade on transparency and says his administration is even less transparent than when bush was president 
fitton wrote in   there are about  lawsuits  of which are active in federal court and about  judicial watch foia requests that could be affected by mrs clinton and her staffs use of secret email accounts to conduct official government business in our various foia lawsuits our lawyers have informed attorneys for the obama administration that hillary clintons account and any other secret accounts used by state employees should be secured recovered and searched jw actively seeks out those files through official methods using foia and the federal records act but has been met with delay after delay from foia requests to the obama administration 
while the obama administration is on its way out groups like judicial watch arent going anywhere and presumably have all the time in the world to foia their way into digging up those deleted clinton emails as well as securing gmail accounts from the obama administration cabinet and staffers this story is definitely a long way from being over 
its no wonder why so many free thinkers are now questioning the story lines theyre being told with the president and all his men and women hiding their communications within their gmail accounts the truth is never going to be told at least not the real truth and by the time organizations like judicial watch are successful in obtaining the electronic communications records that rightly belong to the people it will be way too late to hold anyone accountable for breaking both the federal records act and the freedom of information act julian assange we salute you thank you for forcing the obama administration to be transparent keep up the valiant work share",2016-11-19

brinkley ar  dashcam video showing preferential treatment of an arkansas police chief has him scrambling to defend himself for being let off easy  without so much as a warning  after speeding to an offduty job as a referee at a football game 
footage obtained by thv from arkansas state police following a viewer tip shows brinkley police chief edward randle being pulled over in his personal vehicle a red pickup truck near clarendon on friday october  
a state trooper assisted an officer from the brinkley force upon request and makes a uturn after witnessing the speeding red pickup driving in the opposite direction to make the stop 
as the trooper approaches the drivers side dashcam video shows he immediately recognized the brinkley chief of police and laughingly asks where are you going so fast 
randle  obviously familiar to the state trooper  isnt asked to produce identification and tells the officer hes headed for the game which he later clarified for thv was the clarendonmarvell football game 
at that point the brinkley officer who had summoned state police for assistance with the stop also approaches randle  as the trooper tells the chief the officer had been tailing him for miles when he finally called for assistance 
i know you didnt call the state police randle quips to the brinkley officer 
i didnt have your plate the officer replies so it didnt go over 
as thv posits that statement could indicate that since the officer did not announce the trucks license plate number into his radio nobody else would know the chief had been pulled over 
the trio laughs about the chiefs excessive speed and the officer tells him i had you locked in at  
it wont do  itll only do  randle responds referring to a governor capping his trucks speed as he later explained to thv in an unrecorded interview 
after a few more laughs the officer tells randle he measured the trucks speed over  miles an hour  and the chief was still pulling away at the time 
despite the obvious dangers of such high speeds on the narrow curvy road both the trooper and brinkley officer simply walk away from the truck as the officer says dismissively see you later chief 
video captures the last exchange between the two cops as randle pulls away  the state trooper notes he clocked the chief doing  at the curve 
in two phone interviews with thv  which were not recorded by request  randle disputes he ever came close to the trucks alleged top possible speed of  as well as the troopers claim in dashcam footage he had been rounding the curve at  mph 
additionally though the state trooper claimed that the officer had been pursuing randle for miles randle told thv that the officer was on his way to clarendon to get fingerprints from someone at the county jail 
thv spoke with local business owner benjamin martin who first noticed the stop by a brinkley officer inside clarendon city limits 
i find it you know very disheartening that anyone public official or not would show such blatant disregard for the speed limit and put the lives of innocent others at risk martin told the station in a video interview 
i just feel that no ones above the law and you know if it was me i wouldve gotten a ticket 
indeed the public might be lucky the offduty brinkley police chief didnt lose control of his vehicle while traveling at such a high rate of speed  simply to make it to a football game 
neither the brinkley officer nor the state trooper are being investigated for wrongdoing  despite giving the chief a free pass arkansas state police told thv the incident fell under control of the brinkley police department as soon as the officer arrived on scene even though the trooper affected the stop 
as a chief of police and as a law enforcement officer youre sworn to protect and serve martin asserted which is the opposite of putting the lives of others at risk 
although nothing serious resulted from randles excessive speeds it was notorious blue privilege that allowed him to drive away without even a warning 
these seemingly small favors afforded to police by police on a constant basis highlight the divide civilians feel in their encounters with law enforcement indeed the idea police belong to an exclusive club of impunity  simply because of their chosen occupation  only increases tension and resentment in their communities 
if police dont uphold and enforce the laws they enforce against civilians the law becomes an arbitrary exploitive method for generating revenue  and nothing more share social trending",2016-11-20

denver co  a denver cop has been arrested and suspended without pay after his own body camera footage caught him stealing  in cash from a crash victim 
instead of helping an unconscious crash victim officer julian archuleta took advantage of the situation for his own personal gain by going through the mans clothing and robbing him archuleta now faces charges of misdemeanor theft stdegree official misconduct and tampering with physical evidence 
according to an arrest affidavit archuleta responded to a call of shots fired in the early morning hours of october  the call then led to a short pursuit which ended as the car crashed the driver got away while the passenger of the vehicle was knocked unconscious 
archuletas body camera then recorded the officer for the next  minutes and  seconds in the footage he took pictures of the scene and then searched the mans clothing which had been removed by paramedics 
in the video archuleta finds a stack of cash in the mans pants with a  bill on top according to the arrest affidavit he then separates the  bill from the stack and a  bill remains on top 
throughout the footage archuleta shuffles money and rearranges paperwork in his patrol car the affidavit said 
according to the denver post when a detective collected the cash and logged it into the property bureau as evidence he counted  and did not find any  bills the affidavit said but while reviewing archuletas body camera footage as part of the investigation the detective noticed the  bill 
amazingly enough instead of covering up the theft the detective crossed the thin blue line and reported the inconsistency with the  bill to internal affairs when confronted by investigators archuleta told them he would check his war bag to see if any of the money had slipped into a crevice in his patrol car 
according to the arrest affidavit archuleta called the detective back an hour later and claimed he found   bills that must have fallen in his bag after being caught redhanded archuleta then turned in the money 
according to the post the denver district attorneys office declined to prosecute the shooting suspect because of the missing cash and because archuleta allegedly moved evidence inside the suspects vehicle before detectives had a search warrant the affidavit said 
earlier this year the denver police department was equipped with body cameras we now know why it took so long for the department to adopt them archuleta will now go down in history as the first denver cop to be criminally charged based on body camera evidence 
like most cases of police theft this incident is not isolated in fact just  months ago grants police department sgt roshern c mckinney  was arrested after an investigation found that hed stolen both money and marijuana from the police department like archuleta he entire theft was captured on the officers own body camera mckinney has since been charged with marijuana distribution conspiracy and felony embezzlement 
state police also charged mckinneys yearold girlfriend tanicka gallegosgonzales for drug distribution and conspiracy both were arrested in albuquerque and booked into the sandoval county detention center according to kob 
public information officer for the new mexico state police elizabeth armijo said grants police chief craig vandiver alerted state police after the department found video from mckinneys lapel camera that exposed possible illicit activity by a grants police department sergeant

kadzik in fact maintains a cozy enough relationship with podesta to have had dinner with the clinton insider just one day after the former secretary of state testified before the house select committee on benghazi last october 
and the pairs familiarity isnt held to a simple dinner party as the daily caller reported  podesta and kadzik the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show in one email from january kadzik and podesta who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign 
so kadzik  an extremely close friend to the chair of hillary clintons presidential campaign  is tasked with heading the newly reopened investigation of hillary clinton 
clinton couldnt ask for an arrangement better situated to again find insufficient evidence worthy of bringing charges against her as far as conflicts of interest go this takes the cake 
the political appointees in the obama administration especially in the department of justice appear to be very partisan in nature and i dont think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust matthew whitaker told the daily caller  
if political wranglings and connections marred transparency and neutrality the first time around it would be reasonable to assume the players havent since magically unentangled themselves from clinton and her campaign mere days before americans take to the polls 
its the kind of thing the american people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of hillary clinton whitaker continued also noting the controversial meeting between bill clinton and attorney general loretta lynch on an airport tarmac in phoenix during the dojs previous investigation 
in fact kadzik as an obama appointee to the justice department beginning in  also initiated the effort to have loretta lynch appointed to the role of attorney general 
and the friendship between kadzik and podesta  as well as their connections to the obama administration and additional officials overseeing the clinton investigation  spans decades 
in  for example as the washington free beacon reported from one of the leaked emails podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik have a supportive role in obamas presidential campaign  particularly because the latter was a fantastic lawyer who managed to keep podesta out of jail 
although kadzik as head of the office of legislative affairs does not have a direct role in chain of command for the clinton investigation he does field inquiries from congress concerning her emails 
noted by the daily caller  in november he denied a request from republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation which sparked outrage by the gop over potential conflicts of interest 
florida rep ron desantis voiced particular concerns about lynchs longtime connections to the clintons in a february   letter  and that obamas appointees are being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as department of justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the democratic nomination for president of the united states 
while the daily caller s report goes much further in depth concerning the relationships of podesta and kadzik with the clintons and their insiders it can be easily surmised in even a simple perusal of facts there could be no possible way an investigation this critical  and with resounding implications  would maintain any semblance of impartiality 
when julian assange vociferously denounces the us electoral and political systems as rigged beyond repair these connections are precisely what hes referring to 
it might calm an irate public to hear an investigation had to be reopened  but when the effort involves the same players as the first round the outcome is alltoo predictable share social trending",2016-11-20
589,comment on why you should become a minimalist by how effective are books on fitness,"home  be the change  government corruption  prominent psychologist says google has power to control elections can shift millions of votes to clinton prominent psychologist says google has power to control elections can shift millions of votes to clinton the free thought project november    comment 
rt  people trust the unbiased internet search giant google so much it can actually influence up to  million undecided voters to choose hillary clinton for president prominent us psychologist and author robert epstein told rt following years of research 
despite being a supporter of the democratic presidential nominee dr epstein believes googles unchecked algorithm of placing one candidate over the other in search results constitutes a threat to democracy 
rt robert how did you discover that google is possibly in cahoots with the clinton campaign 
re well i didnt find out that they were necessarily supporting hillary clinton thats not what i found at first first through several years of research i found that they had the power to control elections the power to shift the votes so that was more than four years of experimental research with more than  people in  countries 
so we established through some very careful experiments that by favoring one candidate in search rankings google can shift a lot of votes more than  percent of undecided voters overall and in some demographic groups up to  percent of undecided voters people trust search rankings so much that if one candidate is favored in search rankings that shifts peoples votes 
now more recently many people have established that google has a very close relationship with hillary clinton that didnt come from my research that came from all kinds of investigative research by many people 
rt are you going to take a look at facebook and twitter as well it looks like social media play an even bigger role in the elections than televised debates 
re well we know now that facebook has the power to shift about  votes to hillary clinton on election day with no one knowing this is occurring all they have to do is send out go out and vote reminders to hillary clintons supporters but not to trumps supporters that would cause a lot of people to vote who would otherwise stay home so yes weve looked at facebook weve looked at twitter but again facebook can shift  votes google can shift somewhere between  and  million votes 
rt have you been able to find abnormal search results by google in some other countries intended to influence the outcome of elections 
re we havent look carefully at too many countries weve looked at the uk election in  we looked at the national election in india at the lok sabha election in  what we do know is that it is the nature of googles algorithm to put one candidate ahead of another that happens automatically that happens as google would say organically so this means that googles algorithm has probably been determining the outcomes of close elections around the world for many years probably actually controlling the winner in as many as  percent of the national elections of the world 
rt what do you think about this threat of big data do you think google and other search engines analyses all search results by an individual for a good purpose 
re well big data at the moment is a threat its a threat to democracy at least as we have it in the united states its a threat to human freedom its a threat to civil liberties this is mainly because the technologies are very new and new means of control of surveillance of manipulation are being developed which at the moment are not regulated  theyre not covered by any laws or regulations so the problem is that these technologies have developed quickly and we have not developed systems for monitoring these technologies weve not developed systems for regulating these technologies obviously we must do so 
rt youve said that unlike europe russia and china were able to overcome the google monopoly but a lot of people are still using this search engine do you think that the us company can manipulate public opinion in russia as well 
re well its hard for them to manipulate opinion if they dont dominate that country google dominates most of the countries in the world the only countries it doesnt dominate are russia and china so russia and china are protected a little bit from google but russia and china have their own problems russia has yandex china has baidu and these companies can use techniques just as the ones that google is using and perhaps theyre already using these techniques these techniques can be used by any big tech company that provides a search engine these techniques can be used by any big tech company that provides search suggestions 
my newest research shows for example that google seems to be favoring hillary clinton in its search suggestions the suggestions it gives you when you first start to type an item and from new research ive done we know that if you suppress negative search suggestions from one candidate that shifts votes and opinions towards that candidate so google is not the only problem any of these big tech companies can use these techniques for surveillance for manipulation for control and i think we have to be concerned about the big tech industries in general around the world not just google 
rt how do you oppose such great power being wielded by one corporation like google 
re well the problem with a lot of power being in the hands of one company is that the private company is not answerable to the public the private company does not have people who we voted on the private company might be run almost like a monarchy with the ceo having enormous power and the public having no say whatsoever in what they do even not having access to their internal records so we would have no idea of exactly what theyre doing or how theyre doing it and how theyre making decisions this is potentially very dangerous the situation right now is unprecedented in human history there has never been so much power placed in the hands of so few people who are beyond the reach of any laws beyond the reach of any regulations and who dont necessarily have the public interest in mind 
rt what about donald trump in your opinion what methods and tricks has donald trump and his loyal media used in this presidential race 
re well ive said in writing repeatedly and in many interviews that im a very strong supporter of hillary clinton hillary clinton is by far the better candidate donald trump is a very weak candidate he would not make a good leader he would not make a good president plus i know people in his family it makes no sense to me that he is even running for president i dont think he wants to be president i think he just wants to increase his celebrity so that he can start his own television network and i think that steps are now already being taken for him to do that 
the private company might be run almost like a monarchy with the ceo having enormous power and the public having no say whatsoever in what they do even not having access to their internal records so we would have no idea of exactly what theyre doing or how theyre doing it and how theyre making decisions this is potentially very dangerous 
i made a prediction on twitter recently you can check this i not only have predicted that he will set up his own television network but that he will launch his network with a guaranteed hit show it will be a reality tv show about donald trump running for president and that will be a hit show so i think thats his only interest here hillary clinton will become our next president its guaranteed and in my opinion donald trump has no interest never had any interest in becoming president 
rt do you believe that hillary clinton will become us president through the manipulation of public opinion 
re oh hillary clinton is guaranteed to win this election and i have said previously based on polls that seem to show a kind of a close vote that those polls did not take into account the power that google and other companies have to shift votes thats missing from these polls so once you realize the power that these companies have hillary clinton is absolutely guaranteed to win and she will win in the margin of somewhere between  million and  million votes if we take the mean the average of those two numbers i guess you could say its pretty clear that she will win by approximately  million votes 
rt given that the united states has such an expensive and powerful media industry would you say that voters in the us have a real picture of the presidential campaign 
re well voters in the united states i think do get a pretty good picture because we have so many different kinds of media and people are just bombarded with information from newspapers magazines and the internet more than  different television channels so i think we do get a pretty complex and deep picture of things but you have to remember that all of these forms of media are competitive so were getting one perspective from one magazine another perspective from another magazine 
but when you come to something like google theres no competition theres no competitor its a completely different kind of influence its noncompetitive in other words if youre still trying to make up your mind and you go to google and ask a question about the candidates or about some sort of issue related to the election google will show you whatever it wants to show you and that can easily easily tip your opinion one way or the other and theres no competitor theres no way for anyone to compensate what google just told you 
so this is a completely new and very dangerous kind of influence it has no competition theres no corrective for it and people trust google  we know this from surveys  people trust google more than they trust any newspaper any magazine or any television station people trust information that they get from a computer much more than information theyre getting from television or a newspaper because they know that television and newspapers are biased because they know that people are actually giving them the information but when they get information out of a computer they mistakenly believe that that information is impartial that information is objective and of course thats not really true but thats what people believe",2016-11-20

washington dc  in what could prove to be the proverbial nail in the coffin of hillary clintons presidential ambitions an email released by wikileaks this morning  the th batch of emails from clinton campaign chair john podesta  reveals potential criminal intent to violate a court order for subpoenaed documents 
john podesta sent the message only hours after the new york times reported that clinton might have violated federal records requirements by using the server according to the latest batch of podesta emails released by wikileaks 
the email in question  sent by podesta on march   reveals the clinton campaign chair directing cheryl mills hillarys attorney and chief of staff to destroy emails that had already been subpoenaed 
the email exchange between podesta and mills came suspiciously on the same day that news broke regarding clintons use of a private email server 
after news of clintons private email server became public podesta wrote to mills not to sound like lanny but we are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later podesta told mills mills responded think you just got your new nick name 
it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out exactly what podesta meant by dump the emails when taking into account the fact that this was transpiring just as news of the private server was breaking what this email does is provide insight into the coverup process  and exposes a willful intent to break the law additionally it reveals exactly how swiftly the clinton camp moved to obscure the truth from both investigators and the public alike 
according to a report by the new york post  
in december  hillary clinton  now the democratic presidential nominee  turned over about  pages of workrelated email to the state department but that fact wasnt revealed until the times reported on her use of the private server 
on march    a week after the podestamills exchange  clinton addressed the email scandal and announced she had deleted about  personal emails 
the emails reference to lanny is likely in reference to lawyer lanny davis who served as special counsel to thenpresident bill clinton as well as spokesperson for the president and the white house on matters regarding campaignfinance investigations and other legal issues 
interestingly zero hedge reports that a search for lanny davis reveals a suspicious exchange between clinton campaign manager robby mook and podesta from march   just days after the above mentioned exchange in which mook tells podesta 
we gotta zap lanny out of our universe cant believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on tv 
hillarys team was apparently upset that bill clintons special counsel was engaging in a transparent course of action and moved to zap lanny out of our universe 
while it isnt clearly spelled out exactly which emails podesta is referring to in his email the fact that he wrote better do so sooner than later on the day news broke publicly regarding clintons email server strongly indicates that the actions were a responsive measure meant to obscure any investigation into the matter 
clintons entire narrative regarding her private email server has seemingly unraveled and her methodical plan to strategically impede the state departmentfbi investigation by deleting the evidence is now on full display for the public to see 
hopefully wikileaks next upcoming podesta email dumps can provide even further context to this already damning email of course hillarys spin doctors are hard at work thinking up a new narrative to work around this latest revelation regarding the willful attempt by clintons team to usurp a federal investigation

asheville nc  a video posted to facebook this week has the internet in an uproar as it shows an asheville police officer allegedly assaulting a yearold girl 
the video shows a short interaction between yearold kacee fleming and officer shalin oza according to cherrell mooney the woman who took the video fleming approached police as they were arresting her brother dominic fore according to apd they had a warrant for fores arrest 
she was asking them why are yall arresting my brother mooney said the officer was being rude they didnt want to talk to them 
the video apparently shows the aftermath of this questioning as the officer grabs fleming and throws her to the ground 
according to police fleming yelled at officers and allegedly reached into her brothers pockets to retrieve his personal items as he was being arrested flemings actions then caused officers to have to deal with her the video is the result of fleming apparently being dealt with 
according to police fleming was arrested and charged as an adult for resisting obstructing or delaying an officer sgt noland brown who was on the scene also told news  that she is charged with misdemeanor assault on a government official 
i have no trust in the police anymore said crystal fleming  kasees mother according to news  she says her daughter was trying to communicate with police before the incident to tell them that fore had just gotten out of the icu 
she is not trying to be disrespectful said crystal fleming but yall are not listening they were not listening 
you wonder why people are running around here saying black lives matter she continues thats why because they really dont think our lives matter because he could have pulled her to the side talked to her he didnt even do none of that 
according to police they were there for another incident but when they saw fore they decided to arrest him too

ooooh the adrenaline rush that brave heroic cop must have enjoyed after overpowering that dangerous villainous little girl he can proudly puff his chest out after that one nishi 
the disturbing thing is that they actually do that they feel good about doing this kind of thing they are convinced that what they are doing is morally just and necessary reminds me of hobbesto this war of every man against every man this also is consequent that nothing can be unjust the notions of right and wrong justice and injustice have there no place where there is no common power there is no law where no law no injustice force and fraud are in war the two cardinal virtues jonathan sabo 
this is not about black  it is about getting involved in a legal arrest  razedbywolvs 
no its about black because if it wasnt white people might get pissed enough to do something about it that would not work out to well for the officers involved in legal arrests james michael 
she had every right to require he state why he was being arrested and the officer had no lawful arrest she also had every right to free the man from being kidnapped by a traitor you retard 
now why was he being arrested bruismenot 
what a lovely mouth that mother has no wonder the kid has no respect for the law also it looks like the kid was resisting including standingsteppingstomping on the cops left foot oh well gininitaly 
i looked at that video  times and never saw her stomp on his precious foot she was  and hardly lbs soaking wet youre telling me that a big adult male couldnt contain her threat without shoving her to the ground bruismenot 
unfortunately cops arent psychic and they have to react quickly to protect themselves the girl was obviously highly emotional when she approached the situation one of the most dangerous times to interfere with police activity is during the arrest of a family member 
its easy to sit back and criticize the cop but he doesnt know her intent nor if in the dim light shes carrying a weapon of some sort you cant just go stomping up on an arrest situation ignoring orders to stay back 
have you ever fought an emotionally charged  year old girl they fight like wild cats just watch a video on you tube some time if you havent age doesnt always matter and  year olds are adult sized 
cops dont put on the uniform to get hurt teach your children to respect the law show respect yourself and you wont have to worry about adult sized teenagers being thrown down by big mean cops 
also maybe your device is better than mine but it looks to me like the girls foot lands on his left foot i could be wrong in that ill look at it again gininitaly 
hogwash spoken like a cop of today who needs an excuse to brutalize for profit or the pleasure of being a bully against the defenseless 
lumberjacks farmers emts firemen and fishermen have more dangerous jobs than cops and i happen to be old enough to see my towns  years of service police chief retire without ever having fired a shot at a human being and that was  yrs of drunks with guns broken bottles or knives belligerent mouthy kids family disputes and all the rest so whats the difference between then and now his talent and yours attitude and the desire to deescalate situations not intensify them to the point of murder 
since  and the patriot act they seem to have been given permission to make us citizens their victims instead of their friends family and neighbors that they were once supposed to protect and serve 
you will get no get out of jail free or pity cards from me cops today or rather whats left after the good cops get fed up and quit or were drummed off the force because those that remain are drunk on their own power over people and revel in the violence that they create 
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxfaif_a_e bruismenot 
i didnt say the cop did a great job i didnt say that i would have reacted the same way i didnt say that i thought the video looked fine i was simply trying to give an explanation for what we saw on the video gininitaly 
and just who gave you that job or why you thought that cop needed defending you invented an aggression by that  yr old complained about language defended the cop no matter what the video actually showed and projected your prejudices onto the entire situation in my book that makes you a worthless witness who deals in fantasy not fact no different than a lot of chicken chit americans who think defending the police or government will get you a free ticket off of the auschwitz express you should never defend the indefensible 
all it takes for evil to prevail is for a few good men to do nothing bruismenot 
i take it we cant be friends then stir up the sjws all day long if you must who does anyone call if they get jacked shot stabbed or whatever next time you are the victim of a real crime go ahead and call those same sjws to save your bacon see how many show up and how far you get 
lady dont assume you know me you dont know my story if you didwe might could be friends gininitaly 
i have no idea what a sjw is is that police jargon i know one thing i wouldnt be calling an american cop theyd end up shooting my dog my kid or me if they even managed to make it to the right address in some steroid induced adrenaline rush i dont need those kinds of jacked up people in my life youtheyve lost all credibility as anything that could or would help id ask a bystander for assistance before calling a cop any day 
your words are quite indicative of where your loyalties lie and if you think im assuming then you should come clean and tell your story and at that point i might reevaluate my take on who you are and why you seem to need to defend the indefensible in what used to be the formerly free usa 
httpkilledbypolicenet free_willey 
your explanation is bogus and it clearly indicates that you are the problem the cop should have been arrested on the spot for assault this is what makes all cops criminals they fail to arrest and charge crimes against their buddies in blue you included it astounds me that you guys continue to make your job on a daily basis more and more dangerous putrid ignorance and arrogance and a complete non caring attitude for people in general is what is on display at todays pds this is not the service that we hired you for cops work an entire lifetime to avoid disdain for the people they have sworn to serve only to have pds hire the lowest of iq and then train them to see the public as the enemy once you start to justify the violent actions of todays cops you need to leave the force furthermore you do not have to be a psychic as you claim to see that the cop simply became upset lost control and used violence to assault this less than  lb person bruismenot 
sure arrest all the cops then whose going to keep all the people safe who dont have or know how to defend themselves from the predators in the world

our youth need to be taught that they are not able to do whatever they want they need to understand that laws apply to them and if not followed prepare for consequences 
the point of no return that i see in this video is a  year old female that feels she has the right to interfere in an arrest in progress

you have the right and the duty to stop any sworn servant unlawfully arresting someonethat is an act called aggravated kidnapping and is an act of treason stopkingobama 
you have the right to resist an unlawful arrest they had a warrant for her idiot brothers arrest even resisting an unlawful arrest is a good way to get killed let them cuff you and if they were acting as egregiously as you think they were tell it to the judge if you have video to support your probably unfounded claim all the better

buffalo ny  in their relentless and often violent pursuit to control what citizens can and cannot put in their bodies the state leaves behind a trail of blood and suffering as the buffalo police department illustrated last week this trail often contains the blood of defenseless animals 
police incompetence coupled with deadly training came to a head last week and wreaked havoc on the residents of buffalo the narcotics division of the buffalo police department executed a series of drug raids last week leading to a handful of arrests and the seizure of small quantities of drugs  mostly cannabis 
after the department released their heroic numbers to the press on how much dangerous cannabis was taken off the streets they remained conveniently silent about the dogs they slaughtered along the way 
on friday morning buffalo cops in their search for a  lb  black male raided the home of michael urban  a   lb white male 
while police were ramming the innocent mans face into his kitchen floor urban pleaded with them not to kill his dog but it was to no avail 
police took aim at the helpless dog who according to urban was simply standing there in a nonthreatening manner boom one officer fired but the bullet only injured urbans monthold pit bull named gotham sending him running away frightened and crying 
as the dog is wailing in agony another officer fires a round directly into the dogs skull exploding the innocent animals head but it gets worse 
urban lives on the second floor of an apartment when the second officer shot that bullet went through the floor and almost killed the tenant downstairs 
what just happened urban recalls as the bullet hole went through the floor through the ceiling as the dogs blood is dripping through the downstairs apartment whos accountable 
as gothams blood drips from the bullet hole in urbans floor and out of the hole of jami krafchaks ceiling in the apartment below cops decided to go after her too 
after they nearly killed her cops raided krafchaks home she was manhandled searched with no warrant and humiliated as she stood there in her nightgown 
neither urban nor krafchak were charged with a crime 
the night before the heroic cops of the buffalo narcotics division killed an innocent mans beloved pet they raided the home of cory and cindy meer 
according to meers lawyer matthew albert  meer and his twoyearold son watched helplessly as jackboots murdered their beloved family dog damian a sixyearold pit bull 
meer tells artvoice that his dog was not a threat to officers he is the most family friendly dog ive ever had hes never hurt anyone said meer he would have licked the cops 
just like urban meer lied face down as he begged the cops not to shoot damian again this was to no avail 
as meers yearold watched in horror a cop blasted the family dog to death 
my son lost his best friend right in front of him meer said 
also like urban meer was not arrested however a friend at his house allegedly had a small amount of marijuana on him so the raid was justified according to police 
according to meers attorney he has  active cases of dogs being killed by the same squad 
they are going to say they are going after dangerous drug dealers albert said out of the cases i have theyve hit the wrong houses numerous times  found nothing numerous times and i think at best theyve found a few pills at one of these houses charges i got dismissed because they were filed wrong 
in  the free thought project reported on a freedom of information act request for use of force incidents within the buffalo police department the information was shocking 
according to use of force reports buffalo police shot  dogs from jan   through sept  seventythree of those dogs died nineteen survived 
to provide a comparison buffalos numbers more than triple the amount of dog shooting incidents involving police in cincinnati a municipality of similar size 
the numbers are what the numbers are buffalo police chief of detectives dennis richards said in an interview with wgrz in  certainly no officer takes any satisfaction in having to dispatch a dog 
apparently however they do it is not like buffalo residents have more dogs than other parts of the country this department seemingly takes satisfaction in killing peoples dogs 
when asked if the buffalo police have undergone any special training in regards to dealing with dogs or the handling of dogs in a nonlethal manner chief richards said it has not come to that point in buffalo that weve implemented any of those other techniques 
apparently killing a dog every other week or two in a hour period is just dandy and they see no problem with it or reason to seek out training to deal with such a high rate of puppycide 
something has to be done however and it is far more than just training the most effective action that would need to be taken would be to drastically reduce the instance of noknock search warrants according to an aclu report  percent of swat raids are searches for drugs 
if we want to end puppycide we have to end the drug war  the two are not mutually exclusive matt agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world follow mattagorist share google  cousinscootie 
adam arroyo still waiting for justice from a  killing of his dog on a wrong address raid wtf are the judges in buffalo doing handing out noknock search warrants for refer with the track record of buffalo narcotics 
noknock search warrants this is the real crime 
the words search warrant cant even apply in these cases its more like an execution warrant 
the only acceptable cause to conduct a raid especially on a civilian residence is if there is a hostage situation 
no hostage no raid common sense 
so a bunch of steroid junkies have to miss out on playing war games with civilian lives well too bad we can call that an acceptable loss mike 
i hope and pray that everyone of these thug cops that shot dogs get shot themselves and left to bleed out in the gutter like the trash they truly are gordon klock 
they clearly get some nonadmitted sense of satisfaction by killing peoples pets in front of them  we all are coming to know that there is absolutely no reasoning with these sadistic clowns the war on drugs has always been a scam to generate prison labor  terrorize the populace whilst maintaining the naive illusion that it is all somehow morally responsible behavior to harm  incarcerate people over such an exaggerated threat more likely to oneself if at all  they really seem to enjoy scaring the helpless as they commit these acts of brutality that wouldve been illegal for them to do three or four decades ago katz ro

593,reasons why you should try photography as a hobby,"home  badge abuse  parents on a date were asleep in car when cops arrived and killed them both parents on a date were asleep in car when cops arrived and killed them both matt agorist february    comments 
inglewood ca  on sunday police responded to a call of a suspicious vehicle parked on manchester boulevard around  am when police arrived they engaged in a minute long standoff before opening fire on the man and woman inside the vehicle killing them both 
in the news release on monday following the shooting police claimed that the woman in the car had a gun scott collins a spokesman for the inglewood police department said that the couple refused to obey the officers commands to exit the vehicle the officers then feared for their safety and opened fire on the car  killing the couple 
the woman was pronounced dead shortly after the shooting and the man succumbed to his injuries after paramedics transported him to a local hospital according to the la times 
the shooting seemed like an open and shut case until the next day mayor james butts while responding to questions about the shooting opened up a huge can of worms  both the man and the woman were unconscious 
for at least  minutes police attempted to rouse them in an effort to deescalate the situation said butts 
after admitting that the couple was asleep butts quickly defended the officers noting obviously at some point they were conscious because somebody felt threatened 
however that notion has yet to be proven and is particularly unlikely due to the fact that not a single officer received so much as a scratch nor did the couple have any reason to be violent 
both of the victims were parents kisha michael  a single mother of three sons and marquintan sandlin  a single father of four daughters 
michaels twin sister trisha stated the obvious when she said that its possible that kisha merely passed out on the way home from their night out 
families for both described them as devoted parents who made arrangements for care of their children while they took a night off according to nbc los angeles 
the police aint telling us nothing said trisha michael after being met with tight lips from the department 
he was a loving father said sandlins sister leandra faulkner all he cared about was his girls getting them right 
of course as is standard procedure for all those killed by police their arrest records were released to shame them michael was on probation for a misdemeanor last year and  years ago sandlin was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm in los angeles 
according to his relatives sandlin had a rough life but had turned it around and was working as a successful truck driver 
sadly these children will now grow up knowing that their parents were taken from them by cops scared of a sleeping couple share google  concerned citizen 
perhaps the mother had the gun on her lap for protection while they slept at least they didnt drive drunk these parents did not deserve to die mary hagerty 
did she really have a gun or did the cops just say that to excuse the murders of two sleeping people lying about weapons is a known police tactic to get out of trouble sometimes they go as far as to plant a weapon conscious 
lets say they had a gun how did the police see it if they were asleep hmmm that makes it irrelevant john and linda robel 
who gives a fuck about driving drunk it is determined by an arbitrary number that is extorted by the united states congresswe encourage people everyday to annul this police statist horseshit a felony can be expunged but not a fucking misdomeanor dui get a grip this nothing but a government racket and proffiteering of the dui industry kevin burnett

marie laveaux  im not disagreeing with you i just always like to see some real info before i jump to conclusions not just a headline i have no idea what happened and will not put blame on either side unless i see some hard evidence julie asperger 
on los angeles local news report they said the vehicle was stopped in the middle of manchester blvd not parked on the side of the road both are illegal seemed strange the way it was presented to us this makes it even weirder i passed by and seen there is a large memorial for them to bad there is no video to see what really happened 
cops dont like being filmed 
for obvious reasons julie asperger 
yea i was harassed by some a few years back on hollywood blvd and intimidated into deleting video of them using excessive force on cooperating men i even showed them my press id and tried to be allowed to keep the video they said fuck the press kimberly reichard emerson

as long as bureaucrats are allowed to hire with little or no supervision those who seek to be employed as cops many of whom have a history of being bullies going back through their childhood and who seek this means of furthering their bullying lust now armed with impressive uniform shiny new badge and deadly weapons and with the presumptions that they now have a license to beat cripple and shoot when ever and whom ever they please atrocities are expected to be the norm and will be expected to grow at an exponential rate it is forever hoped that one or more law firms will come into being that will relentlessly undertake the filing of suits and not only agains the involved jurisdiction and the individual rogue cop or cops but those who were involved in the hiring of the cop or cops the impression always being that these who are responsible for the hiring and thus are as guilty as the involved rogue cops  they have to be faced with the harsh reality by having levied against each and every offender hugh awardsfines not just on the jurisdiction ie the city county state or feds    but also against each of the individual involved in their being hirsd    as well as the rogue cop or cops themselves as individuals the awards to be paid by the individuals by their prorated award share payment out of their own pockets and only a prorated share by the jurisdiction as what the jurisdiction pays will invariably come out of the pockets of that jurisdictions tax payers stiff penalties in the form of huge financial judgement awards should go a long long way in fostering an awareness by these who have escaped accountability for so so long of the potentially very expensive folly of this their irresponsible actions which results in so much suffering and many time crippling injury andor death mary hagerty 
i agree but please dont use all caps to write its way harder to read roberto carlos moscoso 
sadly the government insists that they want to take guns away from civilians for only police officers have training and are responsible enough to handle guns yet ive seen more mass shootings and innocent people dying in the hands of cops than in the hands of irresponsible citizens crazy ah tracy walling otis 
is that true marco emilio giovanni maltese thats truly horrifying if so if you have a source of those statistics i would appreciate the link for it i know its bad im not denying that but i am even more disgusted if it is that bad  
ive read that cops killed more than  people in the usa in the last  years but im sorry i dont have the link you can search and you will find it easily i think usa people should be more scared of cops than of terrorists alain vosselman

the fact that there are enough of these stories coming from america for several to be posted everyday proves how messed up the place is i would not want to be a black person living in america today i wouldnt live there at all nothing will happen to the officers they should be sentenced for murder and receive a full sentence police officers over there intruding on peoples property and killing pets killing people just walking down the street or washing their car id i was an american the only reason id want to own a gun was to defend my self against police officers ryan robbins 
you shouldnt believe everything you are reading online its bad right now but its not nearly as bad as many are making it out to be all of these innocent victims are not nearly as innocent as they are initially made out to be when the truth finally comes out on most of these stories its on page  and nobody takes the time to post it because it does not fuel there agenda to spread hate and prejudice aaron beedle 
it is true everyone has agendas im sure there are a lot of people in general dying in america but i know from life that the people with the power are usually the assholes i would say that at least  of all male human beings struggle to handle power reasonably females would be close too when it is appointed rather than earned such as when someone is called a police officer and given a weapon that can kill people with ease people tend to not handle it well i heard a while ago that some parts of the world do not use equipment they would not fire at themselves and they are made to it teaches people restraint christopher rawson 
the police across america are being demonized by a sickness in the system that wants to put us against one another that human is a human none of us our without fault or live life without ever feeling in over our headpossibly there is another way tim walker 
i suppose if everyone voted for that one independentlibertarian candidate then maybe we would have a fighting chance sadly that will never happen the vast majority of people have been brainwashed by the two main parties with the division they have created they can easily put in any candidate they choose how can anyone prove that it wasnt predetermined 
i just watched a news video of this story the mayor said the couple were passed out when police arrived police spent  minutes trying to rouse them and deescalate the situation how is there a situation to deescalate if they are passed out ?? ???? 
ryan said nowhere in his comment that they deserved what happened all he said was that another source had different information if another source has clashing info of course one of them is going to be wrong no need to bash him vanessa white 
some groups must be trying to start to a race conflict and some are just happy with anarchy i would never call them for anything they dont seem to know who or when to shoot or maybe they are all amped up on steroids all the time pitiful i will keep the children in prayer blue thugs 
all cops are cowards never seen one that wasnt a coward and bully one of the cops got tired of waiting and said gun that was all the excuse they needed to open fire what if that was a white couple with a gun in the carnearly everyone has a gun on person or in the car these days what if they have a permit or concealed carry permit do you fucking think the cops would have fired  rounds into that car and killed the white couple well do you if one of the thug cops did holler gun no one can ever say anything to contradict them cops know if only one side is left alive no one can say otherwise better to be judged by  than carried by  that is every cops motto as they know they are above the laws for mere mortal humans linda brown 
chickenshit bullies this bs has to stop i belive all you say as i have been targeted in canada first nations peopledrunk  drive teens and pot smokers are all targets where i live every skin color fair game on last two for sure these peace officers should be heald accountable face an open hearing  open to public   a fair trial  and then deal with courts decision im not sure if this happened to my friends it would not end in graveyard these murders must face charges and hopefully murder one usn veteran

arizona state constitutional provision  article  section  
the right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself or the state shall not be impaired but nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing individuals or corporations to organize maintain or employ an armed body of men 
arizona respects the right of all us citizens to carry a concealed handgun with or without a permit or to carry openly while in this state an arizona resident permit can be obtained for the purposes of carrying concealed while in other states that offer recognition or reciprocity 
castle doctrine enacted right to carry confidentiality provisions enacted right to carry in restaurants legal right to carry laws no permit required right to carry reciprocity and recognition outright recognition right to keep  bear arms state constitutional provisions with provisions 
as such arizona has fewer crimes per capita committed with a firearm as does california how does extrapolate these facts perhaps as arizonians have come to accept firearms as a know factor in their daily lives whereas californians do not perhaps californias draconian laws encroach upon human mental health whereby inhibiting residents of the state of california to live in fear rather than confidence 
i for one shall leave this contemptuous state seeking solitude of which only a truly free society can bring i shall make arizona my final resting place i expect in this forum environment there may be egregious comments to the final resting place  
i respect all of my fellow american citizens and their constitutional right to express their opinions as protected by the united states constitutional first amendment

department of justice has statistics on police killings and being white doesnt make you immune in fact more whites were killed by police than blacks in the last  years doesnt excuse this horrible murder of an innocent couple but please dont fall prey to deluded thinking that being white makes a difference look for yourself

fuck you dude my dad is a good cop and i judge his actions too you are biased im not and leave ppl alone they never bother with flat tires so fuck off chris cochran 
every single one of these cops needs to be charged with murder and the police need to pay to make those kids end up having a good life since they will never have their parents to give them one gary harryman 
yes every cop at that scene is guilty of the same crime since they acted as a gang they should stand trial as a gang and all be charged with the same crime  murder terri spanjer 
i wish people would stop and think for a minute about how the government is allowing police to murder citizens and that over the last  years these incidents are occurring a hundred times a year its all part of the big plan to remove all your rights and terrify you  ps  yes  was an inside job think

black lives are being slaughtered even in their sleep and we sit and watch idol 
i learned at a young age the country will only change when its forced to black people need to stand up we are not shooting practice and we will raid stores court rooms and banks in the s or s if money and property is all they care about 
more may die but we all die eventually and will die sooner if we watch idol this is the world you want to live and raise your kids in really 
this is not hate talk but black lives matter marches and speeches should be the calm before the storm if they continue to kill us and our children in our sleep i dont think talking should be our last effort how many more will die 
it wont theyre killing everyone now desiree m mondesir

i wouldnt compare rural life with inner city life at all rural people respect each other they help each other the police are neighbors you can explain inner city hell to yourself ?? ?????? 
in  the police in usa murdered  black people and  white people total killed of all was  
so far in  the police in usa murdered  black people and  white people total killed so far as of february  is  
but more whites than blacks you say simple only black lives matter to the main stream media their mission is to promote an agenda to put us common folk against one another also imagine if us whites acted like blacks when we have one of our own killed by police when are whites going to loot and riot thomas headen iii 
you riot when your sports teams lose or win for that matter percentages sir say that black men are  times more likely to be killed by police than white men i think if the percentage were reversed you would be alarmed as well god bless michael mcmaster 
to put it in perspective if police were shooting people in a colourblind fashion then youd expect that for every  people shot  of them would be black and  would be white or to put it another way left handed people are about  of the population if it turned out that year after year they were  of the people killed by police it would be fair to ask why they were being singled out disproportionally anna black 
whites loot and riot during sports the real question is where is the all lives matter when this happens daniel robins one yahoocom

wow i didnt know things were this bad  it just seems that being black is so wrong anymore why do these things keep happening i just ask that all cops and law enforcement be mindful of what they are doing and double check their situation before over reacting now kids are without parents this is ridiculous bless the babies and their parents lincoln kirby

show me the video dksman 
wtf this article is full of major inaccuracies they werent parked on the side of the road they were in the middle of a major street right in front of an intersection they didnt pull over and go to sleep all you have to do is loom at the crime scene photos and see this article is full of false information they had a gun on them as well catherine durnfordwang 
so for that they deserve to be shot and they had a gun so what again arent guns allowed under the second amendment zatanique 
how does a sleeping couple put anybody into a state of fear for their lives i smell a cover up of monumental proportions by the cops involved i cant believe that they could possibly find a plausible reason to justify opening fire on these two people not only do i want to see a special grand jury called to deal with these cops police department and city i want to see a wrongful death suit brought against them the police department and the city because of these cops  children are without their parents no amount of money is going to make that better or make up for what they did 
on what planet could you possibly justify what happened smh for real 
i cannot even grasp this if they were not conscious why didnt they try to make sure they were not suffering from co poisoning oh no lets just shoot them and make up any story we like huh david sbraga

these cops need to stop it so were suppose to believe that this woman and this man with  children between them are in a car that late at night just waiting to threaten cops with a gun were really suppose to believe that story i dont understand how cops can be so afraid when they have a license to carry a gun training on top of that a partner and access to call for backup i just dont get it if youre that afraid of a black person on sight then you dont need to be a police officer you need to seek help last time i checked it was black people getting killed by the police and not the other way around yeah the cops have a handful of tragedies but it cannot compare to the numbers when you talk about deaths of blacks by police not by a longshot im getting really tired of this and the whole usa needs to revamp its law enforcement system you can give guns to cops who are suppose to protect and serve but where is the protection for the rest of us jeff putterman",2016-11-21

as a mix blood american any time i hear someone in the black community use the n word in any way or form i hear and see ignorance when i hear someone outside the black community use it i see nothing less than a disease spreading it is a term that should be nothing less than unacceptable no other racial group uses derogatory terminology to describe themselves using the excuse that you are taking control of it is a bullshit juvenile excuse jay 
thanks for the comment my nigga guy 
although i am not hispanic i understand the slang pretty well and have employed many over the years  
you would be surprised at the what comes out of there mouths about blacks and whites including thouse who come from other countries in south america as well there feelings and attitudes of anyone they consider different in appearance  
we as the white race dont have anywhere near the market cornered as to racial predigest and racism in general just ask the jews or palestinians about that  
we just understand it more from our own little perspective of the world around us but it is prevalent all over no matter where you happen to be at or from  mr 
she said the in n word on facebook bet she dont have the guts to say it in person further more for every white racist that call blacks n word that dont offend us you wanna know y u dont have to be black to be call a n word we as black people use it to insult our ancestors then we think its cool for whites to say it truth be told white people are niggas also u wanna know why well look the word up and u will see we are not niggas we are negros nigga or niggas is jus another word for stupid dumb and ignorance so look at u now who the nigga now um damn shame for a fucked up world guy 
so what do you consider a white honkey or cracker to be  considering i was one who watched the original archie bunker and gladys shows and thought they were great i never liked gov wallace and thought what the cops did in selma alabama and little rock was just wrong  i have always believed mr king was right while thinking that sharpton and jackson are in it just for the money and political opportunities and believe the the blm has done some good but has been hijacked by out side influence that sees political gain to be won on the behalf of hillary who i think will absolutely destroy the intercitys by keeping herself and her kind in power over the backs of african americans and others she deems deporables  mr 
im not racist im jus stating facts why whites get mad when they came out with black lives matters  then they say they are thugs an terrorist how so when whites rally up and sit at the store and everywhere else with a bunch of bikers but they tell the blacks oh they in a bike club shitting me half of them kkk if not all police is the biggest gang of america they get mad cause we sale drugs truth be told the police the one putting drugs on the streets we dont own boats plans for that matter to go get drugs at the end of the day the world is jus fucked up period mr 
further more fuck jessie jackson im from greenville to he aint did shit for that community beside rebuild his old apt complex and added his name on where was he when the police killed my friend in fountain inn sc an took him back to the jail after the fact he was dam near dead then tried to say he hung himself where the justice for that guy 
mr just about every black man woman and child in n s carolina knows that justice lives in the bottom of every toilet in every jail in just about every southern state in the south that the white cracker shits in and calls it truth  
now we as the whites have learned to refine the obvous racism that still exist to the point of having a black president to make it look legit for the world to see  
what do you suppose president putin sees when he shakes hands with obama just a man or a black man  
personally i belive that racism is part of the our genetic make up considering man has been making slaves for many thousands of years out of all races including white and black  
i just dont act upon my inherited prejudice nor choose to pass it on to my children 
i think that is what makes the difference realizing its there but choosing not to act on the difference is what separates me from the others who just make lip service to there ingrained predigest while knowing full well they dont believe a word that comes out of there mouths  
when i see you i see a black man who is just as frail or strong as i am wanting the same as i do in life and just asking for the chance to work for it  
if on the other hand if you are a white or black thug or punk gang banger it dosent matter you will be treated as such  mr 
you right i never said u was wrong one time we both are human we both have and opinion at the end u see things your way i see things my way i know u not racist u know im not racist but at the end of the day can u say u can live in a black community with u jus being the only white people in the neighborhood check this my home paid for own my land also tell me y a police sit by my yard asking me  bout the white guy in my yard and then start to as random do u think its right with out the proper cause guy 
no i dont think i want to live were you do considering i am too damn old and set in my ways to want to besides i dont think my wife is going to want to move quite yet  my oldest son moved to alaska a few years ago with his wife and dogs and they enjoy it a lot both got good jobs and doing well even bought a house on a acre of land for about half of what you would pay for one around one here in the san francisco bay area 
brentwood was once know as a red necked farming town of about  people when i was a kid growing up here my family have been farming for generations the hispanics were our hired labors living in labor camps and the blacks were shown the city limit lines by the police  
my mom was considered progressive and we had a black nanny named pearly live with us for many years durring the summers while mom ran the ranch i loved her much she was a good woman as wide as she was tall would read to me and my sister and made incredible apple pies i first meet her when i was  living in richmond ca to when we moved here in the mid s into the house my mom built that i still live in today pearlys children came to my sisters wedding 
now brentwood is a city of  i dont recognise it any longer but its core is still farming there are black families living on my street in houses built where there were once orchards and going to the schools i did i have a family i would consider white trailer trash living in the house next door that once had garden tour buses come to see the yard and have tea parties  
my attitude is people are people i really dont give a damn who you are be respectful of me and keep up your home and property to show your pride in ownership and you should expect the same from me  we can be friends and neighbors sharing a beer at a barbecue i throw on july th and at christmas and go fishing once in a while in my bass boat  
as to the other thing you mentioned i think about cops being randomly nosey asking about me because i was the white guy sitting in your yard in a all black neighborhood  what fucking business is it of his  if he asked me i would politely tell him to go f off and then shut the hell up f he pushed it there would be complaints filed against him the next day and perhaps speeking to his chief and maybe the city counsel as well depending on the situation  its not a good idea to piss me off cause i not only get mad i get even too  mr 
get mad about what thats childish to get mad cause we voice our opinion my dad married to a white women my uncle married to a white women im white a women an u know what we bout to get married my neighbor are not bad i dont stay in a violent neighborhood everyone stay on my road is family members at the end of the day i ask do u think the police was right for asking me  in my yard im  i know right from wrong also guy 
i am a little confused which is not hard to do 
i think you are asking me if it was okay that the cops who had stopped outside of your yard ask you over and question you about some white guy who was in your yard visiting with you  correct  
if that is right  then my answer is no  hell no  unless the guy is a known gangster with a rap sheet a mile long  and even then there are ways and means for the cops to go about there business to conduct there investigations with out asking people about theres thats why the detectives make the big bucks to covertly investigate with out shooting off the alarm bells  
for some local flat foot to come up to you on your own property and start pumping you for information with out any justifiable cause is against your constatutional rights illegal immoral and he can go take a flying leap off a short bridge  
i know its done all the time and cops seem to have every excuse in the book to want to try it 
but my point is simply to smile at him tell him to have a nice day and walk away you dont ow him a thing if he still wants to push it then tell him you dont have to talk to him unless your lawyer is present  that will usually set them running  
i see too many stories about people getting into all sorts of trouble because they start flapping there gums thinking they are cool and just digging an even deeper hole for themselves to fall in 
cops know from training how to push our buttons and rely on our own stupidity to sink our boat as the results  mr 
yes he did i was asking u do u think he was in the right guy 
damn dude  i was afraid you were going to tell me that this actually happened to you  
it totally freaks me that it could and would but dosent really surprise me anymore that it does considering that many citys had stop  frisk on the books untill only recently  but supposedly it has been done away with according to the courts recent rulings fat chance of that really happening cops will just come up with a new way of doing there thing of harassing people for there fishing for a crime scene 
i am sorry that it has and wish i could do something to stop it  knowing that because of the color of my skin is probably the only reason why it doesnt or hasnt to me  except when i was a kid living in berkeley ca then i got hassled by the cops quite a bit because of the hair down to my butt they all thought i was a drugged out hippy which a lot of the time was true i got slammed around by them quite a bit shot at and gassed a few times then arrested and served time in jail and probation for things that now are not considered a crime anymore  for some of the crap i use to do and the people i ran with i am lucky to be still breathing

hey  at least you are still alive and hopefully clean and sober with a family that loves you  that is a lot more than some of the people you knew when you were running the streets ill bet consider yourself mr to be blessed  
never a father figure in my life just a strong willed old fashioned no nonsense mom who drove her father into oakland from brentwood everyday at the age of  in  she introduced me to the ymca in oakland when i was  took a lot of backpacking trips with them to the bottom of the grand canyon to visit the havasupai indians that lived there hiked all over california montana yellowstone yosemite and europe backpacking and hiking should be a mandatory class in hs especially to intercity kids who never get out and see the real world except concrete pavement and maybe a city park  
i understand why you did what you did you will receive no condemnation from me for it  some of the people i ran with were totally vicious animals to the point of wondering if they were at all human or not  hells angels and there buds were some i knew and partied with in the late s while living on telegraph ave in berkeley even ran into some original black panthers along the way now thouse guys were freaky and strange always talking about revolution and wanting to blow white people up  
what saved me was getting the hell out of there moving to a small town in the mountains finishing my college education there later meeting a good woman who put up with my bs and marrying her we have been together  years produced two fine sons that are a joy to us i became a small business man as owner operator of a landscape contracting company for  years first working for retail and wholesale nurseries and other landscape companies to gain experience never went into farming with the family my brother was the one who did that with my mom my sister has her life with her husband  years but to say i was born with dirt under my fingernails and will probably die that way is close to the truth sometimes i rather talk to plants than people because its easer that way and they dont give me grief like people do 
hey  if you want to shoot me an email sometime i am not against it i can be reached at email protected after all this is a open and public forum and maybe you are not all that comfortable as the result suit yourself mr 
im still alive cause god showed me awaywhere i didnt have to hold people for ransom or in a drug trade shoot out all the time he made me realize i was only making memories in the streetsbut ill never think ill live to tell a lot of people who didnt know me my life style jus feel like before some of the whites judge us blacks they should actually look at the community we lived in if we lived in a drug neighborhood it wasnt by choice thats for damn sure we adapted to the fine cars clothes and everything that came with it only thing about it a small price came with also guy 
good to hear now what are you doing  mr 
doing father dutys guy 
so what s that for you  what line of work are you in how many rug rats you got running around your wife work or is she a stay at home mom  whats the town or city like you live in  got any hobbies or are you sports nuts 
just curious is all sure its none of my busies and mean no offence or none taken if you dont want to talk guy 
i hope your education dose not reflect the way you write but if it dose god help us all because you are the next generation and inheritors of what has been left to you so you can build onto it for the betterment of the future generations  your children and there childrens children  to come  mr 
as long as i graduated from high school im happy long as my job allow me to bring him  to  every two weeks im happy my education aint got nothing to with how i shorten my word like everyone else in life i be willing to bet i go to a interview and talk jus like the white people and come out with a job didnt know education had to do with the problems thats going on in the world all my kids straight a students what about your kids are they me speaking my thoughts and opinions dont have nothing do with how i write im not in school anymore i feel i shouldnt have to prove shit to no one but my self and my kids guy 
of course you are a proud father and well you should be dont we all as parents want and expect our children to be better than we were  i think that is only natural 
my sons both graduated from collage and are set in there lives both in there early s one married and living in alaska working as a city planner and the other is still here at home finishing up his education cheaper that way 
there mother and i dint get past a two year community collage degree with me going into business as a landscape contractor  years 
you are right your education has nothing to do with any of the crap that occurring you dont have anything to prove to me and your thoughts and opinions are just that yours alone and who the hell am i to criticise  
mr you talk the way you want and feel comfortable in and i will just listen and offer commentary once in awhile if its okay with you mr 
i like listening to older people it makes me more wiser an not dumb like some american u only have wisdom from being wise hugh culliton 
call me premillennial but i find it baffling that anyone regardless of where they think itll go would lack the judgement to realize that creating a permanent record of such potentially personally damaging actions is a terribly stupid thing to do 
in addition to unprofessional conduct she should also have been fired for such criminal idiocy guy 
i dont agree at all  or perhaps it comes from your firm belief that you have never done something dumb rash or saying something that would be considered even remotely offencive by someone else  hmmm  hugh culliton 
on the contrary  its precisely because i know that ive done and said dumb things and that the recording of such things makes them vulnerable to being hacked that i find it baffling that one would want such personal  and completely normal  incidents of lack of judgement permanently recorded online 
we live in the world of total online or even onnetworkedcomputer collection of data as a high school teacher i deal with this every time i teach teens internet safety thats why i see it as being a generational trend by people whove grown up with their entire lives on line such an environment means that while on the upside we can out trolls racist leos and nasty pedophiles it also means that everyone need to be very very careful with all data and information they store online 
however in this case we have someone  not acting as a private citizen  but as a uniformed representative of the state  in a time of very tense relations between law enforcement and the public taking personal images of a highly offensive nature mistake or not  its out there and this action still betrays a serious lack of the judgement expected from a law enforcement officer guy 
she and everyone else who speaks in public  
trump has been made keenly aware of that fact as the results of what he said  yrs ago is now coming back to bite him as well clinton  
thanks for taking the time to further explain your point and now that you have i tend to agree with you although i still believe that the treatment to this young and naive lady was harsh  
but considering she works in a public tax supported office its to be expected to bad she dint have the common sense to see it  hill billy",2016-11-22
595,how we can win the propaganda war,"home  be the change  nsa whistleblower nsa has all of clintons deleted emails fbi can access them any time nsa whistleblower nsa has all of clintons deleted emails fbi can access them any time jay syrmopoulos august    comments 
washington dc  one of the architects of the national security agencys surveillance programs dropped a bombshell over the weekend when he stated that the nsa has all of hillary clintons deleted emails he also noted that the fbi has the technical and legal ability to gain access to them if they chose to do so 
william binney is a former highly respected nsa official that served the agency for over  years helping to create its surveillance program  before becoming a famed whistleblower upon resigning in  on sunday he declared in a radio interview broadcast that the hack of the dnc could have been coordinated by someone inside the us intelligence community angry over clintons compromise of national security data with her email use 
appearing on sunday on aaron klein investigative radio and speaking as an intelligence analyst binney questioned whether the hack of the democratic national committees servers were actually the work of russian hackers as the clinton camp has alleged instead he raised the possibility that it was actually the work of disgruntled us intelligence officials upset about clinton being given a pass on criminal charges after compromising national security secrets through her use of unsecure personal email servers that were undoubtedly accessed by numerous foreign intelligence services 
during his interview with reporter aaron klein binney referenced thenfbi director robert s muellers testimony in march  before the senate judiciary committee in which mueller spoke of the fbis ability to access a number of secretive databases to track down known and suspected terrorists 
now what he mueller is talking about is going into the nsa database which is shown of course in the edward snowden material released which shows a direct access into the nsa database by the fbi and the cia which there is no oversight of by the way so that means that nsa and a number of agencies in the us government also have those emails binney said so if the fbi really wanted them they can go into that database and get them right now binney stated in regards to the missing clinton emails 
when klein asked whether he believed the nsa has copies of all of clintons emails including the deleted correspondence binney replied with a oneword bombshell yes  he responded that would be my point they have them all and the fbi can get them right there 
according to a report by breitbart  
and the other point is that hillary according to an article published by the observer in march of this year has a problem with nsa because she compromised gamma material now that is the most sensitive material at nsa and so there were a number of nsa officials complaining to the press or to the people who wrote the article that she did that she lifted the material that was in her emails directly out of gamma reporting that is a direct compromise of the most sensitive material at the nsa so shes got a real problem there so there are many people who have problems with what she has done in the past so i dont necessarily look at the russians as the only ones who got into those emails 
the observer defined the gamma classification 
gamma compartment which is an nsa handling caveat that is applied to extraordinarily sensitive information for instance decrypted conversations between top foreign leadership as this was 
how interesting to think about the distinct possibility that the hacked and leaked emails are not the result of russian hackers but actually came to wikileaks from an unknown crusader at the nsa itself  another snowden if you will 
let us hope that after for years of watching clinton expose national security secrets through reckless handling of highly classified intelligence some determined patriots within the intelligence community are now working to see the downfall of clintons by exposing their corrupt political apparatus likely we will never know as zero hedge reported  it is the nsa that has been tasked with determining if the russian government is behind the hacks one thing we already know is that when an agency investigates itself it never finds itself responsible share",2016-11-22
596,stockholms feminist snow removal program causes the entire city to shut down,"home  badge abuse  leaked soros memo reveals potential plan to use black lives matter to federalize us police leaked soros memo reveals potential plan to use black lives matter to federalize us police matt agorist august    comments 
memos and documents published by dcleaks continue shedding light on billionaire globalist george soros and his progressive organization open society foundations osf due to their poor digital curation however the leaks are hard to comb through which is leading to the information slowly trickling out the latest of the documents reveals the billionaires attempt to organize a national movement to create a federalized police force 
the document shows that osf saw the killings of mike brown eric garner walter scott and freddie gray as an opportunity to implement this mission of federal police guidelines osf according to the documents then held a meeting titled police reform how to take advantage of the crisis of the moment and drive longterm institutional change in policecommunity practice 
the memo further documents that sorosfinanced groups and personalities influenced a task force on st century policing created by president obama last may the task force released a final report consisting of  recommendations recommending protocol to local departments on how to modify policing practices 
the information is from a page report of an open society us programs board meeting that took place in new york city in may of last year 
states the board meeting document 
the federal government is seeking philanthropic support for a number of its initiatives in addition to seeking support to advance the implementation of the recommendations of the presidential taskforce the white house recently launched the policing data initiative to explore how best to use data and technology to build trust voice and solutions to improve community policing the department of justice recently selected the first six cities to host pilot sites for the national initiative for building community trust and justice which was launched last fall to help repair and strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve by exploring strategies intended to enhance procedural justice reduce implicit bias and support racial reconciliation 
we are gaining a better understanding of these efforts in order to determine how best usp can use this moment to create a national movement we have already had a set of preliminary conversations with about a dozen key stakeholders and will undertake a field scan to map the areas of work currently underway to advance police reform including an assessment of the redundancies and gaps in work and opportunities for collaboration as we proceed we will engage the funder network we helped to establish the executive alliance on men and boys of color which now includes forty foundations 
us programs usp is a part of osf with the stated mission of working to further a vibrant democratic society in which all people can meaningfully participate in its civic economic and political life 
according to the above excerpt usp was thinking of ways to capitalize on police killings to create a national movement to implement their agenda 
the think tank also raises the question of how to properly steer the ostensible grassroots organizations such as black lives matter to achieve usp goals 
the events of the past several months have understandably led to a wide range of activities including a variety of advocacy efforts to respond to the significant challenges in policing that have been exposed and the opportunity to promote meaningful and lasting change for example organized under the banner of the civil rights coalition on police reform organizations like the lawyers committee for civil rights under the law lcchr and ldf are advocating for federal reform efforts with a particular emphasis on data collection and transparency and as noted above  effecting federal funding streams a variety of other national advocacy organizations including grantees advancement project policylink the center for popular democracy and the aclu are working to provide advocates with toolkits and resources to help their organizing efforts locally based groups such as the ohio student association the organization for black struggle the asian law caucus and the aclu of new jersey to name a few are advocating for specific reforms at the city and state levels another layer of grassroots and youthoriented groups like freedom side ferguson action black lives matter and million hoodies movement for justice are also advocating for specific reforms the range of efforts underway raises a number of questions and concerns about capacity the need for coordination and the appropriate prioritization of policy objectives among others which we will discuss in the policing portion of the meeting 
while the intentions of reforming police in america seem noble the very idea of a sorosled initiative is chilling 
another memo leaked earlier this month showed the billionaire was potentially funding the black lives matter movement  to the tune of  now as todays memo shows we know why 
as the free thought project has pointed out many times before soros has been exposed literally manipulating the world 
earlier this month in an email found within the wikileaks hillary clinton archive with the subject unrest in albania soros makes clear to clinton that two things need to be done urgently he then directs the secretary of state to bring the full weight of the international community to bear on prime minister berisha and appoint a senior european official as mediator revealing the influence he wields within the corridors of power soros then provides secretary of state clinton with three names from which to choose unsurprisingly clinton acquiesced and chose one of the officials recommended by soros  miroslav lajcak 
this is standard operating procedure for soros anyone familiar with the history of the soros open society foundations in eastern europe and around the world since the late s will know that his supposedly philanthropic democracybuilding projects in poland russia or ukraine in the s allowed soros the businessman to literally plunder the former communist countries wealth according to the new eastern outlook  
sorosaffiliated organizations are deeply connected to numerous color revolutions such as the arab spring and a number of other uprisings across the world they have been intimately involved in the coup that took place in ukraine and subsequent ratcheting up of cold war tensions with russia 
as these leaked memos and emails prove the united states is nothing more than one of soros pawns 
while americans remain oblivious and argue over straw men fed to them by the mainstream media the police state is growing  both here and abroad as the citizens are promised reform the only thing that actually changes are the puppets in marble buildings matt agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world a classtwitterfollowbutton hrefhttpstwittercommattagorist datashowcountfalse datasizelargefollow mattagorist on twittera and now on a hrefhttpssteemitcom share google  real truth stings 
i think its time to end local policing for profit the police force should exist to protect and serve not to fill the county coffers we need direct oversight of the police the end of the power of their union to protect bad cops and the end of corrupt local government the downside is the federal government is so big and spread out that they can barely keep track of our military assets we can count on them to institute a public facing qualifications search for candidates randy pitts 
do you really not understand that what you just said is exactly what this article is exposing 
soros has indoctrinated you fools into favoring a federal police real truth stings 
do you have a better idea we have localized corruption in every state if you have another way to achieve this feel free to discuss it billdeserthills

you arent looking at the upsides that are possible billdeserthills 
because there are no upsides except for upside yo head when those even stupider federalized cops hit you pto 
replace local corruption with centralized corruption at least now some places arent corrupt billdeserthills

are you one of those crazies that doesnt believe official fbi documents i figured you would of been trigged by the brainwashing comment but you skipped right over it and pointed at one the few non jews in hollywood as the problem you have to have a short list for that especially since rosie odonnell hasnt been relevant for  years if ever my tin foil hat is itching the immigrant absorption ministry i think your idf httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoyuoguvb az patriot

mr prince when he gets robbed assaulted in anyway he wants to call razedbywolvs to help him because no one else will get real the constitution states that the states should govern themselves not let the government do it nishi 
i have never been so naive as to think that smart and engaged people refrained from brainstorming solutions together according to their shared beliefs nor have i ever thought that would be a good idea cole 
tell this so called journalist that he cant complain about soros trying to change the direction of our police force before it turns into a police state then at the end of the article try himself to tell us we need to be on the watchout for a police state shusei 
right there is no evil plan in these memos i dont know much about soros if he is evil guy or good guy but least i can say is this article is bs and many people in here have no ability to read understand and think prince 
somebody really needs to put a bullet in soros head despicable rem certified 
dont leave out his son greg geitner 
now its easy to see why soros was paying them to act out ricialove 
as a black woman heres what i want to knowwith all that money that blm receiveswhat the heck do they do anna miller 
george soros is a criminal subversive who has created havoc on a global level and for a long time his crimes are welldocumented he is the billonaire who broke the british pound in  he is responsible for funding numerous revolutions including the coup in ukraine toppling a democratically elected president and moving nato closer to russian borders and funding ngos who were not really charities but subversive infiltrators he is an evil man have you noticed how many billonaire jews are involved in all kinds of evil financial schemes and or hold such high positions in both neoliberal as well as neocon both sides of the fencegovernment positions although they only make up  of the populace why hasnt this criminal been arrested his aim is to deliberately stir up a race war the police are attacking people of all colors and ages yet blm seems to defend black men who were in truth guilty at least they could pick a black man or woman who was actually innocent why doesnt black lives matter defend blacks who have been murdered by other blacks which is usually the case or dont those black lives matter and how about the  of black children born to single mothers with no father in the home often to siblings from multiple fathers these children often grow up to be street thugs the facts bear this out blacks do commit most of the crime in the us and commit more crimes against whites as well the issue should be on the increasing police brutality on all citizens not only focused on black lives the police target them more because blacks commit most of the crime does the truth enter this equation blm detracts from the entire populace of all races focusing together on increased police brutality against the public at large for soros and those who want to increase antiwhite sentiment and race tensions blm is mission accomplished the bastard soros should have been arrested a long time ago and imprisoned and not in one of those cushy hotel prisons either and one can only wonder who is really running this nation when soros remains unfettered dan 
maybe just maybe hitler saw something that the rest of the world still can not see or simply refuses to see az patriot 
what are you saying all jews should have been sent to the gas chamber so that soros wouldnt be around  dan 
oh right your one of those kinds of people huh next you are going to tell me that they really did make lampshades and soap out of jews huh az patriot 
if i were you i wouldnt continue to show your ignorance insensitivity and anti jew sentiment go away dan 
im ignorant bwahahah heres an easy one for ya whats  minus   carolyn 
idiot must run in your family carolyn 
dan you are an atheist who wants the world to believe that hitler did not slaughter millions of jews go to the holocaust museums filled with the pictures and tools the nazis used to experiment on the children pictures taken by the american soldiers when they entered into the prisons so go into a hellnory site and w her with your crap dan 
so explain to me how they had to change the plaque at auschwitz in the s from claiming  million died there to only just over  million and its now believed that its not even  million that died there 
and you dare to call me the idiot keep googling im sure you can find it carolyn 
i did not call you an idiot but i should have auschwitz was only one of many concentration and death camps you check it out dan 
wow you have shown your level of stupid on  levels in the one post good work but i digress ad hominems like yours only exist to show your own lack of a reasonable argument 
auschwitz was well known to have been by far the largest concentration camp during ww with the greatest population compared to all other camps it even boasted a swimming pool inside the camp for its population how do they just lose  million deaths from that camp if auschwitz could not accomodate  million deaths but only closer to  million how did the other much smaller camps process more deaths than alschwitz 
now here is hte real kicker from back in  jews were already claiming the  million  decades into the future its in the damn newspapers and you can freely search and find them for yourself 
care to explain how that happened jew magic i guess httpsuploadsdisquscdncomimagesefadbaaaeddfeefdeedfffebacfbfjpg carolyn 
dan did you read any of the small incomplete articles evidently not m was quoted to show that russia and other countries had that many jews nothing about death these prior years to  were expressing the plight of how the jewish people were being treated now auschwitz was not the only camp that slaughtered jews now does that sign specifically say that auschwitz deaths were just auschwitz murders your damn newspapers need to be read by you before you put that smudge attitude in writing dan 
wow your brain really is broken huh you cant see the connection between claiming the magical  million prophecy which is actually about claiming the heartland in  and using that same exact figure in the lies about ww the same lies that the nazis also made lampshades and soap out of jews 
auschwitz plaque was obviously blatantly lying just like the lampshades and soap myths once the soviets were forced to give up the ledgers iirc in the s it was obvious that they could no longer sustain the lie that  million were killed there and were forced to bring that number down to about  million are you really that stupid that you can not see the pattern here 
there is a hell of a lot more but i get the feeling that im talking to someone to stupid to even grasp the basics 
fun fact anne frank never wrote anne franks diary otto bought the story from another novelist and changed it to reflect his daughter there was even a recent copyright case where they are now claiming that he was the author fun times carolyn 
oh i see your pattern believe that crap instead of what the pictures written accounts by the liberation armies and you did not answer my question on the articles you want to point to that does not say m jews died did you pull all of the articles and read the whole story i would bet you did not you are a typical atheist marxist democrat you can pound your chest again when you check history and find out that the democraps started the kkk group and were the biggest slave owners you people amaze me how you put crap out there that you can not back up kind of like your loving candidate hellnory dan 
show me a single picture of gassed jews or even of the gas chambers themselves or even the several thousand dead jews they would have to have piled up waiting for their several hours in the crematorium it actually took back then to cremate even a single body or you mean i am meant to take the word of the proven lying jews who to this day like in the video i linked above have clung to their fantasies even after they have been busted lying 
as for the liberating armies you do recall that all the gas chambers were in ruins when they came through and there was zero evidence besides the lamp shades and soap of any jew holocaust that account you mean 
and of course it dosnt say that  million died yet only that they were in peril etc but you dont find it a mighty large coincidence you also obviously have no idea how they came up with the  million at the end of ww do you go find out where that number came from the person who made it up even claimed it was completely symbolic and not to be taken literally 
you are a typical atheist marxist democrat and in the face of clear defeat out with the mindless ad hominem once again a clear indicator that you are way outside of your depth you are incorrect on all  counts once again do you ever get anything right 
were the biggest slave owners guess who the biggest slave owners were fucking jews hahaha they owned all the slave ships and were behind every facet of the trade 
kind of like your loving candidate hellnory and thats the funniest go find my twitter feed its full of anti hillary sentiment in fact its the only reason i really began using twitter was during this election cycle to keep track of whats going on because i refuse to engage in the corrupt leftist media once again mostly jew owned for fear of turning into a brainless zombie like yourself 
ill give you this tho you certainly are persistent in your stupidity its no wonder you cant see anything thats going on around you in this world dan 
here is a great classic you really should watch about his explaining away his lies as not really lies httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjswiomiak carolyn 
you really have a real talent referencing things dan 
yea this is how you learn things you take a fairytale lets use santa as an example and you work out when your like  years old how can there be  santas in the same place why are my presents always in the bottom of my parents wardrobe a week before santa apparently brings them to you a week later and slowly you deduce that there is no santa clause and its just a lie that you have been fed while your brain is all still mushy 
or you know you can just blindly have faith that there is still a santa you know like you do even in the face of such a mountain of evidence carolyn 
you need to stop your atheistic info because you do not know what you are talking about m jews killed in all of the auschwitz camps did you know that there were  large camps with  large crematoriums no you did not that is just a drop in the bucket places that murdered experimented on starved gased and shooting of jews k hungary k poland k france k netherlands k greece k boheman  moravia k slovakia k belgium k yugoslavia k itally  norway and k from other countries k jews k poles k gypsies k soviet prisoners k czecks yugoslavs french germans did you know that hitler had built  camps death camps concentration camps holding camps gas camp vans labor camps and detention camps many jews died in ghettos on trains during the death march to evade the oncoming of the russian army and us forces these camps were set up in france russia germany poland and austria one of the camps berkenau killed  thousand jews per day in total m jews killed in killing centers and  jews shot gased experimented on now how do you explain your decision to not believe these totals dan 
of course i knew i obviously know more about the subject than you do like you i came from a place of believing the lies until i started questioning some of the facts i was taught and the advent of the internet and survivors videos where they constantly get busted telling lies made me reconsider the truth about ww 
actually current scholars beleive its somewhere between k and i think its k it might be k died in all of auschwitz while i do not doubt that there was some experimenting america was doing the same thing but on its own people at the time the great majority were simply natural attrition in a time of war considering the allies were bombing supply lines constantly yet never the camps themselves because they also knew they were not death camps in fact lets invoke the story of the holocaust poster child again anne frank if they were really gassing people in some huge manner why would they even keep around a weak sickly girl long enough for her to die from typhus 
and yes of course many people died many of them jews thats what happens when you have wars none of this supports gassing or mass extermination of jews stupid 
but my final question is how do you blindly believe the word of people who have been shown on many occasions to be liars specially in the face of so much verifiable evidence to the contrary ie the lampshades soap diesel gassing vans eye witness stories that completely contradict everything etc specially knowing the fact that many jews chose to escape with their german captors rather than await the soviet armys rescue carolyn 
of course you did not know any of the information i wrote if you profess that you know how many died then go on the holocaust site and you will see that after they checked the records that the germans kept you do know they tattooed the jews to make sure what numbers were dead or alive how would i know why they kept anne franks till she died of typhus they very cruel people the jews were at war with the nazi germans what the hell are you talking about if you go on the site you will see pictures of the gas chambers and crematories what the hell else do you want why dont you go to auschwitz and see for yourself you are so bigoted and i believe you are a lousy democrap despicable rem certified 
hitler has the rothschild and other bank roll him while killing off the poor and middle class jews who hardly dominate their own street block let alone the world as a true socialist he had the pragmatic double standards so many on the left have today az patriot 
you are painting all jews with a very broad brush no all jews not all billionaire jews are involved in evil schemes stop it despicable rem certified 
soros is to jew as kerry kaine biden pilosi or kennedy is to roman catholic soros is to jew like ryan or beck are to conservative or and a better example soros is to jew like oblamer is to christian anna miller 
yes all these people have one thing in common they claim connection to the evil hebrew yahweh  the tyrannical iron age war volcano god happy is the one who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks just another evil scripture found in your not so holy book psalm  stop making excuses for evil despicable rem certified 
howdy anna i an sorry i didnt make myself clear  i was stating none of those people are believing jews or christians  they believe they are god anna miller 
they have no humility nor conscience tatiana covington",2016-11-22

let us start with an historical fact treason and betrayal by the highest levels is a common feature of history whether it is judas vs jesus brutus vs julius caesar benedict arnold the rosenbergs jonathan pollard aldrich ames robert hanssen it is just a fact of life it does happen 
back in  when bill clinton was running for reelection he authorized the transfer of highly sensitive technology to china this technology had military applications and allowed china to close the gap in missile performance with the united states the transfers were opposed and severely criticized by the defense department 
at the same time bill clinton was transferring this technology to china huge donations began to pour into his reelection campaign from the us companies allowed to sell the technology to china and from american citizens of chinese descent the fact that they were us citizens allowed them to donate to political campaigns but it later emerged that they were acting as conduits for cash coming in from asian sources including chinese intelligence agencies the scandal eventually became known as chinagate 
john huang 
a close associate of indonesian industrialist james riady huang initially was appointed deputy secretary of commerce in  by  however he moved to the democratic national committee where he generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions from foreign sources huang later pleaded guilty to one felony count of campaign finance violations 
charlie trie 
like john huang trie raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions from foreign sources to democratic campaign entities he was a regular white house visitor and arranged meetings of foreign operators with clinton including one who was a chinese arms dealer his  contribution to clintons legal defense fund was returned after it was found to have been largely funded by asian interests trie was convicted of violating campaign finance laws in  
one of tries main sources of cash was chinese billionaire ng lap seng according to a senate report ng lap seng had connections to the chinese government seng was arrested in  over an unrelated bribery case but this gave investigators the opportunity to question seng about the chinagate scandal former united nations general assembly president john ashe was also caught in the bribery case and was about to testify to the links between the clintons and seng when he was found dead that very morning initially reported as having died from a heart attack johns throat had obviously been crushed at that point the official story changed to him accidentally dropping a barbell on his own throat 
ng lap seng with the clintons 
johnny chung 
gave more than  to the democratic national committee prior to the  campaign but it was returned after officials learned it came from illegal foreign sources chung later told a special senate committee investigating  clinton campaign fundraising that  of his contributions came from individuals in chinese intelligence chung pleaded guilty to bank fraud tax evasion and campaign finance violations 
chinagate documented by judicial watch was uncovered by judicial watch founder larry klayman technology companies allegedly made donations of millions of dollars to various democratic party entities including president bill clintons  reelection campaign in return for permission to sell hightech secrets to china bernard schwartz and his loral space  communication ltd later allegedly helped china to identify the cause of a rocket failure thereby advancing chinas missile program and threatening us national security according to records 
this establishes a history of the clintons treating us secrets as their own personal property and selling them to raise money for campaigns 
is history repeating itself it appears so 
let us consider a private email server with weak security at least one known totally open access point no encryption at all and outside the control and monitoring systems of the us government on which are parked many of the nations most closely guarded secrets as well as those of the united nations and other foreign governments it is already established that hillarys email was hacked one hacker named guccifer provided copies of emails to russia today which published them",2016-10-26

my theory of the downing of the aircraft is derived from the two reported wreckage sites the lie about the weather given out by the government and the loss of three radio links at the same time while the plane was still  miles from the crash site signs the plane was sabotaged 
first off the claims made in both time and newsweek that ron browns plane crashed in the worst storm in a decade are directly contradicted by the weather report issued by the dubrovnik airport tower adjacent to the crash site the storm simply did not exist 
while the plane carrying ron brown and his party was still  miles from the crash site  mile in the air and on the normal approach path three radio based links with three separate propagation paths all failed at the same time 
according to the aviation week  space technology article the dubrovnik tower lost voice radio contact at the same time the aircraft vanished from the screens of the approach radar at split and an awacs 
lets look at the split radar first 
the split radar watches the approach to dubrovnik airport which is where the ron brown aircraft was when it dropped off of the radar screen contrary to some silly claims made in this newsgroup before the plane was not flying in the mountains it was out over the water with open space all around the radar at split routinely tracks aircraft through that airspace without problem if it were normal for the split radar to lose traffic at that point on the approach path nobody would have mentioned it because it would be normal and expected behavior nothing unusual about it that comment was made about the target dropping off of the split radar establishes that it was an unusual event 
the split radar like all atc radar tracks primarily by aircraft transponder so when the split radar lost track of the ron brown aircraft what was lost was the transponder return as the aircraft was still on the approach path although just starting to veer slightly left 
now lets look at the awacs 
the awacs system is designed to track nontranspondered targets radar hits are placed in a computer system that keeps a list and tries to match the returns from the present radar sweep to the returns from the previous sweeps in order to generate meaningful target tracking data for the operators and weapons management systems part of that process involves target to target comparisons to make certain that what the computer thinks is target xyz this sweep is the same target it thought was xyz last sweep the total workload on the computer is a power function of the total number of nontranspondered targets being carried in the target list 
if a target has a transponder the awacs will track the target using the transponder return because not only is less computer power needed for a transpondered target but the workload for nontranspondered targets is reduced 
how do we know that the awacs was tracking the ron brown plane via transponder because the awacs lost its track at the same time that the split radar lost its transponder return had the awacs been tracking the ron brown plane via skinpaint there is no reason for it to lose track of the aircraft at the same time that split did 
had the awacs not reported losing contact we could surmise that either the awacs was tracking on skin paint or the split radar suffered a momentary failure but this was not the case 
it is also true that the awacs could have immediately reacquired the ron brown aircraft on skin paint and its not known for a fact that the computers did not add it as a nontranspondered target but the awacs was there to watch bosnia not the dubrovnik airport 
the two radar tracks propagating along two different paths come together at only one common point where a single failure could make the aircraft vanish from both split and the awacs and that is the radar transponder in the ron brown aircraft a failure of the transponder is the only explanation for the ron brown plane vanishing from two different radar screens at the same time while still  miles from the crash site and  mile above the adriatic sea 
at the same time that the aircraft vanished from the radars at split and the awacs the dubrovnik tower reported it lost voice radio contact with the aircraft 
this is a third distinct propagation path from the awacs and split in fact its direct line of sight from the dubrovnik tower to the location on the approach path where radio contact was lost there are no intervening geological features to block the radio signal the dubrovnik tower continued to communicate with other aircraft in the area so the radios in the tower were not at fault 
the data reported in the aviation week  space technology article shows evidence that two sperate systems on board the ron brown aircraft failed at the same time the cockpit radios and the radar transponder 
the radios and radar transponders come together at only one common point where a single failure could make the aircraft vanish from both split and the awacs and lose voice radio contact with the dubrovnik tower and that is is the electrical system failed in mid air while still  miles from the crash site and  mile above the adriatic sea on the approach path how do we know the problem extended beyond the electrical system 
simple prior to the loss of radio the flight crew had acknowledged receiving a weather report they knew there was clear air beneath them there is only one reason for the flight crew suddenly without any instruments at all not to descend out of a cloud layer into the clear air they knew was below them and thats if the event that severed the electrical cables also severed the flight control cables which occupy the same midline conduit in the  possible trigger 
given the unscheduled nature of the trip a timer would be useless to pinpoint the exact geographic location of the detonation however knowing the approach pattern into the airport a location over the adriatic can be selected by the altitude of the aircraft along the glide slope 
the simplest explanation which fits the twin wreckage sites and the early news reports of a water crash is that of an altitude triggered bomb placed on the aircraft prior to departure as the aircraft climbs above a certain altitude the device is armed as the aircraft descends through the trigger altitude say  feet the device detonates why did the plane make it to shore 
as the reports have pointed out the weather was not ideal the pilot even with the best navigation aids in the world would be fully justified in delaying his descent in order to stay in clear air as long as possible then ducking quickly down through the clouds to find the airfield 
this means that the altitude triggered bomb would have detonated far closer to land than expected with the result that portions of the wreckage came on shore 
the  mile spread between wreckage sites indicates an airborne event which blew part of the aircraft off the same  mile distance coupled with the shallow impact angle suggests that the aircraft was still flyable and that the pilot may have been trying to make it to the airfield when the crash into the hill occurred was thermite used 
its impossible to state based on the information available to the public but thermite is a definite possibility it can be made using available materials and will not show up on the various detectors which would sense chemical explosives such as c thermite when ignited burns at half the temperature of the surface of the sun and would burn through the aluminum of an aircraft with ease packed in a suitcase near the top of the baggage compartment of the converted  it would be in an ideal location to sever the control linkages and to short out the planes electrical system as well as burning a hole through the skin dumping debris into the ocean how bad was the weather 
there were several reports in the media that dubrovnik was in the grip of the worst storm of the decade this is not true as can be seen by the weather information contained in the aviation week article and the first news articles from reuters the weather was not exceptionally bad indeed the wind conditions were excellent providing a  knot head wind with no cross component at the runway perfect landing conditions below the overcast at  feet visibility was km or  miles assorted news articles washington april  upi  a us air force plane carrying commerce secretary ron brown in the

wednesday on the fate of his friend and political ally commerce secretary ron brown made emotional visits to browns home and the federal department where he spoke to distraught federal workers after hearing mid morning that the military plane carrying brown had crashed near the adriatic coast in croatia clinton wasted little time in sharing his grief and trying to console the brown family friends and workers the browns have a son michael and a daughter tracey a family spokesman said the browns were still holding out hope the president and first lady hillary rodham clinton dressed in dark suits and wearing solemn faces spent nearly an hour at browns washington home where he lived with his wife alma couriers also arrived with flowers from wellwishers and the secret service checked each bunch before allowing them into the townhouse the clintons emerged from the home located in the affluent secluded chatworth neighborhood of washington with their heads down and the first lady appearing to choke back tears brown was head of the democratic national committee when clinton was the partys presidential nominee in  and he was greatly credited with playing a key role in putting a democrat in the white house after the visit with the family the clintons immediately headed across town to commerce department headquarters where the president addressed employees who packed the auditorium clinton told the gathering that he his wife and other administration officials came to be with the employees of the commerce department at this very difficult hour the plane carrying secretary brown and his delegation including a number of your colleagues business leaders and leaders of the united states military went down today near dubrovnik croatia clinton told the workers we do not know for sure what happened there clinton said he asked browns wife what he should tell the department workers she said tell them ron was proud of them that he liked them that he believed in them and that he fought for the commerce department and tell them that youre going to do that now clinton said winning sustained applause from the crowd many of the hundreds of department employees were visibly shaken at the news with many crying and others holding and consoling one another also present at the commerce department when clinton spoke were several cabinet secretaries including attorney general janet

how to have honest elections it is enough that the people know there was an election the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything  joseph stalin 
following the florida election debacle of  americans were promised a more honest transparent and verifiable system of elections we didnt get it because the elkection stealers won that election and decided that keeping the current system was their best guaarantee of reelection 
the election of  changed that the candidate being cheated by the system donald trump still prevailed thanks to a landslide that overcame the vote rigging he will see having an honest election system as his best chance for a second term hence there is a real opportunity to throw out the current system whch is designed to encourage stealing elections and replace it with a system that hinders cheating as much as possible 
to begin stolen elections are a reality in this nation john f kennedy stole the  election from richard nixon nixon stole his reelection in what becvame known as the watergate scandal george w bush likely stole the  election from al gore and everyone had a ringside seat watching hillary clinton trying to steal the election from donald trump 
a good place to start to learn about election stealing is the hbo documentary hacking democracy it is available on netflix amazon live and hulu here is a youtube video of the final scenes showing how an electronic voting machine has the election results changed without even needing to touch the machine 
for more information please visit httpblackboxvotingorg  the website operated by bev harris who is featured in the hbo documentary 
now then i wish to offer a suggestion for a very simple way to have an open and honest election system it is not  foolproof but is designed to make it very difficult for cheating to happen and difficult to conceal it this stands in sharp contrast to the current system which is designed to facilitate and conceal the manipulation of elections 
first some basic rules 
 no electronic machines 
 no central tabulation centers 
everyone who votes must have id to prove they are a us citizen and eligable to vote absentee ballots are only given to those who can prove they are unable to vote in person 
after the voters vote their finger is marked with ink that takes a week to fade away to prevent them from voting more than once 
all voting is done on paper ballots when the polls close the precincts handcount the ballots in full view of witnesses and verify the accuracy all paper ballots are to be stored for an entire year after the election 
the totals for that polling place are posted for all to see and copies provided to all witnesses 
in the city newspaper the next day all the totals for all the city precincts are printed along with totals for the state this allows everyone to first verify that their precinct totals were reported accurately and to verify the math leading to the city totals for themselves 
now we move up a level the state newspapers print all the city totals and again the totals for the state this allows everyone to first verify that their city totals were reported accurately and to verify the math leading to the state totals for themselves 
final level the national newspapers print all the state totals and tally up the winners this allows everyone to first verify that their state totals were reported accurately and to verify the math leading to the national totals for themselves 
what this does is create a system where there are literally millions of americans watching and verifying the vote counts from polling place to final totals yes it is a bit slower than the instantguessing on tv but that will prevent the corporate media from using projections to try to discourage voters of unfavored candidates from heading to the polls there is in fact no law that says the winners of the elections have to be announced immediately and certainly most americans are willing to trade speed for accuracy in such an important matter in the early days of this nation prior to the telegraph it would take weeks for the populace to learn who won the elections 
as i said this is not a  perfect system it is only as good as the people running it but it does make stealing elections very difficult and that should always be the design objective of any election system share this article with your social media",2016-10-26

kennedys united states notes were not borrowed from the federal reserve but created by the us government and backed by the silver stockpiles held by the us government it represented a return to the system of economics the united states had been founded on and was perfectly legal for kennedy to do all told some four and one half billion dollars went into public circulation eroding interest payments to the federal reserve and loosening their control over the nation five months later john f kennedy was assassinated in dallas texas and the united states notes pulled from circulation and destroyed except for samples held by collectors 
john j mccloy 

john j mccloy president of the chase manhattan bank and president of the world bank was named to the warren commission presumably to make certain the banking dimensions behind the assassination were concealed from the public kennedys eo  has never been repealed and is still in effect although no modern president dares to use it almost all of the current national debt has been created since  
as we enter the eleventh year of what future history will most certainly describe as world war three we need to examine the financial dimensions behind the wars 
towards the end of world war two when it became obvious that the allies were going to win and dictate the post war environment the major world economic powers met at bretton woods a luxury resort in new hampshire in july of  and hammered out the bretton woods agreement for international finance the british pound lost its position as the global trade and reserve currency to the us dollar part of the price demanded by roosevelt in exchange for the us entry into the war absent the economic advantages of being the worlds goto currency britain was forced to nationalize the bank of england in  the bretton woods agreement ratified in  in addition to making the dollar the global reserve and trade currency obligated the signatory nations to tie their currencies to the dollar the nations that ratified bretton woods did so on two conditions the first was that the federal reserve would refrain from overprinting the dollar as a means to loot real products and produce from other nations in exchange for ink and paper basically an imperial tax that assurance was backed up by the second requirement which was that the us dollar would always be convertible to gold at  per ounce 
the bretton woods resort new hampshire 
the federal reserve being a private bank and not answerable to the us government did start overprinting paper dollars and much of the perceived prosperity of the s and s was the result of foreign nations obligations to accept the paper notes as being worth gold at the rate of  an ounce then in  france looked at the huge pile of paper notes sitting in their vaults for which real french products like wine and cheese had been traded and notified the united states government that they would exercise their option under bretton woods to return the paper notes for gold at the  per ounce exchange rate the united states had nowhere near the gold to redeem the paper notes by  the imf estimated foreign central banks held  billion us dollars however the united states had only  billion in gold to redeem those paper notes so on august th  richard nixon temporarily suspended the gold convertibility of the us federal reserve notes 
nixon announces the end of gold convertability 
later termed the nixon shock this move effectively ended bretton woods and many global currencies started to delink from the us dollar 
the nixon shock 
worse since the united states had collateralized their loans with the nations gold reserves it quickly became apparent that the us government did not in fact have enough gold to cover the outstanding debts foreign nations began to get very nervous about their loans to the us and understandably were reluctant to loan any additional money to the united states without some form of collateral so richard nixon started the environmental movement with the epa and its various programs such as wilderness zones roadless areas heritage rivers wetlands all of which took vast areas of public lands and made them off limits to the american people who were technically the owners of those lands but nixon had little concern for the environment and the real purpose of this land grab under the guise of the environment was to pledge those pristine lands and their vast mineral resources as collateral on the national debt the plethora of different programs was simply to conceal the true scale of how much american land was being pledged to foreign lenders as collateral on the governments debts eventually almost  of the nation itself all of this is illegal as the enclave clause of the constitution limits the federal government to owning the land under federal government buildings and military bases and that enclave clause was written into the constitution by the founding fathers specifically to prevent the federal government simply seizing the land belonging to the people to sell off pledge as collateral or rent

with open lands for collateral already in short supply the us government embarked on a new program to shore up sagging international demand for the dollar the united states approached the worlds oil producing nations mostly in the middle east and offered them a deal in exchange for only selling their oil for dollars the united states would guarantee the military safety of those oilrich nations the oil rich nations would agree to spend and invest their us paper dollars inside the united states in particular in us treasury bonds redeemable through the slave labor of future generations of us taxpayers the concept was labeled the petrodollar in effect the us no longer able to back the dollar with gold was now backing it with oil other peoples oil and that necessity to keep control over those oil nations to prop up the dollar has shaped americas foreign policy in the region ever since 
but as americas manufacturing and agriculture has declined the oil producing nations faced a dilemma those piles of us federal reserve notes were not able to purchase much from the united states because the united states had little other than real estate anyone wanted to buy europes cars and aircraft were superior and less costly while experiments with gmo food crops led to nations refusing to buy us food exports israels constant belligerence against its neighbors caused them to wonder if the us could actually keep their end of the petrodollar arrangement oil producing nations started to talk of selling their oil for whatever currency the purchasers chose to use 
saddam hussein and the lie of iraqs nuclear weapons 
saddam hussein 
iraq already hostile to the united states following desert storm demanded the right to sell their oil for euros in  and in  the united nations agreed to allow it under the oil for food program instituted following desert storm one year later the united states reinvaded iraq under the lie of saddams nuclear weapons lynched saddam hussein and placed iraqs oil back on the world market only for us dollars 
the clear us policy shift following  away from being an impartial broker of peace in the mideast to one of unquestioned support for israels aggressions only further eroded confidence in the petrodollar deal and even more oil producing nations started openly talking of oil trade for other global currencies 
gaddafi and the gold dinar 
gaddafi 
over in libya muammar gaddafi had instituted a stateowned central bank and a value based trade currency the gold dinar 
the gold dinar 
gaddafi announced that libyas oil was for sale but only for the gold dinar other african nations seeing the rise of the gold dinar and the euro even as the us dollar continued its inflationdriven decline flocked to the new libyan currency for trade this move had the potential to seriously undermine the global hegemony of the dollar french president nicolas sarkozy reportedly went so far as to call libya a threat to the financial security of the world so the united states invaded libya brutally murdered qaddafi  the object lesson of saddams lynching not being enough of a message apparently imposed a private central bank and returned libyas oil output to dollars only the gold that was to have been made into the gold dinars  tons of it is as of last report unaccounted for 
update emails surfacing as part of the investigation into hilary clintons use of a private email server for classified information confirm that the real reason for the us invasion of libya was to destroy the threat of the gold dinar becoming a panafrican currency displacing the dollar 
general wesley clark blows the whistle on us plans to conquer the oilrich middle east 
according to general wesley clark the master plan for the dollarification of the worlds oil nations included seven targets iraq syria lebanon libya somalia sudan and iran venezuela which dared to sell their oil to china for the yuan is a late addition what is notable about the original seven nations originally targeted by the us is that none of them are members of the bank for international settlements the private central bankers private central bank located in switzerland this meant that these nations were deciding for themselves how to run their nations economies rather than submit to the international private banks 
update emails from secretary of state hillary clinton released as part of the benghazi investigation confirm that the true motive for the attack on libya was to control the libyan oil reserves and to destroy libyas goldbacked currency 
now the bankers gun sights are on iran which dares to have a government central bank and sell their oil for whatever currency they choose the war agenda is as always to force irans oil to be sold only for us dollars and to force them to accept a privately owned central bank malaysia one of the few remaining nations without a rothschild central bank is now being invaded by a force claimed to be al qaeda and has suffered numerous suspicious losses of its commercial passenger jets 
with the death of president hugo chavez plans to impose a us and banker friendly regime on venezuela are clearly being implemented 
so just where is the gold 
germanys gold bullion where is it 
the german government recently asked for the return of some of their gold bullion from the bank of france and the new york federal reserve france has said it will take  years to return germanys gold the united states has said they will need  years to return germanys gold this suggests strongly that the bank of france and the ny federal reserve have used the deposited gold for other purposes most likely to cover gold futures contracts used to artificially suppress the price of gold to keep investors in the equities markets and the central banks are scrambling to find new gold to cover the shortfall and prevent a gold run so it is inevitable that suddenly france invades mali ostensibly to combat al qaeda with the us joining in mali just happens to be one of the worlds largest gold producers with gold accounting for  of mali exports war for the bankers does not get more obvious than that 
mexico has demanded a physical audit of their gold bullion stored at the bank of england and along with venezuelas vast oil reserves larger than saudi arabia venezuelas gold mines are a prize lusted after by all the central banks that played fast and loose with other peoples gold bullion so we can expect regime change if not outright invasion soon 
can a bank foreclose on your house if they have provided nothing of real value in the mortgage 
a little remembered footnote in banking history occurred in december  a bank was moving to foreclose on a house and the homeowner decided to fight the foreclosure in court arguing that contract law requires two contracting parties to agree to swap two items of value legally called the consideration in the case of first national bank of montgomery vs jerome daly  daly argued that since the bank simply wrote a number in a ledger to create the loaned money out of think air there was no real value and therefore no legally binding consideration the lawyers for the bank admitted that this is how the bank works they create money out of thin air as a ledger or computer entry which you must repay with your labor and there was no law in  that specifically gave banks the legal right to do that daly argued that because there was no equal consideration the mortgage was null and void and the attempt to foreclose invalid the jury agreed so did judge mahoney who resisted demands to overrule the jury in favor of the bank and wrote a simple streightforward decision that stated that there was no question that the mortgage contract was void because the claim that the bank simply made up the money out of thin air was not disputed by the bank itself 
judge mahoney was murdered with poison less than six months later and the lawyer representing daly was debarred the decision in favor of daly was then nullified on procedural grounds and the entire matter forgotten 
you are brainwashed 
you have been raised by a public school system and media that constantly assures you that the reasons for all these wars and assassinations are many and varied the us claims to bring democracy to the conquered lands they havent the usual result of a us overthrow is the imposition of a dictatorship such as the  cia overthrow of irans democratically elected government of mohammad mosaddegh and the imposition of the shah or the  cia overthrow of chiles democratically elected government of president salvador allende  and the imposition of augusto pinochet  or to save a people from a cruel oppressor revenge for  or that tired wornout catch all excuse for invasion weapons of mass destruction assassinations are always passed off as crazed lone nuts to obscure the real agenda 
the real agenda is simple it is enslavement of the people by creation of a false sense of obligation that obligation is false because the private central banking system by design always creates more debt than money with which to pay that debt private central banking is not science it is a religion a set of arbitrary rules created to benefit the priesthood meaning the owners of the private central bank the fraud persists with often lethal results because the people are tricked into believing that this is the way life is supposed to be and no alternative exists or should be dreamt of the same was true of two earlier systems of enslavement rule by divine right and slavery both systems built to trick people into obedience and both now recognized by modern civilizatyion as illegitimate now we are entering a time in human history where we will recognize that rule by debt or rule by private central bankers issuing the public currency as a loan at interest is equally illegitimate it only works as long as people allow themselves to believe that this is the way life is supposed to be 
but understand this above all private central banks do not exist to serve the people the community or the nation private central banks exist to serve their owners to make them rich beyond the dreams of midas and all for the cost of ink paper and the right bribe to the right official 
behind all these wars all these assassinations the hundred million horrible deaths from all the wars lies a single policy of dictatorship the private central bankers allow rulers to rule only on the condition that the people of a nation be enslaved to the private central banks failing that said ruler will be killed and their nation invaded by those other nations enslaved to private central banks 
the socalled clash of civilizations we read about on the corporate media is really a war between banking systems with the private central bankers forcing themselves onto the rest of the world no matter how many millions must die for it indeed the constant hatemongering against muslims lies in a simple fact like the ancient christians prior to the knights templars private banking system  muslims forbid usury or the lending of money at interest and that is the reason our government and media insist they must be killed or converted they refuse to submit to currencies issued at interest they refuse to be debt slaves 
so off to war your children must go to spill their blood for the moneyjunkies gold we barely survived the last two world wars in the nuclearbioweapon age are the private central bankers willing to risk incinerating the whole planet just to feed their greed 
apparently so 
this brings us to the current situation in the ukraine russia and china 
the european union had been courting the government of the ukraine to merge with the eu and more to the point entangle their economy with the privateowned european central bank the government of the ukraine was considering the move but had made no commitments part of their concern lay with the conditions in other eu nations enslaved to the ecb notably cyprus greece spain and italy so they were properly cautious then russia stepped in with a better deal and the ukraine exercising the basic choice all consumers have to choose the best product at the best price dropped the eu and announced they were going to go with russias offer it was at that point that agents provocateurs flooded into the ukraine covertly funded by intelligence agency fronts like canvas and usaid stirring up trouble while the western media proclaimed this was a popular revolution snipers shot at people and this violence was blamed on thenpresident yanukovich however a leaked recording of a phone call between the eus catherine ashton and estonias foreign minister urmas paet confirmed the snipers were working for the overthrow plotters not the ukrainian government urmas paet has confirmed the authenticity of that phone call 
this is a classic pattern of covert overthrow we have seen many times before since the end of ww the us has covertly tried to overthrow the governments of  nations succeeding  times examples include the  overthrow of irans elected government of mohammed mossadegh and the imposition of the shah the  overthrow of chiles elected government of salvador allende and the imposition of the pinochet dictatorship and of course the current overthrow of ukraines elected government of yanukovich and the imposition of the current unelected government which is already gutting the ukraines wealth to hand to the western bankers 
brazil russia india china and south africa have formed a parallel financial system called brics scheduled to officially launch on january   as of this writing some  nations are ready to trade with brics in transactions that do not involve the us dollar despite us economic warfare against both russia and china the ruble and yuan are seen as more attractive for international trade and banking than the us dollar hence the us attempt to fan the ukraine crisis into war with russia and attempts to provoke north korea as a back door to war with china

flag waving and propaganda aside all modern wars are wars by and for the private bankers fought and bled for by third parties unaware of the true reason they are expected to gracefully be killed and crippled for the process is quite simple as soon as the private central bank issues its currency as a loan at interest the public is forced deeper and deeper into debt when the people are reluctant to borrow any more that is when the keynesian economists demand the government borrow more to keep the pyramid scheme working when both the people and government refuse to borrow any more that is when wars are started to plunge everyone even deeper into debt to pay for the war then after the war to borrow more to rebuild when the war is over the people have about the same as they did before the war except the graveyards are far larger and everyone is in debt to the private bankers for the next century this is why brown brothers harriman in new york was funding the rise of adolf hitler 
as long as private central banks are allowed to exist inevitably as the night follows day there will be poverty hopelessness and millions of deaths in endless world wars until the earth itself is sacrificed in flames to mammon 
the path to true peace on earth lies in the abolishment of all private central banking everywhere and a return to the stateissued valuebased currencies that allow nations and people to become prosperous banks do not have an obligation to promote the public good  alexander dielius ceo germany austrian eastern europe goldman sachs  i am just a banker doing gods work  lloyd blankfein ceo goldman sachs ",2016-10-26

the death of john kennedy by michael rivero
there have been two official investigations one concluded oswald acted alone the other that there was a conspiracy after half a century many of the key documents which could tell the whole story remain classified john f kennedys brain is still missing from the national archives why if it is an open and shut case why the secrecy if oswald was just a crazed lone gunman 
the house select committee on assassinations concluded that john f kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy based on the recording of the gunshots fired in dealey plaza captured over a police radio a total of  impulses were caught on the tape but citing budgetary constraints the hsca only had  of them analyzed the analysis concluded that all  were gunshots two of them occurring within  a second of each other too close to be fired by one man comparisons of the echoes with test shots fired in dealey plaza confirmed that at least one of the recorded shots had indeed been fired from the grassy knoll needless to say the existence of  rather than just  gunshots destroyed the oswald as lone gunman coverup warren supporters quickly tried to dismiss the audio record of the gunshots by claiming that the recording was actually of gunshots in another part of the city and confused for dealey plaza shots because of a timing error without explaining just where the other shots had occurred or why the echo patterns exactly matched the test shots fired in dealey plaza the warren supporters declared victory new research has shown that the report that dismissed the audio recording of the gunshots was itself deeply flawed and ignored evidence that confirmed both the location and time of the recording as being in dealey plaza at the time of the jfk assassination this means that the original house select committee on assassinations conclusion is the correct one there were at least five gunshots in dealey plaza two of them within  second of each other and at least one of the shots came from the grassy knoll update the deathbed confession of cia agent e howard hunt to his son on the jfk assassination update numerous witnesses had reported a large obvious exit wound in the back of kennedys head consistent with the reports of a gunshot from the grassy knoll the warren commission dismissed the exit wound and reports of a shooter on the grassy knoll and published in their report photographs of the back of kennedys head that showed no damage now it has been revealed that the warren commission did not publish the actual autopsy photos but substituted photos taken after morticians had reconstructed kennedys head an anticipation of a possible open casket viewing prior to the funeral  as had been done with lincoln 
although described as a mixup the simplest explanation is deliberate deception by the warren commission dan rathers fib 
dan rather at the time an unknown newscaster from a small market texas tv station viewed the zapruder film then described it to america on the cbs network as this recording of that broadcast shows rather lied to all of america in claiming that the head shot pushed john f kennedys head forward 
rather makes the claim that kennedys head rocketed forward at  in the above video he also makes a point of saying there were only three shots in total rathers meteoric rise to network status and stardom soon followed this broadcast when the zapruder film was finally shown publicly during jim garrisons trial of cia agent clay shaw rathers lie was revealed for all to see a revealing wink 
most americans who lived through the kennedy assassination are very familiar with the above photo of vice president lyndon johnson being sworn in as president aboard air force one 
but very few people are aware of another photograph snapped just seconds later

the state of georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the department of public health after it investigated what he said in his church 
but dr eric walsh is resisting issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers 
the states demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by walsh against the department of health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations 
hes getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by houston officials for copies of his sermons 
walshs ordeal began in may  when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency only a week later a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a seventhday adventist church 
lee rudd the agencys human resources director then assigned staff members to listen to the youtube recordings immediately two days later walsh was fired 
at that point lawyers with first liberty institute joined forces with the atlanta legal team of parks chesin  walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency 
police state usa how orwells nightmare is becoming our reality chronicles how america has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state and what led to an outofcontrol government that increasingly ignores the constitution order today 
now in response to walshs lawsuit the state delivered a request for production of documents that demands among a flood of other paperwork copies of his sermon notes and transcripts 
this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church said jeremy dys senior counsel for first liberty 
no government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons said walsh in a statement released by his lawyers i cannot and will not give up my sermons unless i am forced to do so 
officials with the georgia department of health declined to respond to a wnd request for comment instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general who did not respond to a request for comment 
walshs lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support 
on the guest list was pastor dave welch of houston one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code 
wnd broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when rush limbaugh described parkers actions as possibly one of the most vile filthy blatant violations of the constitution that i have seen 
the mayor at the time annise parker withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest  
in a prepared statement wednesday on walshs case welch said i cant believe im saying this but georgias demand is even worse than when the mayor of houston demanded  different categories of materials including sermons from  us 
welch the executive director of the texas pastor council said what is happening to walsh is worse than what happened in houston for multiple reasons 
first this is state government coming after a pastor not just a rogue mayor in one city he said also the state is demanding much more material sermons sermon notes all documents without even topical or time limits it could even include margin notes in this pastors preaching bible its almost as if they are ransacking the pastors study this sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor every church every denomination and every citizen of faith in america 
leaders of concerned women for america legislative action committee part of the nations largest public policy womens group with  members also came to walshs defense 
penny nance ceo said the words of reverend dr martin luther king jr that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere still reverberate today  especially as we witness the gestapolike tactics of his native state the state of georgias blatant attack on religious freedom as they discriminate against another pastor dr eric walsh is indeed a threat to every american whatever our religious beliefs 
can there be a clearer violation of our first amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor examine and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share 
wnd reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed walshs sermons and then fired him 
no one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon dys told fox news when the case was filed he was fired for something he said in a sermon if the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything the original state investigation of walshs sermons apparently was sparked by one complaint from an official with a county democratic party and gay activist 
state officials also joked about informing walsh of his firing 
the telephone call was between dr patrick oneal an agency official and kate pfirman an agency financial officer the call was captured on an answering machine which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up 
pfirman said and im gonna be very  im gonna try to come off as very cold because i dont want to say very much if i try to make it warm  ive thought that through its gonna just not  theres no warm way to say it anyway 
then there was laughter from both parties 
oneal then said to inform walsh youre out and there was another round of laughter 
its very funny pfirman said

674,no title,"state that fired pastor demands his sermons notes this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority published  mins ago bob unruh about   archive bob unruh joined wnd in  after nearly three decades with the associated press as well as several upper midwest newspapers where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially print dr eric walsh photo first liberty 
the state of georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the department of public health after it investigated what he said in his church 
but dr eric walsh is resisting issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers 
the states demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by walsh against the department of health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations 
hes getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by houston officials for copies of his sermons 
walshs ordeal began in may  when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency only a week later a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a seventhday adventist church 
lee rudd the agencys human resources director then assigned staff members to listen to the youtube recordings immediately two days later walsh was fired 
at that point lawyers with first liberty institute joined forces with the atlanta legal team of parks chesin  walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency 
police state usa how orwells nightmare is becoming our reality chronicles how america has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state and what led to an outofcontrol government that increasingly ignores the constitution order today 
now in response to walshs lawsuit the state delivered a request for production of documents that demands among a flood of other paperwork copies of his sermon notes and transcripts 
this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church said jeremy dys senior counsel for first liberty 
no government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons said walsh in a statement released by his lawyers i cannot and will not give up my sermons unless i am forced to do so 
officials with the georgia department of health declined to respond to a wnd request for comment instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general who did not respond to a request for comment 
walshs lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support 
on the guest list was pastor dave welch of houston one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code 
wnd broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when rush limbaugh described parkers actions as possibly one of the most vile filthy blatant violations of the constitution that i have seen 
the mayor at the time annise parker withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest  
in a prepared statement wednesday on walshs case welch said i cant believe im saying this but georgias demand is even worse than when the mayor of houston demanded  different categories of materials including sermons from  us 
welch the executive director of the texas pastor council said what is happening to walsh is worse than what happened in houston for multiple reasons 
first this is state government coming after a pastor not just a rogue mayor in one city he said also the state is demanding much more material sermons sermon notes all documents without even topical or time limits it could even include margin notes in this pastors preaching bible its almost as if they are ransacking the pastors study this sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor every church every denomination and every citizen of faith in america 
leaders of concerned women for america legislative action committee part of the nations largest public policy womens group with  members also came to walshs defense 
penny nance ceo said the words of reverend dr martin luther king jr that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere still reverberate today  especially as we witness the gestapolike tactics of his native state the state of georgias blatant attack on religious freedom as they discriminate against another pastor dr eric walsh is indeed a threat to every american whatever our religious beliefs 
can there be a clearer violation of our first amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor examine and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share 
wnd reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed walshs sermons and then fired him 
no one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon dys told fox news when the case was filed he was fired for something he said in a sermon if the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything the original state investigation of walshs sermons apparently was sparked by one complaint from an official with a county democratic party and gay activist 
state officials also joked about informing walsh of his firing 
the telephone call was between dr patrick oneal an agency official and kate pfirman an agency financial officer the call was captured on an answering machine which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up 
pfirman said and im gonna be very  im gonna try to come off as very cold because i dont want to say very much if i try to make it warm  ive thought that through its gonna just not  theres no warm way to say it anyway 
then there was laughter from both parties 
oneal then said to inform walsh youre out and there was another round of laughter 
its very funny pfirman said

it doesnt matter who the republicans would have nominated they were gonna get the treatment trumps getting it wouldnt have mattered limbaugh said wednesday 
they would go out of their way to find ways to destroy jesus christ if he could be nominated as a republican the democrats would do everything they could include calling him a liar the bible a fake book whatever it took rush limbaugh

they would scour the historical record looking for children he had fathered anything they could do to disapprove the gospel to discredit jesus thats who they are thats what they would do 
limbaugh said the point he was stressing was that republicans would never escape this kind of media assault based on who we nominate donald trumps rnc acceptance speech photo screenshot from rnc live feed 
i say this because a lot of you never trumpers are out there claiming that this is exactly what you get when you nominate a guy like trump no its exactly what you get when you nominate a republican whenever there is any opposition to the democrats this is what they do it doesnt matter theyre gonna do it they did it to romney

suddenly the head of the organization expressed suspicion about the donations overseas origin and decided to return it 
thats one of the significant revelations in the latest in a series of videos released by okeefe called rigging the election 
okeefe explained he had a fictitious donor meet with bob creamer who was a staffer at americans united for change a group supporting clinton for president until the videos started appearing last week 
he said creamer who boasted of working directly for the clinton campaign directed that the  donation go to aufc to disrupt rallies and fund bracketing ops

the fourth video breaks down the process of the longterm investigation it comes after creamers announcement that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities 
okeefe and project veritas action have filed a complaint with the federal election commission 
among the revelations in the latest video was creamer was boasting of his close links to president obama 
oh barack obamas was the best campaign in the history of american politics i mean the second one i mean the first was good too i was a consultant to both the second one was everything hit on every level and every aspect he said hes a pro ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago 
when asked whether a potential donor could meet obama creamer said ok you may have a lot more opportunity once he is done in  days  i was just at an event with him in chicago friday of last week he is just as good as ever i do a lot of work with the white house on their issues helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in i mean for immigration reform for the  the health care bill trying to make america more like britain when it comes to gun violence issues

have you ever noticed how washington always has a plan to solve everybodys problem  except their own 
for the federal government its always easy and tempting to look at problems  real or imagined  outside of the beltway and solve them from afar 
you will recall of course how former attorney general eric holder was going to stop police shootings all over america with sensitivity training the power and force of the federal government and investigations investigations and more investigations 
now loretta lynch his successor also known as hillary clintons guardian angel is set to turn police shootings throughout america into big business and more power for washington 
her latest pet project is assembling a national database on interactions between law enforcement and civilians she reported this month 
accurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about communitypolice relations lynch said in the days ahead the department of justice will continue to work alongside our local state tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive useful and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve 
the irony here is thick indeed 
one of lynchs goals she says is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them 
meanwhile lynch presides over the most egregious coverup of the most outrageous police shooting case i have ever seen in my life  namely the killing of miriam carey a young black mother with baby in tow who was gunned down by washington cops and secret service agents for a wrong turn in the nations capital 
lynch wants reports 
so does wnd which has been pursuing the information through freedom of information act requests and finally after being stonewalled for years a lawsuit 
so does the public and the family of miriam carey unfortunately lynch is holding back on a few things missing evidence the page memo with findings analysis of evidence and conclusions in the carey shooting investigation this would show the evidence and reasoning that led the department of justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers why they considered this a justifiable homicide  or whether they should have based on the evidence why officers used deadly force whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies video of shooting at capitol police guard post at intersection of constitution ave maryland ave and nd street only stills have been released video would show more clearly if officers life actually was in danger as doj claimed when he fired fatal shot to careys head not one of the five witnesses at the scene said carey was driving at the officer as the doj claimed police statements the police report said four officers fired shots at carey two from the capitol police and two from the secret service not one statement from those officers was in the report their names were also redacted redacted information an attorney in the washington dc mayors office said the only redactions were names in order to protect privacy it turned out much more was redacted than names the report was riddled with blackedout sections and missing information  pages in the report were entirely blacked out  pages were mostly blacked out  pages were partially blacked out some of the blackedout pages just included a heading marked evidence some just had a date witness statements an astonishing  witness accounts are missing from the police report the police report stated there were seventytwo  witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio andor video recordings copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the usao for review copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the technical support unit tsu located at the iad of those  witness statements only  were in the materials provided to wnd leaving  missing statement transcripts none of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses own words were provided just paraphrased versions in what the former nypd officer sanders described as cop talk white house guard post video stills were released but not the video it would show whether anyone was manning the post when carey drove up whether she tried to drive around the offduty guard who dragged a gate in front of her and whether she sped off or left at a normal speed as a witness said police radio recordings no recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of carey were provided in the foia material also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions instant messaging between squad cars and police headquarters ballistics and forensics reports the justice department washington metro police department responses to foia requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report 
i could go on and on for people who want facts and reports the us justice department under both holder and lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press 
weve been at this for a long time  years yet the stonewall and coverup of a horrendous unjustifiable outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues 
do we really expect eric holder and loretta lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that

698,no title,"will it be representative government or thugocracy exclusive erik rush envisions clinton using high court as a bludgeon against liberty published  mins ago erik rush about   archive erik rush is a columnist and author of sociopolitical fare his latest book is negrophilia from slave block to pedestal  americas racial obsession in  he was the first to give national attention to the story of sen barack obamas ties to militant chicago preacher rev jeremiah wright initiating a media feeding frenzy erik has appeared on fox news hannity and colmes cnn and is a veteran of numerous radio appearances print 
 i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy for me that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community that will stand up and say no to citizens united a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system  
 hillary clinton 
the first salvo from democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton or rather her answer to the first question posed by fox news chris wallace to her and donald trump at the third presidential debate was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy 
those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing dog whistle politics rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition ms clintons response to wallaces question where they wanted to see the supreme court take the country and their views on how the constitution ought to be interpreted however was representative of this tactic 
while womens rights and those of the lgbt community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court since objectively women wouldnt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president and the lgbt community accounts for less than  percent of the american population clintons answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress 
womens rights is of course dog whistle for unfettered abortion even lateterm abortion which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment lgbt rights is dog whistle for disenfranchising the majority of americans who hold traditional values primarily christians leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of christians in europe and canada a direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the us at least not at present however judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result 
let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the constitution and that clintons overall objectives are manifestly evil hillary clintons stated priorities for the supreme court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the constitution and individual liberties rather than allowing it to perform its designated function the hypocrisy attendant to clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see despite being conveniently ignored by the press 
clintons reference to powerful corporations and the wealthy and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization citizens united was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy clinton is quite wealthy and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of american socialists even if citizens united were a vehicle for dark unaccountable money the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the muslim brotherhood with which bill and hillary clinton have been partnered for decades or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by george soros the former nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in america someone with whom the clintons also have a long association 
one need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind clintons debate rhetoric to discern what a hillary clinton presidency might look like her actions to date  and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office  should suffice quite nicely despite the craven complicity of the establishment press mainstream media there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the democratic leviathan supporting her and which facilitated barack obamas rise to power are fundamentally malignant 
in recent days weve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality thats been brought to bear in getting clinton elected from democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of clintons popularity to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the clinton campaign the democratic national committee and the white house 
the bottom line here is that hillary clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality what all americans  not just voters and not just republicans  need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the republican party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the democratic party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and yes even vote for their candidates 
the burning question is this in the end are we to be governed by the will of the people or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government

700,snow reports from around the northland duluth through  am saturday,"election crossroads socialism or capitalism exclusive jane chastain explains impact of dems living wage proposal published  mins ago about   archive jane chastain is a southern californiabased broadcaster author and political commentator despite her present emphasis on politics jane always will be remembered as the nations first female tv sportscaster spending  years on the sports beat jane blogs at janechastaincom she is a pilot who lives on a private runway print 
our country is at a crossroads never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road one road the one favored by politician hillary clinton and her democratic colleagues promises to lead us to a socialist utopia the other favored by businessman donald trump and some of his republican colleagues promises to get us back on the road toward freemarket capitalism 
it is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system in this system they control the lions share of our money and in turn hand out favors in this system they make the major decisions that affect our lives as the government accumulates more and more power we invariably end up with less statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power the more of our hardearned money he or she spends yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again expecting a different result 
weve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the freemarket system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world no it isnt perfect but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life 
notice what i didnt say is simply willing to work hard there is the belief by some that if you simply work hard you should have what these politicians now call a living wage  the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs which is around  a year in some parts of the country the democrats want to replace the minimum wage which is a training wage with this living wage that completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently 
ideally it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does 
unfortunately this socalled living wage will destroy jobs it will cause companies to automate and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate 
but this living wage is only part of what the democrats want to do in the name of fairness 
this no doubt appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better 
wages have remained flat for far too long but the democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators 
most people simply do not understand that businesses dont pay taxes they are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices and when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high such as weve seen in obamacare there is a large outcry thats when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services thats when the door to socialismcommunism slams shut 
they tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear our benevolent government will take care of us they are offering us free college  or almost free loans  in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve and if we dont get that job the government is going to give us free health care free food and free housing under president hillary there will be free child care free preschool and paid family leave what a country 
if we dont reach our goals everything will be ok because social security and medicare will be there to finance our retirement and if that isnt enough the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television 
what about the fact that social security and medicare are going broke how long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses they never talk about that 
as british prime minister margaret thatcher once said the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples money 
dont be fooled this election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket its an important fork in the road one fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom the other offers a free lunch

701,the death of john kennedy,"print 
before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out allow me to explain my decision to vote for donald trump on nov  
first im writing this because i have been asked incessantly for months how i would be voting not because i think im someone special or that what i do should influence you 
second im not endorsing donald trump in my mind theres a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate 
third i respect those in the nevertrump camp and share many of their concerns including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies just to name a few among the nevertrump voices i respect are columnists like david french and ben shapiro bloggers like matt walsh and evangelical leaders like russell moore and beth moore 
fourth i take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over trump as if he were some kind of savior figure supporting him as if he were st donald i also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of trumps failings constantly saying let him who is without sin cast the first one see john  this is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation 
fifth my decision to vote for trump barring something earthshattering between now and nov  is consistent with my position which has been  during the gop primaries i issued strong warnings against voting for trump while we had other excellent choices i did this in writing  on video and on the radio but always stating that if trump won the nomination i would reevaluate my position  once trump became the republican candidate i wrote that i was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote  i have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would i vote for hillary for two strong warnings about hillary see here and here  
so what has convinced me that i should now vote for donald trump 
the culture war is not over gain hope courage and practical advice in michael browns latest book outlasting the gay revolution where homosexual activism is really going and how to turn the tide 
first i believe that he actually is serious about appointing prolife proconstitution supreme court justices when he said during the last debate that if youre prolife you want to see roe v wade overturned and when he reiterated at his gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of  potential appointees he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flipflop if elected 
second one reason i endorsed sen ted cruz was because he took on the political establishment both democratic and republican to the point of calling it the washington cartel trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system although unfortunately hes been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system so my vote for him is also a protest vote 
third i am voting for the republican platform not the republican party which means im in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole 
fourth while i have always felt that the line were electing a president not a pastor was overstated and superficial if we rephrased it to say were electing a general to train handtohand combat warriors not a pastor it might have more relevance in other words we are not looking for trump to be a moral reformer even if hedoes appoint righteous judges and at this point he certainly is anything but a moral example although we pray he will be truly converted and become one rather out of our choices for president which are stark we are voting for the one most likely to defeat hillary and make some good decisions for the nation not be the savior and with things so messed up in america the handtohand combat analogy is closer to home 
fifth within the first few minutes of the last debate the massive differences between hillary and trump were there for the world to see she a proabortion radical and an extreme supporter of the lgbt agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against lateterm abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties since i have the opportunity to vote i feel that i should vote for trump 
sixth trump continues to be drawn to conservative christians and not just ones who tickle his ears one of my dear friends has spent hours with trump and members of his family and he has told me that in  years of ministry no one has received him as openly and graciously as has trump yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms while i am not one of those claiming that trump is a bornagain christian i see absolutely no evidence of this the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on it also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president 
seventh although im quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation im far more concerned with what we as gods people do with our own lives and witnesses and for me the state of the church of america is much more important than the state of the white house in that context i echo the words and warning of dr martin luther king jr the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state but rather the conscience of the state it must be the guide and the critic of the state and never its tool if the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority 
so in sum  my hope is in god not donald trump and i do recognize that either hillary or trump has the potential to do great harm to america  my urgent call is for us as followers of jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation  i will continue to urge all believers not to vote for hillary clinton whose policies will certainly do us great harm and  ultimately the most effective way to defeat hillary is to vote for trump while also praying that god will use him for good  not for evil 
in the end if trump gets elected and fails miserably i will be grieved but not devastated if he does well i will rejoice 
either way though my vote is just that a vote my greater role is to live a life pleasing to god with the hope of advancing a gospelbased moral and cultural revolution receive michael browns commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for michael browns alerts you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email name",2016-11-21

every ethnic group except whites blocvotes for the democrats coincidentally the democrats have brought in another  to  million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades 
it doesnt help that white voters cant agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate in  workingclass whites sat out the election rather than vote for the outoftouch rich guy they saw in mitt romney this year the outoftouch rich guys say theyll vote for hillary because trump is tacky and gross 
the sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats  the top  percent the rest of us will be their servants 
the people who will be worse off are everybody else  the working class the middle class who will soon be working class and most of all women minorities children the elderly the weakest and most vulnerable members of society 
look to mexico for your future  or any third world country or to univisions jorge ramos the ruling class in mexico is composed of europeanlooking white descendants of spanish conquistadors who raped the native population giving them only their spanish names in return british settlers in america brought women with them 
explaining latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape criminal justice researcher shana maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household and women are subordinate to men  hispanics and latinos are more likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim the victim not the perpetrator is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family 
one american detective said that today police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing 
when it comes to multiculturalism you cant say we love the empanadas  but we dont want yearold men raping their nieces  this isnt an a la carte menu we get all the attributes of the cultures were importing 
as described in excruciating detail in adios america the lefts plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants 
thus for example where i would have chosen the headline illegal alien convicted of incest child rape the chattanooga tenn times free press went with the less catchy man guilty in case of human smuggling 
and where i would have used the headline illegal alien repeatedly raped yearold girl at job site the commercial dispatch in columbus mississippi went with the more subtle columbus resident charged with molestation 
immigrant women arrive in america thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape incest and spousal murder are acceptable only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled 
in  brooklyn judge edward pincus sentenced a chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood the female head of the asianamerican legal defense and education fund margaret fung applauded the ruling 
somewhat amazingly newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime anything to keep the third world immigration flowing 
in  a yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens who cheered and videoed the attack 
when the news first broke shaneequa jupiter who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger that could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants 
even if shaneequa had scoured the headlines she would have been on the lookout for austin men or two 
compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack 
 two held in attack on child  austin americanstatesman texas july   
 two mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  daily mail online july   
needless to say the new york times did not cover the mexican illegalalien gang rape at all 
the ultimate primer on the bluecollar billionaire order ann coulters book in trump we trust e pluribus awesome 
by contrast the times and every major american news outlet extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age at about the same time in about the same place 
the second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was  but she was an enthusiastic participant sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex 
those rapes just a few years earlier got a fullcourt press the defendants were africanamerican the victim was mexican 
that time there were articles in the huffington post gq slate salon and mother jones it even made the new york times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team 
similarly within a few months of one another in  two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur alabama for assaults on yearold girls one suspect was africanamerican the other was a hispanic immigrant only one made the newspaper guess which one 
when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of hillarys foreign policy successes journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men 
conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and colleagues definitely not islam 
sampling of new york times commentary on logans rape 
 why we need women in war zones i would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened  this attack also had nothing to do with islam 
 reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not  in my experience muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment 
perhaps american men could do better but as american women may soon discover they never had it so good 
manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america they are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the democrats and cheap labor to the rich the chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife for example came to america based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher 
our country will be zimbabwe but  if all goes according to the democrats plan  theyll get to be mugabe

two weeks left to go in the election and the electorate feels like a battered nfl fan the game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage 
democrats can be counted upon to call the republican opponent racist whether the opponent is the priestly mitt romney or the supreme court justice who wrote the dred scott decision donald trump you see is racist because among other reasons at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him my africanamerican hillary clinton on the other hand is not antisemitic even though three witnesses one of whom took and passed a polygraph claim that she referred to her husbands former congressional campaign manager as a fing jew bastard 
with a republican candidate the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies  big or small real or imagined  while giving the democrat a pass so trumps failure to ever apologize outweighs an examination of clintons flatout lie during the third debate when she insisted that the supreme court heller case was about toddlers as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the second amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms 
in heller nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word toddler appear clinton a year ago flatout said the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment to normal people this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on which again was whether we as individuals have a right to keep and bear arms 
meanwhile we learn more and more about what the media labels an email scandal when the accurate description is national security scandal the espionage act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters the law does not require as fbi director james comey falsely stated an intent nor is it relevant as clinton insists whether or not her private server the one she maintained in her basement was hacked 
five people who worked with or for clinton including her chief of staff all received immunity deals something normally given to get someone to flip on a target some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed but the target that is to say hillary clinton was deemed by comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted so why the immunity deals who knows  and as far as most of the media are concerned who cares 
clinton insists that president obama doesnt get enough credit for the swell job he did with the economy this would be the economy in which for the first time in history a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least  percent growth in gross domestic product this would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that gallup ceo jim clifton calls the big lie given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are underemployed 
meanwhile its yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed groped touched or made fun of by trump has appeared with her attorney feminist gloria allred allred a clinton supporter sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of trumps sexual misconduct and her support for clinton who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husbands accusers one such accuser juanita broaddrick claims not only that she was raped by bill clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape hillary clinton verbally threatened her 
hillary clinton mind you has never been asked by anyone in the media about broaddricks allegation never and only one national reporter sam donaldson has ever asked bill clinton about juanita broaddricks allegation ever clintons answer he referred donaldson to his lawyer david kendall donaldson quickly tried again asking the thenpresident to simply deny it same answer my attorney  speaks for me and that was that 
so hillary clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy thats given us the worst recovery since  who has clearly violated the espionage act and placed the nations security at risk who told the benghazi victims families that the death of four americans was inspired by a video while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different whose charitable foundation engaged in paytoplay in haiti so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and nondonors went to the back of the line who wants to gut the second amendment who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of isis russia and the chinese and whose media compadres including scribes with the new york times washington post and cnbc have been outed by wikileaks as colluding with her campaign and she is now oddson favorite to become the next president of the united states receive larry elders commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for larry elders alerts you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email name",2016-11-02

new york youtube on wednesday suspended the account of danney williams the yearold who has claimed since the s to be the black son of former president bill clinton 
youtube citing repeated or severe violations of our terms of use andor community guidelines declared the account cannot be restored 
the youtube decision blocked the nineminute feature banished  the untold story of danney williams which had received  million views since williams posted it last week produced by filmmaker joel gilbert it drew nearly  views per day and more than  viewer comments with the overwhelming majority expressing support for williams and outrage at the clintons for not being willing to allow a dna test to determine paternity 
like the reporting you see here sign up for free news alerts from wndcom americas independent news network 
my youtube account has been deleted but the same video appears in  other places on youtube alone williams said on his facebook page after being notified of youtubes decision youtube cant handle the truth please share billclintonson 
twitter also continues to allow williams to post the banished video on danney williams page  but the twitter link to youtube displays the message  this video is no longer available because the youtube account associated with this video has been terminated sorry about that 
the video is still running on danney williamsclintons facebook page  as well as on the youtube channel operated by gilbert 
attempt to silence danney williams 
gilbert told wnd he helped williams file an online appeal form on youtube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated 
the behavior of youtubegoogle in suspending danneys account is outrageous there have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any youtube terms or guidelines gilbert said 
gilbert was outspoken in charging youtube with partisan political motives for the suspension 
the only possible explanation is that the clinton campaign requested youtubegoogle to silence danney to run him off the plantation as danney said hillary clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the arkansas governors mansion in  gilbert said 
danney cannot be silenced any longer he continued hillary may try to sweep danney williams under the rug but its not going to work this time his story is out there and every day more and more people understand bill and hillary clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin 
see the danney williams video feature 
wnd reported oct  that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate attorneys for williams were in las vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding dna evidence from the former president 
accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating williams that went viral on the internet 
no definitive dna test 
wnd reported that no dna test was conducted in  despite media reports to the contrary when williams claim first surfaced 
clinton defenders since  have contended the tabloid star magazine conducted a dna showdown proving bill clinton was not williams father citing star magazine editor phil bunton saying at the time there was no match nothing even close 
but in an interview bunton told wnd that no blood sample was obtained from clinton and star magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test 
i dont remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on clintons dna bunton told wnd 
bunton is now the owner of the rivertown magazine in haverstraw new york 
he affirmed to wnd that the tabloid relied on the dna evidence for clinton published by independent counsel kenneth starr extracted from the infamous monica lewinsky blue dress 
we got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media including the new york times wanting to know when we were going to get the dna back bunton recalled to wnd we thought it was going to turn out to be his son but when the dna came back there was no story there even to write 
the dna test released by kenneth starr was the second of two dna laboratory tests the fbi had run on clinton but the public record leaves no doubt that starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the fbi 
twitter rules 
many other figures who have challenged the democratic party or the leftleaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets including james okeefe and his project veritas which has exposed clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hiddencamera videos just as okeefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud oct  twitter shut down his account  claiming violations of twitter rules the notice said he must delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules which prohibit harassing other users threatening other users disclosing other users private information or violating other rules in a statement okeefe said he relies on social media to bypass the media and directly reach the public on monday okeefe wrote in a tweet project veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to youtube calling the apparent block bizarre earlier this month okeefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a hillary clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day his account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hiddencamera video that exposed a clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns the daily caller reported  project veritas posted an undercover video oct  proving hillary clinton supporters were inciting violence at donald trump rallies to gain negative media coverage millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours but it didnt show up on googles trending list on youtube which google owns noted silenceisconsentnet  it did however trend on twitter which google does not own breitbart blogger milo yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by twitter minutes before his gays for trump party at the republican national convention for some  months the makers of the new movie im not ashamed about the first victim of the columbine killers in colorado in  were unable to promote their movie through youtube the trailer was taken down late in  and the movies entire channel was suspended

wikileaks has provided a treasure trove of inside information on what hillary clinton really thinks about important issues such as trade and immigration but clinton herself has chosen not to answer questions about the revelations 
she has focused instead on criticizing the russians as the source of the hacks despite the fact there is no proof of russian involvement 
the emails also shed light on how the clinton campaign interacts with wall street banks with friendly media and how it worked to undermine the candidacy of democratic rival bernie sanders with the help of the dnc 
wikileaks says it has about  emails from the private gmail account of john podesta a senior democratic party official who has served as white house chief of staff under president bill clinton and a senior adviser to president obama he was the author of obamas climate change policy john podesta 
in february podesta moved seamlessly from the white house to become chairman of hillary clintons  presidential campaign

wikileaks has provided a treasure trove of inside information on what hillary clinton really thinks about important issues such as trade and immigration but clinton herself has chosen not to answer questions about the revelations 
she has focused instead on criticizing the russians as the source of the hacks despite the fact there is no proof of russian involvement 
the emails also shed light on how the clinton campaign interacts with wall street banks with friendly media and how it worked to undermine the candidacy of democratic rival bernie sanders with the help of the dnc 
wikileaks says it has about  emails from the private gmail account of john podesta a senior democratic party official who has served as white house chief of staff under president bill clinton and a senior adviser to president obama he was the author of obamas climate change policy john podesta 
in february podesta moved seamlessly from the white house to become chairman of hillary clintons  presidential campaign 
here are some of the most explosive revelations from the wikileaks email dumps featuring podestas account and others 
preference for muslim americans in  when podesta served as cochair of presidentelect barack obamas transition team michael froman a former citibank executive sent podesta a list of african american latino and asian american candidates broken down by cabinetdeputy and underassistantdeputy assistant level plus a list of native american arabmuslim american and disabled american candidates the arab american list came with a special note to exclude arab christians  they had to be both arab and muslimas new republic reports obamas eventual cabinet appointments ended up almost entirely as froman recommendedfroman ultimately became the recipient of the largest bailout from the federal government during the financial crisis

713,young patient,"print fairfax county virginia voter jena jones told wnd and radio america she found this democrat insert included with her absentee ballot among others 
democratic party officials in fairfax county virginia are categorically denying that prodemocrat campaign materials were included in the same envelope as a voters absentee ballot arguing that pamphlets were sent in a separate mailing to absentee voters from the fairfax county democratic committee or fcdc 
earlier this week jena and david jones shared their story of finding more than they expected in the envelope that contained her ballot see images of the materials jena and david say they found at the end of this article also included are two images from democrats showing what they say is confusion on the part of the voters 
i found a letter from the governor of virginia asking me to please vote democrat and help keep virginia blue this year jena explained then i got a letter from the fairfax county democratic committee giving me a stepbystep yesandno what i should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot 
in recent days at least two more people contend they received the same materials in the envelope with their absentee ballots 
after the report was first published and shared on facebook by david jones fairfax county democratic committee executive director frank anderson replied to davids post to dispute their account of what the ballot envelope contained 
these materials were not sent in the same envelope as the ballot the ballot is mailed separately by the office of elections political parties are free to mail items to voters who request absentee ballots the two envelopes arrived at the same time commented anderson 
that triggered a quick backandforth between david jones and anderson 
i hate to tell you but youre wrong all items came in one envelope jones said 
like the reporting you see here sign up for free news alerts from wndcom americas independent news network 
impossible that letter came out of my office we never have access to other peoples ballots replied anderson 
then it seems those that sent the ballots have access to your letters said jones who should i believe you or my lying eyes 
anderson then stated that political parties are informed when anyone requests an absentee ballot and mailings are sent to those voters to promote democratic party candidates and positions on ballot initiatives 
i am literally sitting down the hall from the place where those envelopes are stuffed we are a political office and have no business handling anyones ballots you can believe what you want to believe concluded anderson 
the virginia department of elections did not respond to repeated attempts for a response but after seeing reports from wnd and radio america anderson protested the premise of the story 
please stop spreading these absurd allegations that are just hearsay from a misinformed voter who cannot verify his claim stated anderson in an email in which he also explained why he believed the jones account could not be accurate 
he shared a photo sent by state sen scott surovell showing his absentee ballot envelope next to a separate envelope containing democratic party advocacy 
in a formal interview fcdc communications adviser bruce neilson told wnd and radio america the jones version of what the ballot envelope contained cannot be true 
its not possible said neilson who then explained how absentee voters are approached by the local democrats 
voting is a sacred privilege and a right of every citizen he said the activity of voting is also a public record the fairfax county democratic committee receives a notice of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot we get that information as public information on the day the ballot is mailed 
the same day the ballot is mailed our volunteers prepare materials to advise voters what the fairfax county democratic committee knows to be democratic positions on the ballot said neilson noting the materials include fliers on candidates and ballot proposals like the meals tax 
listen to the wndradio america interview with bruce neilson 
however he insists those materials are never sent with the ballot itself 
that material is mailed in a separate envelope labeled with our initials  fcdc  and our return address in fairfax virginia and would be received either the same day perhaps the day before or the day after she received her official absentee ballot from the government neilson said 
its a separate mailing its a separate stamp its a separate envelope its very easy to confuse where they came from if you have all those materials on the table at the same time while youre filling in your votes he said 
jones is standing by her story  percent as is her husband david says its a very clear memory 
jena opened the envelope that contained her ballot the green sample ballot the twosided letter from the governor and card with kids on it saying go vote or something of that nature there was also the return envelope which i signed david said

they dont have our materials he said our materials are printed for us by our printer and we have complete control over our materials in our office and they come from our office in our mailing they dont go anywhere else 
its not possible that the county government is distributing partisan democratic materials its never happened before im not aware of it happening now and i dont think that it would happen anywhere in the future neilson said 
there are only a few known complaints of stuffed ballot envelopes in fairfax county leading david jones to believe an individual in the government is responsible he accepts the explanation that the fairfax county democratic committee is not responsible for what he and jena discovered with her ballot

neilson said there is zero chance of that scenario being true

714,limbaugh democrats would destroy jesus christ,"print saeed toosi right and ayatollah khamenei 
after failed attempts by top iran officials to cover up the scandal the nations leading reciter of the quran and close friend of ayatollah khamenei has been accused of raping  of his students and charged with advocating corruption 
saeed toosi  winner of the first prize for reading the quran both internationally and locally fell under suspicion after a broadcast by persian voice of america  banned for viewing by tehran  in which three alleged rape victims came forward with written and audio evidence and described sexual assaults by toosi reported al arabiya 
in an audio recording toosi said that khamenei knew of the sexual assaults and together with the head of irans judicial authority had agreed to a coverup to protect the reputation of the nations quranic institution and the regime 
its time to stop tiptoeing around the facts the politically incorrect guide to islam and the crusades is a muchneeded dose of truth about the religion of peace 
one document has toosi admitting that his actions with his students had been a mistake one of the victims  a recent firstplace winner in a quranic competition  claimed he was raped when he was  while traveling abroad with toosi to attend a competition the mentor according to the charge booked the pair in a single hotel room where the attack took place 
all victims who have filed statements were between  and  at the time of the alleged attacks the incidents took place over the past seven years during quranic trips to more than  countries in the world aimed at spreading the quranic culture and to participate in quranic competitions 
toosi is highly respected as irans most celebrated reader of the quran and was previously called an exemplary model to be followed by khamenei current supreme leader of iran he is a permanent guest of khamenei in the annual quranic councils celebrated during ramadan last may toosi was asked to recite verses from the quran at the opening session of the shura council with many of irans top officials in attendance 
the students told persian voa they had filed charges with the house of leadership but officials dismissed their claims citing a repentance letter from toosi admitting his actions and claiming to be a changed man 
while iran officially imposes the death penalty for homosexuality sex between men and boys is viewed with some toleration in the culture causing confusion as to whether the resulting relationships are consensual or forced the case is further complicated by the fact allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful officials are unheard of in the islamic republic 
according to the reformist amad news officials held a twohour emergency meeting with the judiciary following outcries over the broadcast the initial intent to bury the story failed after it reached the national press and resulted in toosi now being charged 
judiciary chief ayatollah sadeq larijani whom the victims audio showed conspiring with khamenei to cover up the incidents defended the regimes handling of the case london guardian reported larijani called for punishment of those who cooperated with hostile media in the voa story so we know who is loyal to the revolution and who is not 
the case has been given to a judge for a ruling though there will be no public trial awad news reports members of the army of the guardians of the islamic revolution are planning to assassinate toosi to end the scandal and save the regimes reputation 
toosi who has denied the charges against him  calling them total lies meant to discredit irans religious institutions and the ayatollah  is reportedly threatening to release the names of  of irans top officials he claims are implicated in the rape and molestation of children if the prosecution proceeds",2016-10-26

716,see dems accept foreign cash to disrupt trump rallies,"print saeed toosi right and ayatollah khamenei 
after failed attempts by top iran officials to cover up the scandal the nations leading reciter of the quran and close friend of ayatollah khamenei has been accused of raping  of his students and charged with advocating corruption 
saeed toosi  winner of the first prize for reading the quran both internationally and locally fell under suspicion after a broadcast by persian voice of america  banned for viewing by tehran  in which three alleged rape victims came forward with written and audio evidence and described sexual assaults by toosi reported al arabiya 
in an audio recording toosi said that khamenei knew of the sexual assaults and together with the head of irans judicial authority had agreed to a coverup to protect the reputation of the nations quranic institution and the regime 
its time to stop tiptoeing around the facts the politically incorrect guide to islam and the crusades is a muchneeded dose of truth about the religion of peace 
one document has toosi admitting that his actions with his students had been a mistake one of the victims  a recent firstplace winner in a quranic competition  claimed he was raped when he was  while traveling abroad with toosi to attend a competition the mentor according to the charge booked the pair in a single hotel room where the attack took place 
all victims who have filed statements were between  and  at the time of the alleged attacks the incidents took place over the past seven years during quranic trips to more than  countries in the world aimed at spreading the quranic culture and to participate in quranic competitions 
toosi is highly respected as irans most celebrated reader of the quran and was previously called an exemplary model to be followed by khamenei current supreme leader of iran he is a permanent guest of khamenei in the annual quranic councils celebrated during ramadan last may toosi was asked to recite verses from the quran at the opening session of the shura council with many of irans top officials in attendance 
the students told persian voa they had filed charges with the house of leadership but officials dismissed their claims citing a repentance letter from toosi admitting his actions and claiming to be a changed man 
while iran officially imposes the death penalty for homosexuality sex between men and boys is viewed with some toleration in the culture causing confusion as to whether the resulting relationships are consensual or forced the case is further complicated by the fact allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful officials are unheard of in the islamic republic 
according to the reformist amad news officials held a twohour emergency meeting with the judiciary following outcries over the broadcast the initial intent to bury the story failed after it reached the national press and resulted in toosi now being charged 
judiciary chief ayatollah sadeq larijani whom the victims audio showed conspiring with khamenei to cover up the incidents defended the regimes handling of the case london guardian reported larijani called for punishment of those who cooperated with hostile media in the voa story so we know who is loyal to the revolution and who is not 
the case has been given to a judge for a ruling though there will be no public trial awad news reports members of the army of the guardians of the islamic revolution are planning to assassinate toosi to end the scandal and save the regimes reputation 
toosi who has denied the charges against him  calling them total lies meant to discredit irans religious institutions and the ayatollah  is reportedly threatening to release the names of  of irans top officials he claims are implicated in the rape and molestation of children if the prosecution proceeds",2016-10-26

a member of the increasingly divided and disputatious alabama supreme court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on their empathetic feelings instead of the law 
alabamas judges are elected and accountable wrote justice tom parker this week federal judges as recently noted by chief justice roberts in his dissent in obergefell v hodges  a case in which five lawyers on the united states supreme court announced a fundamental right to samesex marriage are unaccountable and unelected 
he pointed out that three of the four dissenting us supreme court justices in obergefell noted on eight different occasions that the five lawyers who decided obergefell were unelected chief justice roberts said on two occasions that those unelected five lawyers were consequently unaccountable 
parker previously commented that the five lawyers failed to base their decision on legal reasoning history tradition the courts own rules or the rule of law but upon their empathetic feelings 
obergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges he said 
he was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by chief justice roy moore who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriagebased case that the court was reviewing when the obergefell case which created samesex marriage nationwide was announced 
moore who is challenging the punishment insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves they did with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear moores arguments 
parker said active judges should have been included in the panel because retired judges too are unelected and unaccountable 
unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda instead of faithfully applying the rule of law parker warned obergefell is not the first case concerning samesex marriage to prove this principle true before the united states supreme court decided obergefell the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the united states 
dont miss phyllis schlaflys book now available autographed at the wnd superstore who killed the american family 
before obergefell  states passed laws affirming traditional marriage in  of those states the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional of the  state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts  of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional each of the  courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable 
he explained what happens when activist judges are held to account citing the situation that developed in iowa 
the supreme court of iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down iowas traditional marriage law as unconstitutional the judges of the supreme court of iowa are appointed by the governor of iowa however although the judges are initially appointed they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires 
he explained that after the iowa legislature adopted onemanonewoman marriage as law in april  in a decision largely viewed as judicial activism the supreme court of iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of iowa and held the law unconstitutional 
the very next year three of the judges  who had concurred in varnum had to stand for a retention election all three were removed from office by vote of the people of iowa this was the first time since iowa adopted its retentionelection system that any judge had ever failed to be retained the people of iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law 
mathew staver chairman of of liberty counsel which is representing moore said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial systems handling of moores case 
chief justice moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive  equal justice under the law he wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law he said 
the people of alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable at every turn this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of alabama never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired we hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution the court of the judiciary violated the law when it suspended chief justice moore for life even though it lacked the  vote never before under the unanimity requirement of coj rule  has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term a sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a fourpage order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life this is not right 
supporters of moore also have filed an ethics complaint against lyn stuart who has been acting as alabamas chief justice 
she is accused of violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding chief justice roy moore 
the complaint comes from the sanctity of marriage alabama organization 
if the judicial inquiry commission really cares about ethics fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the alabama judiciary they will no doubt take our complaint seriously as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on chief justice moore said tom ford a spokesman for the group 
the complaints the group said outline how acting chief justice lyn stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety failed to perform the duties of her office impartially failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary 
parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary 
daniel horowitz  senior editor at conservative review told wnd that the nation is going through a social transformation without representation 
it is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues whether its the bureaucrats whether its the courts and as it relates to even religious liberty even property rights immigration our voting rights who gets to vote he said 
horowitz tackles the topic of social transformation without representation in his book stolen sovereignty how to stop unelected judges from transforming america 
how did we get here horowitz asked rhetorically and the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this this was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges the legal profession and unelected bureaucrats that is social transformation without representation which as scalia warned is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first american revolution 
samesex marriage was mandated for the nation in  by the bare  majority made up of anthony kennedy ruth ginsburg stephen breyer sonia sotomayor and elena kagan john roberts clarence thomas samuel alito and the late antonin scalia opposed it 
the majority found in the constitution a right to samesex marriage overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states 
it elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the us supreme court majority 
for one two of the justices in the majority kagan and ginsburg were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for samesex marriage apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality without their votes the case would have gone the other way 
they refused 
then there was the us supreme courts own opinion just two years earlier in the defense of marriage act case in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage 
and there also are those who point out that the constitution doesnt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people 
as wnd reported  ginsburg who voted in favor of samesex marriage has performed samesex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements justice elena kagan also has performed samesex weddings and promoted gay rights at harvards law school while she was at its helm 
critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest 
the foundation for moral law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case but they refused to acknowledge the request the foundation explained that canon a of the code of conduct for united states judges provides a judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court  usc sec a mandates that a justice shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned 
rabbi jonathan cahn author of the new york times bestseller the harbinger and the inspiration behind the isaiah  judgment movie has criticized the supreme courts assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage 
at a prayer event in washington he said the justices of the supreme court took up their seats in a hearing on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage that the event should even take place is a sign this is america of george washingtons warning  a nation at war against its own foundation 
washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained 
justices can you judge the ways of god there is another court and there is another judge where all men and all judges will give account he warned 
if a nations high court should pass judgment on the almighty should you then be surprised god will pass judgment on the court and that nation we are doing that which israel did on the altars of baal he said 
see jonathans cahns message at washington man of prayer event at the capitol 
the united states conference of catholic bishops is calling samesex marriage an intrinsic evil 
and officials from several counties in tennessee have adopted statements opposing the supreme court 
wnd also reported when dozens of top legal scholars from the likes of washington  lee boston college kansas state notre dame university of texas villanova vanderbilt hillsdale university of nebraska catholic university and regent university issued a statement encouraging all state and federal officials to treat the supreme courts recent creation of samesex marriage as anticonstitutional and illegitimate 
it cannot  be taken to have settled the law of the united states said the statement from the american principles project  
we call on all federal and state officeholders to refuse to accept obergefell as binding precedent for all but the specific plaintiffs in that case to recognize the authority of states to define marriage and the right of federal and state officeholders to act in accordance with those definitions to pledge full and mutual legal and political assistance to anyone who refuses to follow obergefell for constitutionally protected reasons to open forthwith a broad and honest conversation on the means by which americans may constitutionally resist and overturn the judicial usurpations evidence in obergefell",2016-10-26

at a prayer event in washington he said the justices of the supreme court took up their seats in a hearing on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage that the event should even take place is a sign this is america of george washingtons warning  a nation at war against its own foundation 
washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained 
justices can you judge the ways of god there is another court and there is another judge where all men and all judges will give account he warned 
if a nations high court should pass judgment on the almighty should you then be surprised god will pass judgment on the court and that nation we are doing that which israel did on the altars of baal he said 
see jonathans cahns message at washington man of prayer event at the capitol 
the united states conference of catholic bishops is calling samesex marriage an intrinsic evil 
and officials from several counties in tennessee have adopted statements opposing the supreme court 
wnd also reported when dozens of top legal scholars from the likes of washington  lee boston college kansas state notre dame university of texas villanova vanderbilt hillsdale university of nebraska catholic university and regent university issued a statement encouraging all state and federal officials to treat the supreme courts recent creation of samesex marriage as anticonstitutional and illegitimate 
it cannot  be taken to have settled the law of the united states said the statement from the american principles project  
we call on all federal and state officeholders to refuse to accept obergefell as binding precedent for all but the specific plaintiffs in that case to recognize the authority of states to define marriage and the right of federal and state officeholders to act in accordance with those definitions to pledge full and mutual legal and political assistance to anyone who refuses to follow obergefell for constitutionally protected reasons to open forthwith a broad and honest conversation on the means by which americans may constitutionally resist and overturn the judicial usurpations evidence in obergefell",2016-10-26

washington  the campaigns of donald trump and hillary clinton are looking for signs anywhere and everywhere that might suggest who will move into the white house in january 
a company that makes trump and hillary kippas or yarmulkes has some good news for one of the presidential hopefuls  trump head coverings are winning in a landslide among the orthodox jewish clientele 
so far the company picakippa has sold  trump yarmulkes to  for clinton 
my kippa yarmulke company sells trump and hillary kippas and are keeping track of who is selling more uri turk founder and chief kippa officer told wnd we see it as an early exit poll of the orthodox jews a type of bellwether of where this important community is leaning once the first debate came around the orders started flying in with much more interest in the trump kippas 
picakippa is the brainstorm of two former elite red beret idf soldiers from miami turk says the company is the leader in the kippa market and has been selling trump and hillary custom kippas on its site since august all the while keeping a running tally of which one has sold more 
our mission is to help jews everywhere show and wear their jewish pride with our beautifully unique and completely customizable picture kippas the company says on its website 
it donates  percent of every kippa sale to the lone soldier center in israel assisting young lone soldiers during difficult times 
turk said while american jews have leaned heavily democratic for decades the past few presidential races have seen orthodox jews who make up over  percent of american jewry vote republican in ever increasing numbers he attributes that fact to the democrats putting daylight between america and israel 
a number of influential jewish protrump organizations have emerged chief among them jews choose trump and jewish democrats for trump a recent poll of florida jews showed orthodox voters are leaning toward trump by a  margin 
according to turk picakippa has sold many trump kippas to a congregant of ivanka trumps synagogue on the liberal upper east side of manhattan and has gotten orders for trump kippas from israel australia britain and even mexico picakippa has also gotten hate mail from jews unhappy they are selling the trump designs he says",2016-10-26
