wire reported on friday about the fbis surprising announcement that it would be reopening the clinton email case due to new evidence of classified information found on sex cheat anthony weiners newly estranged husband of clinton chief aid huma abedin computer which was subject to a seperate investigation will this really yield anything significant in the  days runningup to the nov th election or is this just clever democrat party smoke and mirrors it seems that washingtons political tricksters have already sprung into action 
after comeys shock announcement a leaked memo appeared out of nowhere supplied to fox news  in which comey and the fbi seem to be going through a routine set of prescribed political moves designed to implement damage control 
elite circles fbi head james comey and friend hillary clinton 
certainly a desperate democratic party and an even more desperate obama white house over the last  weeks obama and his wife michelle have been out campaigning more that hillary clinton herself could be pressuring or nudging the fbi on this volatile issue which could easily tilt a close presidential race against donald trump aside from the obvious potential of another clinton scandal yesterdays fbi move could also be a prelude to the following possible scenarios protect the president who is already deeply tied to the clinton email coverup democratic party machine has created a distraction to coverup latest wikileaks dump fbi are trying to restore lost public confidence over allegations of favoring hillary clintons create a controlled explosion this weekend to clear the decks for another salacious trump scandal next week 
note despite calls from the clinton camp for fbi to disclose what they have which they cannot by law anyway youd think hillary would have already known that it is highly unlikely that the fbi will release any real specifics before the election  if they have anything at all its just too early to tell 
see also fbi james comey was board member of hsbc  clinton foundation  drug cartel bank of choice 
the fbi director stoked outrage last month when he announced that he would not recommend the justice department seek an indictment against clinton or any of the other parties to the investigation  allowing clinton to dodge any criminal probe before the election  despite the fact that comey stated to a congressional investigative committee that clinton was extremely careless and that clinton openly lied about her handling classified information on her unsecured private server throughout her tenure as the us secretary of state 
zero hedge adds 
now it is the democrats turn to rage at comey and the fbi although comey likely did not have much choice had he kept the information secret it certainly would have leaked as we predicted as such his best recourse was to come clean although many have speculated about the cryptic nature of the disclosure needless to say all comey would need to do to regain the demcorats trust and favor is to announce in just a few days that nothing material has been found and that the second probe is also over 
here is leaked aka just covering my ass memo from fbi director james comey 
watch this space here is a highlight reel of hillary clinton lying on at least  occasions when asked direct questions about her illegal private email server

fbi october surprise 
according to reports  in a letter written today fbi director james comey  stated that the fbi has begun a new probe into hillary clinton related emails once again comey offered scant details about the new probe but due to an unrelated case additional classified material may have been mishandled on clintons personal email server 
cnbc reported the latest fbi developments including a passage from comeys letter discussing the new investigation 
in previous congressional testimony i referred to the fact that the federal bureau of investigation fbi had completed its investigation of former secretary clintons personal email server due to recent developments i am writing to supplement my previous testimony comey wrote 
in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation he added 
although the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and i cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony comey concluded 
humas estranged sexting husband 
according to a new report released via the new york times  
the presidential campaign was rocked on friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the nowclosed investigation into hillary clinton s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to anthony d weiner the estranged husband of a top clinton aide  in a letter to congress  the fbi director james b comey said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case which law enforcement officials said was an fbi investigation into illicit text messages from mr weiner to a yearold girl in north carolina mr weiner a former democratic congressman from new york is married to huma abedin the top aide comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting clinton off the hook for mishandling and lying to congress about classified emails coming through her home brew email server while she was secretary of state after previously closing the case comey has done a uturn and is now saying the fbi will review the new emails to for classified information and see whether it was mishandled 
this unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a wikileaks docudump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between clinton foundation donors and former president bill clinton s private financial activities among those included in the memo was a  million dollar business arrangement under bill clinton inc with another  million dollar deal scheduled over nine years 
the following is a tweet from brad jaffy of nbc nightly news containing the new fbi recommendation 
the new investigation into the clinton camp will most certainly spark new paytoplay allegations  as the new fbi revelations also comes days after a project veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the democratic consultant robert creamer of democracy partners discussed ways to commit largescale voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at donald trump rallies out of creamers  visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky some  times white house visitor records show that schakowsky took  private meetings with obama or his senior staff also over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability caught on film  robert creamer resigns over a massive democratic party controversy image source cnn  creamer a convicted felon  in  creamer plead guilty  million in bank fraud and tax violations was promptly shoved out of the hillary clinton campaigns inner circle following a heavily publicized video sting revealing his discussion about voter fraud and violence at trump rallies pay to play virginia governor terry mcauliffe closely allied with the clintons negotiated a a campaign contribution involving the fbi image source new republic  it remains unclear what exactly reopened the new clinton probe but perhaps the fbi had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime clinton associate  virginia gov terry mcauliffe  helped steer  to the election campaign of the wife of an fbi official who went on to lead the probe into hillary clintons use of a private email system according to a report the ny post also reported on the matter this past week 
the political action committee of mcauliffe the clinton loyalist gave  to the state senate campaign of the wife of andrew mccabe who is now deputy director of the fbi according to the wall street journal  
the report states jill mccabe received an additional  from the virginia democratic party which is heavily influenced by mcauliffe 
the money directed by mcauliffe began flowing two months after the fbi investigation into clinton began in july  around that time the candidates husband was promoted from running the washington field office for the fbi to the no  position at the bureau 
in a cnn report from october th a week before the mcauliffe revelations according to notes from interviews conducted during an fbi investigation into clintons email practices undersecretary of state patrick kennedy personally tried to convince fbi officials that the email should be declassified one interviewee described feeling pressured by another fbi official at kennedys request 
the newly reopened fbi investigation into clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above but theres no doubt that due to public backlash the fbi received following the first clinton investigation in addition to concerns over dealings between the fbi and clinton associates  the agency needed to save face 
it remains to be seen how new case will impact the us presidential election

2,fbi redux whats behind new probe into hillary clinton emails,"a tidal wave of revelations is pouring out of the clinton campaign as the  presidential election draws to a close 
meltdown the clinton campaign continues to unravel following a series of troubling details photo illustration wire 
over the weekend it was discovered through a wikileaks email dump that neera tanden of the center for american progress  john podesta s top aide had an email exchange with michael lux of progressive strategies revealing that the democratic consultant robert creamer of democracy partners was closely allied with clinton campaign manager robby mook  
political bombshell clinton campaign manager robby mook had close ties to disgraced dnc consultant robert creamer image source lockerdome  
creamer gained national attention when he became the subject of video sting operation captured by the investigative nonprofit project veritas  not only was it revealed that the creamer discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at donald trump rallies on camera  he also met with white house officials some  times over the past year including  private meetings with president obama or other senior officials 
dnc scandal robert creamer of democracy partners and democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky image source national vanguard  
creamers visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky  
white house visitor records have shown that schakowsky took  private meetings with obama or his senior staff over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  potentially giving the clinton campaign and the dnc plausible deniability 
the mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim dnc chair donna brazile  is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two  town hall debates brazile stepped down from her role at cnn earlier in october heres a passage from the daily caller describing the scenario 
donna brazile the interim chair of the democratic national committee began providing town hall and debate questions to the clinton campaign earlier than previously known emails released by wikileaks on monday show 
the article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim dnc chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined 
in the march  exchange brazile mentions roland martin by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign 
ill send a few more though some questions roland submitted brazile wrote to palmieri in the march  email thread which is entitled from time to time i get the questions in advance 
martin is a commentator for tv one and the host of news one now  as well as a cnn contributor 
in another matter the wall street journal revealed the following  while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the fbi and doj while the fbi appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments 
the latest development began in early october when new yorkbased fbi officials notified andrew mccabe of the terry mcauliffe campaign contribution scandal the bureaus secondincommand that while investigating mr weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor they had recovered a laptop many of the  emails on the computer they said were from the accounts of ms abedin according to people familiar with the matter 
some critics have called for mccabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received  from a wellknown clinton confidant terry mcauliffe  this was further underlined after the house oversight commitee wanted more information about the senate campaign of dr jill mccabe and its ties to the clintons 
the alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when attorney general loretta lynch and deputy attorney general sally yates objected to fbi director james comey reopening the clinton email server case this past week  something that added to the lynchclinton tarmac meeting before the first fbi ruling in the clinton case 
according to a report filed by zero hedge  a close friend of podesta peter kadzik  the assistant attorney general of the department of justice doj will be in charge of a probe into huma abedin  clintions closest aide 
interestingly as a mountain of controversy envelops the clinton campaign the fbi is now conducting an early inquiry into former trump campaign manager paul manafort  over his alleged foreign business connections 
back in august the following business connection was revealed by nbc news  
in  according to court records senior trump aide paul manaforts firm was involved with a ukrainian oligarch named dmytro firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous new york hotel the drake the total value of the project was  million firtashs company planned to invest over  million the records say 
that same year firtash acknowledged to the us ambassador in ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious russian crime lord according to a classified state department cable other cables say firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between russia and the ukraine 
although the us state department has determined that firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in russia  so far theres nothing directly linking manafort to any underground element at this time 
watch this space  as the russiatrump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the clinton campaign meltdown

robert creamer the operative behind sending provocateurs to donald trump rallies was close to robby mook hillary clintons campaign manager according to new emails released by wikileaks 
creamer who allegedly spearheaded the dirty tricks for the democrats wasnt just consulting for the democratic national committee according to videos made by project veritas he was sending people to provoke trump at events 
creamer has thus become a redhot issue in the campaign and now its apparent he is close to mook that surprising detail came out sunday morning when wikileaks posted hundreds more emails from john podestas gmail account podesta is clintons campaign chairman whose account was hacked in march

3,party corruption clinton campaign directly tied to disgraced dnc consultant,"november   by wire  comments 
patrick henningsen st century wire 
the longer this soap opera drags on its becoming more and more evident that the russian government did not hack into the dnc and moscow is not feeding john podestas emails to wikileaks for those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory this might be a hard pill to swallow 
the white house and the hillary clinton campaign are now married to the idea that putin is hacking the us elections in response the president is weighing his options  tougher economic sanctions revoking diplomatic status to russian envoys in the us or even deploying his newly developed malicious cyberactivity tools 
even vp joe biden wants in on the action threatening moscow by sayingwere sending a message we have the capacity to do it 
it seems that where ever you turn nowadays someone in washington is issuing a threat against russia are usrussian relations really that bad or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the us 
what was previously a stance reserved for rightwing neoconservative hawks and cold war holdouts has now infected americas leftwing and is a firm plank in the democratic party platform as evidenced by hillary clintons constant antirussian rhetoric throughout this  election cycle along with the white house clinton has now transformed the democrats into the vanguard of washingtons new antirussia movement 
on july th josh rogin from the washington post wrote the clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on russia after trump suggested wednesday that if russia had indeed hacked clintons private email server it should release the emails the clinton campaign sent out its democratic surrogates to bash russia and trump in a manner traditionally reserved for republicans 
anyone who was paying attention back then knew this russian hack talking point was purely political but then again whos really paying attention these days certainly not the us media 
you can trace the genesis of the democratic partys hardcore antirussian strategy back to when president vladimir putin made a mild passing remark about donald trumps gop primary success from that point on trumps political opponents saw this as an open target in their words comparing one dictator to another 
never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points president obama got in on the act intensifying the trumpputin narrative to the level of bromance  if youve made a career out of idealizing ronald reagan then where were you when your own partys nominee for president was kissing up to vladimir putin said obama on oct th at a clinton rally in miami 
backed by the obama white house clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming russia  not only for the controversial dnc leaks but also for hacking into us election systems in arizona  a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation the medias coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset in a leading news release entitled  russian hackers targeted arizona election system  we can see how after the cocksure headline the first paragraph would always sound definitive 
hackers targeted voter registration systems in illinois and arizona and the fbi alerted arizona officials in june that russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state 
but then by the time you advanced down the story the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty 
the bureau described the threat as credible and significant an eight on a scale of one to  matt roberts a spokesman for arizona secretary of state michele reagan r said monday as a result reagan shut down the states voter registration system for nearly a week 
and then down to almost nothing 
it turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system they had however stolen the username and password of a single election official in gila county 
at no point was any evidence ever given only ambiguous statements like cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a russian governmentdirected hack 
are american politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their shortterm political ambitions better yet has american political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac translated in french bottom of the bag where politicians in power are so insecure as to makeup and propagate wild international conspiracy theories  in the middle a national election cycle its a very depressing prospect and yet this is exactly what we are seeing in this  presidential election 
behind clintons wild hyperbolic rants about the kremlin and wikileaks you will find the white house 
on october th the obama administration formally accused the russian government of stealing emails from the democratic national committee and other highprofile individuals including hillary clintons campaign manager john podesta  giving them to wikileaks 
soon there was a queue of national security politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon senator ben sasse ner a member of the homeland security committee spouted out russia must face serious consequences moscow orchestrated these hacks because russian president vladimir putin believes sovietstyle aggression is worth it the united states must upend putins calculus with a strong diplomatic political cyber and economic response 
according to a washington post report by technology editor ellen nakashima  the only evidence that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged russian government hacks provided by a us cyber security company called crowdstrike  no actual specifics are given so we are meant to take private firm crowdstrikes word for it 
image crowdstrike cyber security 
the posts nakashima then added 
the administration also blamed moscow for the hack of the democratic congressional campaign committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of democratic lawmakers 
an online persona calling himself guccifer  has claimed responsibility for posting the material those sites and that persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts the joint statement said  we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities 
moscows press secretarys reply this is some sort of nonsense said dmitry peskov 
despite the constant repetition by democrat media surrogates and as cnns maria cardona said last night no us national intelligence agency has really confirmed that russia was behind the email hacks  and still no evidence  other than speculative guesswork has been presented 
likewise us intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that russia did it thus leaving the door open to walkback the accusation at a later date standard washington procedure of ambiguity this little detail doesnt seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though it seems that the white house hillary clinton and media operatives like cardona  are quite happy living in what john kerry recent dubbed as a  parallel universe  
still during the final presidential debate hillary clinton proudly crowed how   us intelligence agencies  aka the intelligence community all agreed that russia did it 
the announcement albeit vague actually originated from the office of the director of national intelligence 
we have  intelligence agencies civilian and military who have all concluded that these espionage attacks these cyberattacks come from the highest levels of the kremlin and they are designed to influence our election said clinton i find that deeply disturbing 
whats even more disturbing is the fact that clinton is lying in front of a national audience the highest levels of the kremlin here are clintons  agencies 
air force intelligence army intelligence central intelligence agency coast guard intelligence defense intelligence agency energy department homeland security department state department treasury department drug enforcement administration federal bureau of investigation marine corps intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency national reconnaissance office national security agency navy intelligence and the office of the director of national intelligence 
what does the coast guard intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency or the drug enforcement administration know about john podestas emails answer nothing 
the exact same thing happened following wikileaks first trove of dnc emails back in july   the us government issued a vague accusatory statement but would not actually name the culprit some might call that propaganda 
in both instances the obama administration refused to present any evidence translated there was no evidence if there had been the white house would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the un over washingtons flagging efforts in syria both obama administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for democrats and journalists working for hopelessly partisan outlets like new york times and cnn  none of whom have bothered to press the white house for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the partys decree that russian is hacking the us election process if you actually look at the joint dnidhs statement issued on the matter it contains no definitive statement  the hacks are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the us election process such activity is not new to moscow  the russians have used similar tactics and techniques across europe and eurasia for example to influence public opinion there we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities according to nsa intelligence workerturned whistleblower william binney  when asked about wikileaks and whether the russians are hacking us elections he concluded that the cyber efforts against the dnc were more likely to be the work of a  disgruntled us intelligence worker  
under partisan pressure from senior democrat senator harry reid  the fbi also initiated another investigation into people linked to the trump team with russia reid was unset about the dnc hacks and the podesta emails and demanded the fbi do something about the trump campaign to date the fbi havent come up with anything 
to be fair hillary would have every reason to believe that the kremlin is behind the hack  because her staff read it to her from the campaigns daily intelligence briefings presumably supplied from the us governments much vaunted intelligence community  of course thats the same intelligence community that briefed george w bush about saddams nonexistent nuclear weapons program and who also briefed colin powell about iraqs imaginary winnebagos of death aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior doublewide camper vans so of course they would know if putin directed the dnc leaks and podesta email hacks 
for those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as washington intelligence i can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now no that was iraq that was bush were not like that no this time its different this time we are sure the russians did it 
in  obama claimed that kims notorious bureau  hacked into sony pictures 
this isnt the first time that president obama has cried wolf on a foreign hack and then tried to sell it for political purposes back in december  obama claimed that north korea had hacked sony pictures in hollywood pentagoncia media proxy cnn quickly chimed in to support washingtons conspiracy theory floating a colorful story that kim jingun had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called  bureau   just like with todays russian hack theory no member of the mainstream press dared to question the white houses ridiculous north korean claim and like the russian hack claims the only source cited for sony hack was analysis provided by us firm crowdstrike  
jumping the shark 
after their democratic party convention on july th the clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their putin narrative 
soon after a cadre of top clinton national security surrogates then accused trump of emboldening russia in their evil plot to destabilize and dominate the west tom donilon a former national security adviser then accused russia of interfering with elections all over europe and then accused trump is helping russia directly at that point they were in too deep to turn back the biggest impact of wikileaks  shining a spotlight on russias attempt to undermine american democracy and trumps refusal to condemn it httpstcoalzpymbb 
 josh schwerin joshschwerin october   
clinton spin doctors josh schwerin and michael fallon would stoop even lower by accusing rt of having possession of the podesta emails even before wikileaks did their only evidence seemed to be twitter posts by rt news which clinton held up as proof that the kremlin was frontrunning wikileaks email dumps the clinton braintrust failed to note that the podesta emails were posted on wikileaks own website well before rt news had tweeted about them at that point it became obvious that the clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on we then watched as one rt reporter after another dismantled the clinton campaigns desperate claims it was embarrassing 
they could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was wikileaks head julian assange who chose the timing of the release of the dnc and podesta emails rather than attack assange himself who happens to be popular with millennials the very group clinton struggles to connect with her operatives opted to target russia and trump instead 
either way the political strategy here is clear  to shoot the messenger  the clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rearguard mode because based on the content of both the dnc leaks wikileaks files and project veritas video  their own democratic party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization 
their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from democrats and their mainstream media surrogates none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity the results speak for themselves the initial dnc leak of  emails resulted in the resignation of dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz  they revealed the unthinkable the democratic national committee actively worked to undermine the presidential campaign of bernie sanders in favor of the establishment choice in hillary clinton sanders never had a chance honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process while party insiders and clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened 
to prove this point both president obama and hillary clinton then gave wassermanschultz a glowing endorsement on the way out for the last eight years chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz has had my back this afternoon i called her to let her know that i am grateful said obama not surprisingly clinton thanked wasserman schultz presumably for helping to knock her only competitor sanders out of the democrat primary race i am grateful to debbie for getting the democratic party to this years historic convention in philadelphia and i know that this weeks events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership said clinton 
the party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it 
party meltdown 
wasserman schultzs replacement didnt fair much better dnc vice chairwoman donna brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election but brazile was soon skewered by subsequent wikileaks batches  showing how on more than one occasion she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives  straight to hillary clinton 
 a march  email exchange shows brazile stating that she received a town hall question from roland martin a tv one host who comoderated a march  town hall with cnns jake tapper 
 a march  email shows that she shared a question with clinton campaign chairman john podesta and communications director jennifer palmieri that was to be asked in a march  debate hosted by cnn in flint mich source daily caller  
braziles audacious fraud also helped contribute to her partys planned sabotage of democrat challenger bernie sanders watch brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here 
 completely corrupt and still brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on fox news last week braziles reputation is so bad now that even cnn has severed ties with her  and thats saying a lot 
in addition it was also revealed how cnns head political commentator gloria borger  was named by podesta as one of a shortlist of journalists the clinton campaign would work with to gain favorable coverage youd think that cnn would have dropped borger after this was revealed but no amazingly borger is still leading cnns election coverage 
clearly cnn cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with hillary clinton and the democratic party everunbiased cnns gloria borger refers to being in gop hell and says shell reach out soon to podesta heartwarming podestaemails pictwittercomcqfdcjq 
 lb hacker owens nubianawakening october   
worse than watergate 
perhaps a bigger scandal which the obama white house and clinton campaign operatives would like to bury  is the fbis investigation into the clinton foundation yesterday the wall street journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the fbi and the justice department over whether or not to pursue an investigation into clinton issue 
some investigators grew frustrated viewing fbi leadership as uninterested in probing the charity these people said others involved disagreed sharply defending fbi bosses and saying mr mccabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the justice department and fbi agents pursuing the clinton foundation case it isnt unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited but the internal debates about the clinton foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president 
theres more it was also revealed last week how jill mccabe the wife of fbi deputy director andrew mccabe  received  in campaign funds in late  for her virginia state senate run this unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by virginia govterry mcauliffe  a clinton foundation board member after the funds were donated andrew mccabe was then put in charge of the clinton email case in normal times this one scandal would be bigger than watergate but these are not normal times  
so why is washington going all out to deflect to russia  and coverup the clinton scandals and the wikileaks document dumps one reason is because the clinton email issue goes all the way to the top  to the president himself 
what wire reported on oct st is how president obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of hillarys unauthorized private server obama told cbs news on march   that he only found out about clintons server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports the presidents lie was confirmed when newly released fbi documents showed that 
obama used a pseudonym bobamaameritechnet when communicating with thensecretary of state hillary clinton by email and at least one of those emails ended up on clintons private email server 
so not only did obama lie on national tv but he also broke strict white house security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails off grid with hillary clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server  maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system who knows why he did it 
sure hes not the first us president to lie but like richard nixon and bill clinton obama just joined that exclusive liars club  caught out lying to the american people 
on top of this any communications made by the president of the united states are de facto labeled as  born classified  the same goes for any state department communications with other foreign ministers 
coverup john podesta and huma abedin on the hillary campaign jet image abc news  
it should be well known by now after watching both attorney generals eric holder and loretta lynch in action  that the obama justice department doj is one of the most politicized in history bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the hillary email case 
on friday fbi director james comey set the election alight after announcing that the fbi would be reopening the clinton email case  currently examining  emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former us congressman anthony weiner estranged husband of top clinton aid and longtime confidant huma abedin who was snared in a sexting scandal allegedly involving a underaged female so which doj person is in charge of this investigation none other than assistant attorney general peter j kadzik  who is kadzik zero hedge reports 
oh yes recall our post from last week  clinton campaign chair had dinner with top doj official one day after hillarys benghazi hearing  in which we reported that john podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked doj officials the very day after hillary clintons benghazi testimony it was peter kadzik 
oh and if that wasnt good enough kadzik was also podestas lawyer back in  when ken starr was investigating podesta over his role in helping bill clinton internmistress monica lewinsky land a job at the united nations the two were described as best friends fox news confirms 
fantastic lawyer kept me out of jail podesta wrote on sept   to obama aide cassandra butts according to emails hacked from podestas gmail account and posted by wikileaks 
to call the clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement and on the whole americans are sick of it 
russia  the party scapegoat 
former democratic party leader howard dean was so incensed about the fbi reopening the case he accused the fbi director of being in league with russia tweeting ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin 
 howard dean govhowarddean october   
another veteran party operative and lifetime clinton defender james carville  was so upset by the fbi announcement that he accused the kgb working with republicans to hijack the election during his wild rant on msnbc  
i think this an outrage and i think the fact that the kgb is involved in this election is an outrage and i think the american people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for comey thats what i think said carville 
maybe someone can remind carville that there is no kgb  and that the soviet union actually dissolved in  
these are just a few scandals surrounding the democratic party and the clinton campaign along with the many exposés revealed through wikileaks and the podesta email batches those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence  unlike the russians hacking the dnc and john podesta and passing those to wikileaks 
suffice to say the democratic party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning wikileaks material and also blame donald trump in the process it should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised hillary clinton over the finish line on november th the washington establishment has concocted the story that putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the us theyve tried to lay this at the feet of donald trump who obama and clinton claim has some secret special relationship with vladimir putin the liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point and antirussian war hawks on the republican side love it too for the white house and the clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep  a perfect double entendre  
the geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold first this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against russia secondly the us could continue to lean on russia in the un over syria previously wire reported how washingtons state dept and un delegations led by the dynamic trio of john kerry  samantha power  and john kirby  already lied when levelling charges against russia for war crimes in aleppo and again while accusing russia and syria of conducting an airstrike on a un aid convoy in syria as we have already shown  that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of usbacked rebels al nusra front or nour aldin alzenki 
with so much at stake geopolitically why would washington lie about a potential world war iii trigger event if they are prepared to lie about this what else are they prepared to lie about 
the demonization of all things russian has definitely accelerated since late  when the us engineered a coup detat in kiev ukraine ever since that its been a goto talking point for ginningup and new transaltlantic arms race as with republican war hawks  and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection like clinton and the democrats when the new year rang in  the newly appointed head of the us broadcasting board of governors andrew lack announced the new challenges facing americas own staterun media arm that includes us overseas propaganda assets including voice of america radio free europeradio liberty the middle east broadcasting networks and radio free asia lack said  we are facing a number of challenges from entities like russia today which is out there pushing a point of view the islamic state in the middle east and groups like boko haram he was forced to resign shortly after that 
whats clear is that when it comes to all things russian there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this us administration the list is too long to chronicle here although  russianbacked rebles shootting down mh  and  assad regime sarin attack in damascus in   certainly comes to mind 
that said its hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the russia government a world nuclear power and member of the unsc of hacking into the us electoral process when you examine history however what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the us government and the cia have altered and flipped  foreign elections throughout history the attempted assassination of over  foreign leaders  knowing all this one might find it hard to take seriously washingtons claims that putin and trump are trying manipulate the  election 
on oct   russian foreign minister sergei lavrov laid it all on the table 
we have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive russophobia that now lies at the heart of us policy towards russia its not just a rhetorical russophobia but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security 
selfserving career political operatives in washington are playing a dangerous game history will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the obamaclinton era 
knowing what we now know about the nsa and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone anywhere  if washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from maybe they could start there far be it from anyone in washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry 
still were waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in washington  before its too late

shawn helton st century wire 
the cozy relationship between goldman sachs and the clintons has reached dizzying new heights in recent years giving the democratic party nominee hillary clinton an immensely influential partner on wall street 
as the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened fbi probe into the hillary clinton s email server case  the global investment banking firm goldman sachs quietly endorsed the democratic presidential candidate this past week 
the financial ties that bind the clintons and wall street banks like goldman sachs are nothing new but never before have the connections been so exposed lets take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long ago 
money changers wall streets goldman sachs are inextricably linked to the clintons and the clinton foundation photo illustration wire 
the clintons  goldman sachs 
while campaigning for his first term in the white house former president bill clinton received an enormous amount of support from washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on wall street 
at the top of the pile sat goldman sachs 
in  the la times reported that presidential nominee bill clinton received the largest share of his financial supportat least  millionfrom lawyers and lobbyists and that clinton also received additional support from big securities firms such as goldman sachs  co in new york and stephens inc in his hometown of little rock ark in fact goldman sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm  
for decades the clintons have remained close allies to the banking behemoth goldman sachs and in the process a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold something that even the ny times admits 
over plus years goldman provided the clintons with some of their most influential advisers millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees and financial support for the family foundations charitable programs 
by now there should be little doubt that the clinton political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the wall street banking cartel their relationship was built over three decades 
the real watershed moment came here 
blank check bill clinton laughs with wall street elites after signing the financial services modernization act in  
key to the kingdom 
in one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era the clinton presidency gave big banks like goldman sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely 
the clintongoldman sachswall street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the glasssteagall act  which banking luminaries cynically named the  financial services modernization act of  officially titled the gramm leachbliley act  the original glasssteagall was a depressionage fourpart provision under the bank act of  that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors  the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the great depression  in fact the grammleachbliley act which repealed glasssteagall opened the door for the shadow banking realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk as banks became more interlinked 
simply put clintons repeal of glasssteagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking  which exposed everyone to toxic subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite  which ultimately causing the global economy to crash in  all that can be laid at the feet of one william jefferson clinton and hillary still claims that my husband did so well with the economy really 
in a crossposted article featured at huffington post  nomi prins underscored the complicit nature of wall street and washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the clinton administration during the s 
to grasp the dangers that the big six banks jpmorgan chase citigroup bank of america wells fargo goldman sachs and morgan stanley presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world you need to understand their history in washington starting with the clinton years of the s alliances established then not exclusively with democrats since bankers are bipartisan by nature enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital rest assured of one thing their past and present ceos will prove as critical in backing a hillary clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husbands years in office 
prins herself was a former managing director at goldman sachs senior managing director at bear stearns as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm lehman brothers following the financial crash in  prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled  it takes a pillage  behind the bonuses bailouts and backroom deals from washington to wall street 
prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the glasssteagall act since departing from the investment banking world 
the media outlet common dreams described the merger between citicorp and travelers group becoming citigroup which was dubbed the cititravelers act on capitol hill it was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the clinton administrations influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of glasssteagall 
then in  in an act of corporate civil disobedience citicorp and travelers group announced they were merging such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the bank holding company act  but was excused due to a loophole that provided a twoyear review period of proposed mergers the merger was premised on the expectation that glasssteagall would be repealed citigroups cochairs sandy weill and john reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of congress to make sure a deal was cut 
at the time it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal  as stated by the former bankers of america ceo kenneth guenther  in   after  attempts in  years congress passed the financial services modernization act  which led to the repeal of glasssteagall 
the repeal of glasssteagall was pushed heavily by citigroups coceo sanford weill and lobbyist roger levy and according to a report by the nation  
they laid out more than  million for lobbying in  according to the center for responsive politics and donated more than  million in the  election cyclea figure sure to be topped in  
how much of those contributions made their way to the clinton family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the white house 
in  bill clinton was paid over half a million for speaking at three private goldman events 
in  after stepping down from her position as secretary of state hillary clinton gave a total of three paid speeches at goldman sachs events to the tune of  dollars in which one attendee said s he sounded more like a goldman sachs managing director according to a quote obtained by politico  indeed clinton gave a glowing speech to the goldman gang and in the process as wikileaks released in early october  the democratic nominee believes in both a public and a private position on wall street reform and that it is an  oversimplification to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis 
that clinton leak provided another window into the much protected alliance between finance and politics but its only the tip of a much larger iceberg 
in  the washington post reported that hillary rodham clinton and former president bill clinton earned in excess of  million for delivering  speeches since the beginning of  a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid

the clinton family is chockfull of banking connections as chelsea clinton joined the avenue capital group which according to reports is a  billion hedge fund whose founder has contributed to many democratic party campaigns chelsea is married to marc mezvinsky  a former investment banker for goldman sachs chelseas tenure at avenue capital group was from  just prior to hillary clintons run for president in  since then chelsea has risen to vice chairman inside the clinton foundation 
marc mezvinsky was forced to close one of his hedge funds recently eaglevale hellenic opportunity  after had the fund lost most of its initial investor funds of  million  after blowing the money on secondhand junk greek bank stocks and toxic government debt 
the apple doesnt fall far from the tree 
as it turns out marc is the son of troubled former congressman ed mezvinsky  another close friend of team clinton 
politico reports on one of ed mezvinskys financial controversies in  
in the waning days of clintons presidency federal prosecutors and the fbi were bearing down on former rep ed mezvinsky diowa who had fallen for a series of ponzi schemes and pulled in nearly  million money from other investors to cover his losses

goldman sachs will pay  billion to settle federal and state probes into the banks sale of mortgagebacked securities before the financial crisis the justice department announced monday 
authorities said goldman misrepresented the quality of loans it securitized and then sold to investors ahead of the housing bubble and  crisis the settlement includes a  billion civil penalty  billion in relief payouts to underwater homeowners and affected borrowers and  million to resolve various other claims 
this resolution holds goldman sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail acting associate attorney general stuart delery said in a statement  
in  a bloomberg article questioned how goldman managed to survive and even thrive during the  economic crisis 
whether goldman could have gone the way of lehman brothers or merrill lynch remains the subject of much debate goldman maintains that it did not need or want the  billion bailout that hank paulson  former goldman alum pushed on it and other firms in october  but the fact remains that when the federal reserve allowed goldman and morgan stanleybut not lehman brothersto become bank holding companies on sept   goldman was able three days later to raise  billion in equity  billion from the public and another  billion from investor warren buffett that would probably not have happened without the feds expedited decision and support a week later morgan stanley saved itself from bankruptcy when it negotiated a  billion equity investment from mitsubishi ufj financial group 
all told the clinton friendly investment giant goldman sachs after making record profits became the fifth megabank ordered to pay billions to the department of justice after the financial crash of  in addition the firm was ordered to pay  billion to the federal housing finance agency in   not including pending private lawsuits levied on the firm since the great recession 
in a new york review article goldman sachs was already under investigation for committing fraud at least a year before the economic crash in  
data gathered mostly from the corporate research project  a public interest website show that on thirteen occasions between  and  goldman was penalized by us courts or government agencies for fraudulent or deceptive practices that were committed mostly between  and  
cashing out bill clinton with his top economic strategist robert rubin image source st louis postdispatch  
wall street selects team clinton 
the clinton connection to goldman sachs emerged in the early s as robert rubin  a former senior partner with goldman with a year tenure with the firm joined former president clintons economic policy team later becoming secretary of the treasury in  around that time the clinton presidency ushered in soaring tax hikes under the rubinomics banner aka clintonomics the plan raised taxes on most americans specifically the middle class  in what was said to be the largest increase in american history at the time 
according to congressional record  vol part   in  the economy grew at a sickly   clintons vetoes of spending cuts insured continued deficits well into the st century 
in a multinational monitor report entitled wall streets best investment ten deregulatory steps to financial meltdown by robert weissman and james donahue  a clearer picture of the financial collusion spawned in the s under the clinton administration was revealed 
during the clinton administration treasury secretary robert rubin who had run goldman sachs enthusiastically promoted the legislation in a  testimony before the house banking committee for example rubin argued that the banking industry is fundamentally different from what it was two decades ago let alone in   us banks generally engage in a broader range of securities activities abroad than is permitted domestically even domestically the separation of investment banking and commercial banking envisioned by glasssteagall has eroded significantly 
with a pedigree that included goldman sachs the council on foreign relations cfr the brookings institution and the bilderberg group  robert rubin emerged in  as the vice chairman at citigroup  after overseeing its merger as well as helping to craft the repeal of glasssteagall while serving as secretary of treasury rubin made a fortune with citigroup causing sharp criticism in media and from those within the financial sector following the  crash heres a passage from bloomberg regarding rubin in the aftermath of the banking collapse 
when it collapsed due in part to bankfriendly policies that rubin advocated he made more than  million while others lost everything you have to view people in a fair light says phil angelides cochair of the financial crisis inquiry commission who credits rubin for much of the clintonera prosperity but on the other side of the ledger are key acts such as the deregulation of derivatives or stopping the commodities futures trading commission from regulating derivatives that in the end weakened our financial system and exposed us to the risk of financial disaster 
sworn fbi director james comey sworn in by former doj head eric holder image source thewhitehousespin  
under the microscope 
over the summer wire observed some curious connections between the clinton foundation and fbi director james comey  as well as his questionable handling of other cases related to the clinton family heres the following passage to consider in light of the new information related to the clinton investigation 
many will also be unaware that before comey was installed by the obama administration as fbi director he was on the board of director at hsbc bank  a bank implicated in international money laundering  including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels forbes also points out where comey was also at the key chokepoint during the case involving dodgy auditor kpmg which followed on by the hsbc criminal case 
if comey and his boss attorney general alberto gonzalez had made a different decision about kpmg back in  kpmg would not have been around to miss all the illegal acts hsbc and standard chartered scbff  were committing on its watch bloomberg reported in  that back in june of  comey was the man thrust into the position of deciding whether kpmg would live or die for its criminal tax shelter violations 
in  the guardian discussed the financial relationship between hsbc and the clinton foundation receiving a startling  million in donations from clients of the large bank 
the charitable foundation run by hillary clinton and her family has received as much as m from wealthy international donors who were clients of hsbcs controversial swiss bank 
leaked files from hsbcs swiss banking division reveal the identities of seven donors to the bill hillary and chelsea clinton foundation with accounts in geneva 
a new update on the fbi investigation into the clinton foundation was announced over the last  hours in addition the recently reopened clinton email probe from last week it remains to be seen how indepth this new investigation will be 
to call it collusion would be an understatement when looking back at the financial affairs of the clintons goldman sachs and others on wall street  its clearer than ever that what we are looking at is a criminal syndicate

this should be the biggest revelation yet from wikileaks already epic email trove will the us media cover this story 
last night in an rt exclusive interview conducted by awardwinning filmmaker john pilger wikileaks editor and founder julian assange described what he believes is the most significant email in the whole collection 
wikileaks reveals an early  email where the outgoing secretary of state hillary clinton was urging john podesta  then advisor to president barack obama to bring pressure on gulf states saudi arabia and qatar which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isil islamic state is isis and other radical sunni groups 
this constitutes proof that the clinton foundation knowingly accepting millions of dollars in charitable donations from the same gulf states which both secretary clinton and president obama knew were funding isis al nusra front al qaeda in syria and known takfiri terrorist fighting organizations 
in addition the clintons foundation took money from a number of other gulf monarchies 
infographic conservative post  
this latest news validates what wire has been saying since the isis crisis began in june  
according to fox news  fbi sources have said that indictments are likely for the clinton foundation investigation one only wonders how this latest assange revelation will factor into the wider investigation  as it goes right to the heart of the national security and foreign policy  two things which clinton trades heavily on in her campaigning 
assange went on to explain the deep ramifications of this latest criminal allegation against clinton and her family foundation 
all serious analysts know and even the us government has agreed that some saudi figures have been supporting isis and funding isis but the dodge has always been that it is some rogue princes using their oil money to do whatever they like but actually the government disapproves but that email says that it is the government of saudi arabia and the government of qatar that have been funding isis 
during their minute interview filmed at the ecuadorian embassy in london assange and pilger discussed the obvious conflict of interest between clinton as secretary of state the clinton foundation and gulf monarchies who financed them the following is an excerpt from the interview transcript 
john pilger the saudis the qataris the moroccans the bahrainis particularly the first two are giving all this money to the clinton foundation while hillary clinton is secretary of state and the state department is approving massive arms sales particularly saudi arabia 
julian assange under hillary clinton  and the clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it  the biggestever arms deal in the world was made with saudi arabia more than  billion during her tenure the total arms exports from the us doubled in dollar value 
jp of course the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group called isil or isis is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the clinton foundation

6,wikileaks hillary clinton knew saudi qatar were funding isis  but still took their money for foundation,"st century wire says 
yesterday wikileaks editor and founder julian assange confirmed what wire already knew  that hillary clinton and the obama white houses claim of the us election process being hacked by the russian government was a desperate work of fiction not content with that fish tale hillary clinton took the narrative to an embarrassing new low if that was even possible with another wilder madeup conspiracy story about the russians 
the following statement made by hillary clinton yesterday epitomizes the term  jumping the shark  its time for trump to answer serious questions about his ties to russia httpstcodosmyvar pictwittercomdryempjx 
 hillary clinton hillaryclinton october   
apparently hillary clintons campaign staff fed her a planted online news story by the clinton campaign which ran on a questionable prodemocratic party online news outlet on monday the slate ran the story by one of its alleged journalists named franklin foer  complete with a clickbait bloglike headline was a trump server communicating with russia 
whatever legitimacy the slate had before last night just evaporated 
john roberts from forbes explains the bottom line is that slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season as for foer he says on twitter a follow up piece is in the works 
roberts rightly points out that the only followup story for this lemon should start with the word retraction 
cyber feud assange believes clinton has gone beyond the pale with her russian conspiracy obsession 
during his exclusive interview with awardwinning filmmaker john pilger when asked what he thought of hillary clintons shrill antics julian assange said  i actually feel quite sorry for hillary clinton as a person because i see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions tormented literally to the point where they become sick 
the saddest thing about this and the other dishonest and destructive actions of the clinton campaign and the democratic party  is that no one in the party seems to see anything wrong with this level of deceit and dishonesty like hillary clinton in her sociopathic path to power the party rank and file are acting like a cult coven following their high priestess 
still clinton surrogates in the media are trying to equate clinton simultaneously scapegoating and baiting another nuclear superpower  with a decadeold misogynist hot mic audio excerpt of donald trump in a tmzstyle tabloid sting that pretty much sums up democratic party strategy for this election season 
assange was right clinton the democratic party and their surrogate are eating themselves such are the spoils of power in washington that men and women will do and say anything to have it

over the past months hillary clinton the obama white house and the mainstream media have been promoting the conspiracy theory that  russia is hacking the us election  blaming moscow for the wikileaks emails the dnc leaks and for allegedly hacking us voting systems despite the grand accusations no evidence or proof has been offered by the us government 
it goes without saying how damaging the democratic partys crazed witch hunt has been to usrussian relations where clinton has led the antirussian crusade and demonizing president vladimir putin at every opportunity 
todays stunning presidential victory by donald trump means that all eyes are now on putin to see how moscow and washington will be interfacing going forward 
with such sensitive geopolitical issues like syria and the ukraine currently in play what happens between the two leaders over the coming months could set the tone going forward 
in a message to donald trump russian president vladimir putin has expressed confidence that the dialogue between moscow and washington in keeping with each others views meets the interests of both russia and the us 
putin also expressed hope over the joint efforts on bringing russianamerican relations out of their current crisis 
the russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some burning issues that are currently on the international agenda and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security ria novosti reported 
on top of it putin has expressed confidence that building a constructive dialogue between moscow and washington based on principles of equality mutual respect and each others positions meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community 
according to many observers usrussia relations are now at their lowest point since the cold war putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of russias relations with the us was not our choice however 
for things to improve between moscow and washington the us should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect russias interests rather than try to dictate terms putin said last month 
we are concerned with the deterioration of russianamerican relations but that was not our choice we never wanted that on the contrary we want to have friendly relations with the us a great country and a leading economy putin said at an economic forum in moscow

one of the great myths being spun by the establishment media was that donald trump had no support from women latinos and blacks in the us as it turned out this was a lie propagated in a failed attempt to margnalize republican voters and give a false impression of a liberal democratic mandate in america in the end trump gathered  of latinos  of african americans and  of college educated white women for months mainstream media pundits and polls insisted that all of these demographics were exclusively for hillary clinton how could they have got it so wrong 
psychologist and intenet radio personality kiki green explains how blacks were conned into voting for hillary clinton by the partnership between the democratic party hollywood and the clinton campaign  by cynically using celebrities like beyonce jay z and katie perry

antitrump street protests linked to the soros funded organization moveonorg have cascaded across the nation for the third day following the  presidential election result 
mainstream media outlets like cnn and msnbc have given the protests aroundtheclock media coverage drowning out all other news stories including a successful transition meeting between the president elect and president barack obama

the free thought project weighed in on the new developments concerning a series of centrally coordinated antitrump protests organized in part by by the george soros ngo moveon 
washington dc  billionaire globalist financier george soros moveonorg has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of donald trump  exposing the protests to largely be an organized topdown operation  and not an organic movement of concerned americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media 
wednesday saw protests in the streets of at least  major us cities chicago new york los angeles philadelphia boston washington dc portland ore st paul minn seattle  and several other cities saw protests according to usa today 
in light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of trump a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether its an organic grassroots movement or something much more organized sophisticated and potentially dangerous 
soros affiliated organization moveonorg released the following press release yesterday afternoon 
americans to come together in hundreds peaceful gatherings of solidarity resistance and resolve following election results 
hundreds of americans dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the white house and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny racism islamophobia and xenophobia 
tonight thousands of americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation including outside the white house following the results of tuesdays presidential election 
the gatherings  organized by moveonorg and allies  will affirm a continued rejection of donald trumps bigotry xenophobia islamophobia and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the america we still believe is possible 
within two hours of the calltoaction moveon members had created more than  gatherings nationwide with the number continuing to grow on wednesday afternoon 
soros agitprop empire 
last year during the ongoing european migrant crisis startling claims were levied by hungarian pm victor orban left photo concerning the role played by soros 
pm orban contended that the founder and chair of open society foundations open society institute was entrenched in a  circle of activists that inadvertently become part of this international humansmuggling network 
the stunning declaration by orban recalled the misguided machinations of the occupy movement  aka ows in  as well as the soros funded protests in ferguson missouri in  along with other black lives matter protests this past year  all of which were uniquely designed to push naive participants along with paid provocateurs into violent action and social unrest 
back in january moveon publicly endorsed the bernie sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for blm associated groups seen backing sanders its worth mentioning that moveon also supported the obama campaign in  and according to the website sanders was the only other candidate to reach the threshold for an endorsement 
as we said back in march professional political agitator flash mobs had been mobilized at future trump campaign events making it very difficult to run a normal campaign  as activists attempted to take away trumps strength in numbers at his rallies this was confirmed at events in both ohio and at a trump primary campaign event the university of illinois chicago earlier this year where hundreds of blm activists and sanders supporters triggered voilent clashes inside the venue and even stormed the stage  shortly after trump started speaking then again at reno he was birddogged just prior to his election forcing secret service to escort trump away 
in a politico article in early  entitled  major donors consider funding black lives matter  we gained deeper insight into the political funding for blm and the soros linked democratic alliance 
major donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression said steve phillips a democracy alliance member and significant contributor to democratic candidates and causes he donated to a st louis nonprofit group called the organization for black struggle that helped organize  black lives matterrelated protests in ferguson missouri over the police killing of a black teenager named michael brown and phillips and his wife democracy alliance board member susan sandler are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement 
it worth noting how soros a long time contributor to hillary clinton donated  million in pac money in  and january of  soros reportedly gave  million to boost clintons campaign  soros also recently funded  million to latino groups looking to stop trumps rise towards a potential gop nomination and beyond 
look for these political engineers to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other across the country  as all of these hostile uprisings are designer engineered by party linked alliances 
social engineering political memes and staged political flash mobs have been sparked by media ngos and social media image source abc news  
during the last month it was revealed how investigative nonprofit project veritas found evidence that the dnc paid participants to incite violence at trump rallies during the course of the  election 
if those reports are accurate  reports which have gone unchallenged so far  this would be in violation of both election bylaws and also us criminal law 
paid protest social justice warriors incite antitrump violence across the us image source youtube  
usa color revolutions 
both the purpose of these types of agitation activities seems to be to first cause a public disruption and also to foment are a form of modern class warfare these political protests are designed in such a way as to disguise its true intentions ultimately a radical globalist and cultural marxist progressive agenda is at play  eroding the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial color upheavals and where possible  weakening a countrys national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the un or imf while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the publics political perspective 
this is how the us and its cia conduct their destablization color revolution campaigns overseas  and now astute observers will be able to see these exact same methods being deployed here inside the us 
overseas washington tends to use the same cast of ngo fronts to buildup prous political opposition groups as well as plan and generate civil unrest they include the albert einstein institute aei national endowment for democracy ned international republican institute iri national democratic institute ndi freedom house and later the international center for nonviolent conflict icnc and the us agency for international development usaid the financial and contractor arm of the department of state 
inside the us deep state actors in washington generally work through democratic party affiliated organizations like moveonorg  as well as through labor union organizations like aflcio  and unite here  these along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this weeks protests 
it still remains to be seen if trumps stated dynamic political vision for america can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world in addition to helping economic woes at home or will it simply push the country further into authoritarianism this remains to be seen 
certainly judging by president obama and hillary clintons total silence over their own partys role in fomenting this weeks unrest  one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots the political motivation is undeniable  to help delegitimize a new trump presidency 
but one thing is for sure  theres no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unsettle the th president and the public should question why 
legal action against soros groups 
in a recent report featured at rt news we learn that george soros and blm activists will be sued for the deaths of slain police officers in dallas and baton rouge the father of the dallas police officer who was killed by a lone gunman during a black lives matter protest is suing the organizations activists and george soros for  million  in a separate suit a baton rouge police officer is suing for injuries sustained during a blm protest 
the father of patrick zamarripa filed a lawsuit against black lives matter and other groups for allegedly inciting a war on police that led to the death of his son 
the lawsuit filed in us district court in dallas on monday seeks  million in damages 
while defendant black lives matter claims to combat antiblack racism the lawsuit said according to the fort worth star telegram the movement has in fact incited and committed further violence severe bodily injury and death against police officers of all races and ethnicities jews and caucasians defendant black lives matter is in fact a violent and revolutionary criminal gang 
the misguided machinations behind the antitrump protests have dominated any peaceful transition into power for the presidentelect will these protest groups be a reboot of the ows movement occupying the masses with their own hateful rhetoric as we move into  and beyond

the election campaign might be over but the mainstream medias campaign against president elect donald trump is in full swing 
between all of the fake polling intentionally proclinton partisan coverage and mainstream media collusion with the democratic national party and the clinton campaign exposed through wikileaks podesta email dump  nearly the entire us mainstream media is now in full damagelimitation mode desperately trying to preserve any crumb of credibility and perceived authority they might have left 
its now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence while promoting unfounded fears  and all the while pushing fictional hate crime hoaxes 
cbs news flagship investigative program  minutes conducted a recorded interview with trump on friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to stop it in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public or at schools in light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked america since the election results were announced last week it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by trump but instead mainstream cbs buried it for  days until  minutes was scheduled to air later on sunday evening nationwide if cbs had any credibility remaining this certainly will have finished it off 
when told about alleged reports of a trump supporter who were said to have been harassing latinos and muslims following his presidential win trump told interviewer leslie stahl  i am so saddened to hear that he then added and i say stop it if it helps i will say this  and i will say right to the cameras stop it 
one big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did stahl give any specifics on these alleged abuses by trump supporters against muslims and latinos and even though its obvious that trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses  stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf  without offering any evidence to support her claim this was driveby media at its worst in fact not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media and some may end up actually being mediagenerated rumors or even hoaxes 
now its perfectly understandable that trumps victory over the establishments heavily inflated candidate hillary clinton has left many democrats especially millennial collegeaged students upset angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos they are not upset that trump won as much as they are upset that they lost the real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of americas politically correctobsessed young adults the real danger is that democratic party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging and fabricating hate crime incidents in order to propagate the idea that the president elect and his supporters are somehow causing many minorities fearful about the future in reality much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets 
in fact one muslim female from louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged hate crime incident  one designed to discredit trump and to help stoke more nationwide protests 
buzzfeed reported via religion of peace  
a woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the university of louisiana at lafayette including one wearing a donald trump hat made up the story police said in a statement 
the woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab a scarf sometimes worn by muslim women the advertiser reported 
lafayette police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation the paper reported 
during the course of the investigation the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males the statement reportedly read 
note this story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of selfdescribed journalists who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of americas corrupt liberal mainstream media 
thats right  this was just another hoax 
violent democraticaffiliated street gangs 
what leslie stahl and the rest of the gatekeepers at cbs and  minutes have obscured is the fact since tuesdays election nearly all of the socalled violent hate crimes have been carried out against trump supporters  by street gangs who are most clearly democrat party supporters 
here are just a few examples michellemalkin even high school kids are not spared student trump supporter attacked at woodside high school httpstcoetvvdjo

watch this clip taken from the radical leftist portland protests this weekend where democratic party supports attack a single woman in her car because they believed that she was a trump supporter these violent incidents reveal the flavor of anarchy which the democratic party and the sitting president of the united states barack obama  are condoning through their deaf silence over the multiple reports of street violence unleashed with the help of the democratic partys online community organizer network moveonorg  a digital platform partly funded by leading clinton donor and billionaire george soros  watch this stunning clip 
 here is a video of clip of a white male in chicago  yr old david wilcox who was driving and scraped another vehicle when the two parties stopped at the intersection to exchange insurance information wilcox was greeted by a gang of africanamericans presumably democratic party supporters who began pointing and shouting you voted for donald trump before beating and robbing the man in the middle of the street wilcox was then dragged hundreds of yards as he tried to keep the gang from stealing his car in broad daylight he was treated for multiple wounds at a local hospital 
from reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did wilcox display any support for donald trump it appears as if they attacked him because he was white so could one call this a case of black on white racism regardless its political intimidation done on the street  which could also be defined as pure political fascism in this instance the violence was partisan and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial democrat foot soldiers  enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of america watch this disturbing video  agitator and chief where is obama 
these incidents have been mostly blacked out by a national us media who are obviously still working to discredit the trump presidency 
amidst all this violence however where is the current president obama or the democratic partys losing candidate hillary clinton  to help calm street thugs and violent progressives its almost as if obama and clinton are enjoying the unrest most certainly though obama clinton and the democratic party are hoping to use this weeks mediagenerated liberal angst as future political leverage 
what used to be regarded as a reputable investigative news program  minutes has gradually become a joke it seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest opting instead for running bland people magazine and time magazinestyle safe segments judging by its plummeting ratings and its predictable cast of job for life governmentapproved media gatekeepercumcommentators like anderson cooper and lesley stahl there is little hope for this institution you might even say its irredeemable  
one of the corporate mainstreams worst offenders during the election was cnn host brian stelter photo left whose own show is ironically titled reliable sources stelter is meant to be cnns media watchdog person laughably given the lofty title as senior media analyst after leading cnns own exposed efforts to obscure and derail trumps presidential run while working to cover for a hugely unpopular even among democrats hillary clinton candidacy stelter has now taken it upon himself to revamp his networks horrible reputation as an establishment gatekeeper and manipulator of us elections but its too late the damage has already been done and cnn will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain they are a dirty media outlet and now everyone knows it 
now cbs news has been exposed in public view but their crime is even worse than cnns which was just dirty politics in comparison cbs news took it upon itself to compromise public safety and put lives at risk  all for its own selfish institutional political position twenty years ago this might have been considered shameful but in todays toxic liberal media establishment ruled by an unhealthy feeling of superiority over the unwashed masses  they are all way past shameless at this stage 
none of them can be trusted anymore  only tolerated in the hope that they might actually report some useful news in the coming years

lets get this straight calling hillary clinton a bigot has reporters asking every republican in sight if donald trump has gone too far but the clinton campaign releases a video saying mr trump is the candidate of the ku klux klan and its all okeydokey 
then again mr trump has already been likened to hitler mussolini and stalin small wonder theres a collective hohum when democratic vice presidential nominee tim kaine says mr trump is peddling kkk values 
this is what democrats do it didnt start with mr trump either for years democrats have portrayed the gop as one giant hate group 
each presidential election the drill goes like this 
after republicans nominate someone he immediately finds himself having to prove hes not a hater  of africanamericans of women of gays etc 
this year democrats added a twist mr trump they claim represents a break with all those decent and lovable republicans such as mitt romney  john mccain and george w bush  of course this isnt what they were saying back when these men were running for president 
 in  for example an naacp ad recreated the gruesome murder of james byrd to imply that thengov bush was sympathetic to lynching black men over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck mr byrds daughter says so when gov george w bush refused to support hatecrimes legislation it was like my father was killed all over again 
 when john mccain ran in  barack obama warned that republicans would scare people by saying you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills the mccain campaign fired back accusing mr obama of playing the race card from the bottom of the deck funny thing all those reporters always hearing dog whistles from republicans somehow didnt hear this one 
 in  when mitt romney went to the naacp and told them facetoface about his opposition to obamacare the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote vice president joe biden put it more explicitly telling a largely africanamerican audience that if mr romney were to win hed put yall back in chains 
the only difference today is that republicans now have a nominee giving as good as he gets",2016-11-16

st century wire says 
although the election was called on nov th the democratic partys ongoing campaign to delegitimize the new incoming president is still ongoing 
for those of us with long enough memories the democratic party their media operatives and the clinton campaign were claiming that trump and the gop would be engaged in this very same behavior after hillary clinton won the presidency as expected 
notice how the shoe is now on the other foot 
its interesting reading past stories by news sources linked to the clinton campaign and john podesta as politico has who ran a feature on aug th entitled why the gop will never accept president hillary clinton which lays out the case of hillarys lock on the white house and how the evil republicans will not accept her eventual election victory 
will donald trump respect the peaceful transition of power howled cnns wolf blitzer in the runup to the election the question now is will the democrats respect the result and simply move on as they say 
of course we now know that journalists like wolf at cnn were getting their talking points directly the clinton campaign

a growing number of academics and activists are calling for us authorities to fully audit or recount the  presidential election vote in key battleground states in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers 
the loose coalition which is urging hillary clintons campaign to join its fight is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week according to two people involved 
the document which is currently  pages long focuses on concerns about the results in the states of michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin 
im interested in verifying the vote said dr barbara simons an adviser to the us election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting we need to have postelection ballot audits simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement 
a second group of analysts led by the national voting rights institute founder john bonifaz and professor alex halderman the director of the university of michigans center for computer security and society is also taking part in the push for a review and has been in contact with simons 
in a blogpost early on wednesday halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching 
unfortunately nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now in the next several days to petition for recounts he said 
the developments follow clintons surprise defeat to donald trump in the  november vote and come after us intelligence authorities released public assessments that russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from democratic officials before the election

21,hillary clinton supporters now calling for a recount of votes in battleground states,"while richard spencers halfjoke of hailing donald trump with r oman salute rose a lot of dust some remarks in his npi speech point into rather sinister direction a posthuman one 
transcript with references and additional av material 
undoubtedly there was a sigh of relief throughout the world when hillary clinton lost presidential elections to donald trump if for nothing else then for the sake of quiet joy of watching adolescent commissars melt in tears because racism homophobia xenophobia and whateverphobia it was a joy and a relief because it showed monolithic control system of moral nominalism  dubbed political correctness to be a paper tiger 
however party is over and dialectics is back with the vengeance as sjw s are hopefully moving out from the spotlight of posthistorical stage the new contender asserts his right to fashion the reality of our day and age into his own image if we are to judge the day by the first gleam of dawn this image will be just as ugly  and just as unreal  as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct  shitlib  
in the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the alternative right movement richard spencer in the future we are to deal with the leadership of children of the sun 
this is an interesting and to my mind quite worrisome statement of intent  a manifestation of will as spencer would doubtless rectify me  pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal  and quite unidirectional  circular movement of the pagan deity revered by all selfrespecting übermenschen  from nietzsche to postmodern occultists 
however theres a deeper astrotheological metaphor at work here the pure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy without envy nietzsche in its virtual postmodern installment is not to be strictly represented by swastika  as spencer apparently assumes but by other only seemingly ancient symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and pc gaming and turned into ideological brand by russian philosopher alexander dugin or his minions an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement 
the symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement not of sun but of presumably primordial origin of everything chaos 
in the lines to follow well provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation the channeling of chaos principle  and adjacent chaos logic  through loosely knit alt right movement taking as a starting point some statements from spencers speech held at npi conference in washington dc on november  st  

triumph of the will or hipster babylon working 

in introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right embodied in the election of donald trump spencer makes one interesting remark 
but even though we always took trump seriously there was still a moment of unreality  or perhaps too painfully intense reality  when the state of pennsylvania was called for donald trump the moment when we knew kek had smiled upon us that meme magic was real and though these terms are used halfjokingly they represent something truly importantthe victory of will  we willed donald trump into office made this dream into reality  
it is all delivered in a manner of an injoke not to be taken too seriously moreover to the uninitiated into mysteries of this internet movement it is probably unclear who is kek and what exactly is meme magic 
well start our explanation with lesser weirdness 
meme is an expression denoting inexistent existent coined apparently by richard dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology memes are thoughts expressed in image andor phrase which by circulation in public acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to infect the consciousness with their messages like viruses meme is inexistent because theres no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based selfsubsistence and ability to procreate like viruses images andor phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial yet they quite paradoxically exist because analogy apparently works  however no one seems to pose the question why it works 
well it works because it is magical 

chaos magick 

here we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern  in fact posthumanist  vein resting on assumption that what has not evolved in nature can  and should  be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution if artificial construct is in line with principle of evolution it is real or to be more precise it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle it is imagined into existence  
therefore meme magick works only insofar it relies upon artificial preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with memes as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs 
the goal of practitioner of such magic  a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic  is to change the world according to his will this is more or less what is known from the seventies of the last century as chaos magick  a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in subhuman and subnatural domain of the world in the past mostly confined to people born with dubious talent to practice it the peculiarity of chaos magick is on the one hand that it is entirely syncretic ie that it uses everything that its practitioner can imbibe with intended subjective meaning and that it relies on virtual ie artificial world of mass culture now embodied above all in internet 
the idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible  
there are many interesting implications to this 
the first is that everything is interrelated ie that everything is connected with everything else so any which way you take youll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough the second is that theres no hierarchy of higher and lower  theres only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements dissolving in turn into nothingness if concentrated upon as theres nothing higher theres nothing to be revered and everything can  and indeed should  be an object of ironical laughter and most importantly this is the world of dreams ruled by what is usually called dream logic but in actual fact chaos logic or unlogic  
in this sense richard spencer quite accurately proclaimed trumps victory an accomplishment of meme or chaos magick 
trump is willed into office by internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality  virtual reality one may add yet reality nonetheless the fact that trump was elected for a plethora of motives  from the appeal of his politics to public takedown of hillary clinton by wikileaks  is immaterial because in the world of chaos every subjective reality tunnel or interpretation of the world is as real as any other 
in this sense we can observe new god emperor of usa as a magical creation of internet by the internet and for the internet  today still the internet of interconnected computer nodes but soon probably the internet of things if one is to push spencers remark to its logical extreme we can assert that illustrious donald is the worlds first president of posthuman race an embodiment of ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra antiprogressive group 
so that was lesser weirdness let us proceed now to high weirdness 


we owe the reader an answer to a question who the hell is kek 
well the reason why spencer mentions him is again a magickal halfjoke kek is interpreted to be an ancient egyptian deity by a number of internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar  pepe the frog while i habitually suspend judgment on all things egyptian because ancient egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts i consider this interpretation upon closer inspection to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic 
namely pepe the cartoon character conceived in  by cartoonist matt furie emerged as a meme from the depths of internet forums more precisely chan subforum pol devoted to political discussions with no holds barred which was in view of some observers a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados a place of absolute freedom therefore absolute chaos 
the expression kek was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the injoke among the players of world of warcraft  replacing the standard internet abbreviation lol laughing out loud someone eventually noticed that kek is in fact the name of frogheaded egyptian deity signifying chaos and darkness and pepe was rebranded as kek the deity  ironic one no doubt half joking one as surprisingly many alt righters like to put it but deity nonetheless 
it is important to point out that in view of the most esoteric kekists that is half grinning faithful of kekpepe the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities  causally unrelated meaningful relations among events so it came to pass that kek sounds very similar to cuckoriginally cuckservative a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not red pilled another meme taken from pop culture shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists by alt right or should we assume kek himself furthermore hillary clinton addressed pepe as nothing less than public enemy identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character then it happened that after this act hillary fainted in front of the cameras and that was immediately interpreted as an action of kek 
a good rundown of kekpepetrump identification 
however it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on pol subforum 
one last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture dubs 
every post on chan and similar venues comes with an digit numerical stamp this number represents that posts entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard 
with the amount of traffic these sites get the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll when a poster gets repeated digits its called dubs trips quads and so on 
since a poster cant know their post number until after theyve submitted the post its common for people to bet the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits  when that endeavor proves a successful a get has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated 
out of this practice a strange phenomenon began to take place on pol discussion threads associated with trump displayed noticeably frequent gets it wasnt long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture pepe the frog now pols unofficial mascot donald trump pols overwhelming candidate of choice repeating digit post numbers gets kek used as an expression of delight particular in response to trumps trolling of the establishment as well as in reaction to unlikely gets in general 
and a god was born  source  

synchronicities related to emergence of kek the god and his merging with trump in the bowels of internet forums early on in the presidential campaign are so numerous and frankly mind boggling that we cannot list them here for the sake of brevity for our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados including core leadership kek is the god and trump is his prophet all declared with smug grin and ironical stance yet with all the necessary power of conviction 
namely chaos magick relies on laughter or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially unprincipled fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its practitioner to impose his own will and change the world  as spencer would put it make his dreams a reality 
i would go further and add make all reality a dream  because chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual ie posthuman  world the idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism  in its essence however it is a complete opposite a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles  above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of being  into nothingness of primordial chaos 

posthuman traditionalism 

i already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of alexander dugin who is probably the most consequent subverter of tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age but now we can see how his affiliates in usa and europe are doing the same thing  with less philosophical subtlety but fueled by much greater raw power namely alt right if we are to judge by what its leadership advocates is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition  something richard spencer likes to call political theology  founded on new age filtered aryan myths  racial interpretation of nietzsche and generally crossbred with do your own thing mentality all done in the virtual ether of information technology after all if we are to agree with spencer  half jokingly of course  that god emperor was inaugurated by the act of kek the god then the victory of alt right traditionalists is in fact the victory of technological magic the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand ray kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics  
in the end therefore we are talking about another victory of posthumanism branded spontaneously or otherwise as traditionalism the obsession of alt right adherents with identity in general and white identity in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of tradition they supposedly defend they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted  observing the plethora of various rather eccentric individuals in its vanguard from macho gay postmodern spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic  and to a large extent made up  pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator save maybe for quite unchallenged neodarwinist stance especially to be found among game bloggers as chateau heartiste  if someone thinks that he can reattach himself to premodern spiritual history of humankind  actually the only one there is  while at the same time musing about alpha and beta males sexual market signaling and countersignaling professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental gmo of memes genes and biological analogies he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends 
the allure of alt right lies in its dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the west induced by process of globalization yet this is an eristic or to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine discordian dialectic the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of chaos it is all done with the crooked half grin a pinch of salt to every smug remark  with irony of the man who knows hes a liar and a cheat but smug humor goes just a short way in the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend far more effectively than dead serious pc brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for 
well end with the word of warning to christian adherents of alt right the words have a definite meanings and power theres only one chaos and theres only one bringer of light from chaos  as some kek worshipers already defined the poor frogs main job  and its not the one to be defined as god from god light from light but god from gutter light from darkness a real darkness shining in virtual brightness hope you guess his name 
so without a pinch of irony i declare be careful who your hail

if there was any doubt as to the intellectual bankruptcy and democratic decline of the eus super bureaucratic class those doubts can finally be put to rest this week it seems that europes technocrats have truly surrendered to their own program of euro red scare brainwashing 
the new eu resolution compares russian media organizations to terrorist groups like isis see full report below the report also claims that russian  social media and internet trolls  are somehow  challenging democratic values  the new antirussia legislation will now require many millions in funding to implement all of the antirussia programs that bureaucrats believe are needed to counter this grave threat to democracy a touch oxymoronic isnt it 
eu parliamentarians appear to have lost the plot claiming that europe is currently at war with russia is one thing but the hysterical notion that russian propaganda is somehow damaging the minds of europeans is a whole new level of crazy 
no wonder millions of britons voted to leave the eu this past summer 
the cold reality is that most of the dangerous views and information aired on rt are by presenters contributors and pundits  westerners  not russians the reason rts audience ratings are growing is because the version of news and analysis being presented is resonating with international audiences who see rts reports as more accurate and truthful than media monoliths like the bbc cnn and other establishment outlets by spending most of their time effort and budgets crafting propaganda pieces to cover for the plethora of lies and clandestine operations globally the western media are killing off their own relationship with domestic audiences the age of talking down to the public and assuming them as fools is over rt understood this in  when their news network took shape  years later western media moguls are playing catchup albeit in vainsunset for goebbels hamstrung with layers of management and editorial committees infested with intelligence agency operatives and journalists on the payroll of a deep state star chamber that is so tangled in its own web of subterfuge  obsessed with controlling real information rather than disseminating it  that their media environment has become too dysfunctional for its own good they are simply unable to do authentic journalism or speak truth to power  incredibly instead of working to help western media to phase out its own propaganda regime ideologues in brussels want to attack rt 
the faceless force behind this latest xenophobic eu resolution are those in washington paris and london who are still hellbent on keeping antirussian economic sanctions in place  much to the disservice of many european businesses and their workers who are losing out on trade with russia when donald trump is sworn in this january the usukeu antirussian axis could disintegrate within a year  so this latest move by brussels could be a lastditch effort to do some damage as europes neomccarthyites plot their escape out the back door from their disastrous coup detat in the ukraine  to natos hubris in the baltic and beyond and the eus migrant crisis debacle and the tens of millions of euros being laundered by eu member states through a pseudo ngo called the  white helmets in syria  these last  years will certainly go down as one of the worst chapters in modern diplomatic history  an abject failure of incompetent foreign policy underpinned by a backward and confused ideology 
we tried to find a coherent western reporting on this subject but it seems even the western mainstream are too embarrassed to cover this bizarre brussels adventure see the following video and written report by rt international 
 rt meps in strasbourg have voted on a nonlegislative resolution which calls for the eu to respond to information warfare by russia rt and sputnik news agency are alleged to be among the most dangerous tools of hostile propaganda 
the eu parliaments resolution demonstrates  political degradation  in regard to the  idea of democracy  in the west russian president vladimir putin said on wednesday commenting on the vote 
putin pointed out that while  everyone tries to lecture  russia on democracy european lawmakers themselves resort to a policy of restrictions  which is not the best way  to deal with any issues 
 the best approach is an open discussion in which bright and solid arguments to support ones point of view should be presented  putin said 
adding that he hopes the western move to  counter russian propaganda  wont lead to serious restrictions the president congratulated rt and sputnik journalists on their work 
in the wednesday vote  meps supported the resolution based on the report  eu strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties  with  voting against it and  abstaining 
written by a polish member of the european conservatives and reformists ecr group anna fotyga the report alleged that moscow aims to  distort the truth provoke doubt divide the eu and its north american partners paralyze the decisionmaking process discredit the eu institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among eu citizens  
the report suggests that moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in eu member states causing disintegration within the bloc 
at the same time russia is accused of  information warfare  with such entities as rt tv channel sputnik news agency rossotrudnichestvo federal agency and the russkiy mir russian world fund alleged to be among its most threatening propaganda tools  
the document places russian media organizations alongside terrorist groups such as islamic state is formerly isisisil 
the report also mentions some  social media and internet trolls  from russia who are thought to  challenge democratic values  
it called for the establishment of measures to tackle the perceived russian propaganda threat by means of  investing in awareness raising education online and local media  it also suggests stronger cooperation between the eu and nato  on strategic communication  
sputnik has already appealed to the un the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce and a number of international journalists organizations and ngos including reporters without borders to take measures to stop what it considers to be interference into freedom of speech in the eu 
 the resolution hits straight at a number of respected media including sputnik agency and has an aim to stop their activity in the eu moreover the resolution bluntly contradicts the eus own human rights and freedom of press norms reads the letter signed by sputnik editorinchief margarita simonyan 
during the parliamentary debate that preceded the vote meps campaigning for the resolution said the eu was  at war with russia on a collision course with each other traveling faster than a jet fighter  and that with an alleged  aim to split europe the kremlin forces its information into our countries",2016-11-25
23,eu red scare brussels passes new resolution to counter russian media propaganda," share the amish in america have committed their vote to donald trump guaranteeing him the presidency ap photo  dennis system 
columbus oh ap  history was made today in columbus ohio when more than  million amish poured into the city to see the american amish brotherhood aab an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the amish community endorse donald trump for president that number represents a significant portion of the total amish population which the united states census bureau says numbers more than  million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to trump for president with the full force of the amish community behind him donald trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in november 
the organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about  amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges such as urban sprawl that face the community this year however the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant republican nominee 
the amish who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the anabaptists have typically stayed out of politics in the past as a general rule they dont vote serve in the military or engage in any other displays of patriotism this year however the aab has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process 
over the past eight years the democratic party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues said aab chairman menno simons we have seen more and more christians being persecuted for their faith we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage now they want to put a woman in the nations highest leadership role in direct violation of  timothy  we need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles donald trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the lords way 
according to statistician nate silver of the website fivethirtyeightcom there are no possible scenarios in which hillary clinton can win with donald trump carrying the amish vote 
the amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like pennsylvania virginia ohio indiana and iowa silver noted they also have strong numbers in reliably democratic states like michigan illinois and new york meaning that hillary will lose those states as well there is also a sizeable community in florida which while not as large as it is in the midwest is still large enough to turn florida for trump over the next two weeks you can expect hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models 
the clinton campaign issued a written statement to the aab asking them to reconsider their decision 
i dont believe that donald trump is the person who best represents your interests clinton wrote to the aab as a career real estate developer he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life as former first lady of arkansas i understand the concerns of rural americans more than any candidate in this election i implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent 
most pundits believe that mrs clintons plea is too little too late 
during a press conference in manhattan trump thanked the aab for their support and promised to put the amish to work maintaining government buildings which he said would save taxpayers millions because the amish do great work for a very low price 
though clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end many of her campaign workers have already resigned according to the associated press it is expected that the clinton campaign will lose  of its staff over the next two weeks there is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the clinton camp and many simply want to cut their losses 
it looked like she was going to win this election easily said paul horner a campaign worker in ohio but this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant cleary mrs clinton took far too much for granted in this race and we are all now paying the price its really sad to see the campaign end this way

24,the amish in america commit their vote to donald trump mathematically guaranteeing him a presidential victory  abc news," share president obama has signed an executive order declaring an investigation into the election results and plans for a revote on december th ap photo  dennis system 
washington dc ap  following the results of tuesday nights election president obama has signed executive order   which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on december  th  obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day  too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted  equipment failures as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically 
people all over the country have been flooding my office with calls telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers obama told reporters many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a hillary clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as president this was especially bad in areas of florida and north carolina where there are high numbers of latino and african american voters we must investigate these claims the margin of victory is too close to call and the outcome of this election is too important there is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for trump 
under the presidents order the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted and all poll workers who took part in tuesdays election will be subjected to strict background checks this process is expected to take  days in precincts where the department of justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred new elections will be held on dec  th with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college 
not surprisingly donald trump is not happy with the presidents decision 
crooked hillary lost this election fair and square they tried to rig this election against me but the american people didnt allow that to happen president obama doesnt care about what the american people want i said the system was rigged all along and this proves i was right 
the president also said that the doj will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college 
we have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states we still need to investigate these claims but if they are true we will take all the appropriate actions necessary 
paul horner a professor of political science at ucla believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election 
most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the united states but there is nothing in the constitution that says that hillary clinton won the popular vote by more than  votes  but because of the electoral college she still lost that decision is reserved solely for the  electors who meet in their respective states on december  th  what the people are actually voting for are their states electors not for the president though the system is odd and unfair it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching that does not mean however that it will continue to work just fine in the future the way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways this recent election being one of them 
political analyst matt daemon told abc news that he agrees with the presidents executive order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether 
the electoral college is a fking joke we should be using the popular vote instead it may have made sense in  but so did the three fifths compromise  everyone should have an equal vote and thats just not the case with the electoral college you know what the electoral college gave us it gave us george w bush it gave us a war in iraq and the worst recession since the great depression its time to bring our system into the  st century i hope obama fixes this because president trump is going to be a nightmare 
obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward 
were going to investigate the fbi into their role in all of this obama said why did fbi director james comey on sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against clinton after reviewing all of her emails declaring hillary clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election why wasnt this news released earlier how many votes were lost because of this obama said if all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in december a recount will be ordered

concern grows over soroslinked voting machines   
sixteen states may be using balloting equipment from a company tied to the leftist billionaire  
by edmund kozak  updated  oct  at  pm  
concern is growing over revelations that voting machines in a significant number of states could be linked to a company tied directly to billionaire leftist george soros and his personal quest to create a nationless borderless global state 

the ukbased smartmatic company posted a flowchart on its website that it had provided voting machines for  states including important battleground states like florida and arizona smartmatic chairman mark mallochbrown is a former un official and sits on the board of soros open society foundations since the story first broke the flowchart has disappeared from smartmatics website raising further questions about the real status of the sorostied voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in us elections 

if mallochbrowns soros ties werent troubling enough he also has ties to the clintons through his work at two consulting firms 

according to a spokesperson for the national association of secretaries of state smartmatic is not on a list of federally certified providers for election systems and officials in several states have contested that their equipment came from smartmatic why then had smartmatic bragged about providing over  voting machines for us elections

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september  

public government data available as usaspendinggov

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan 

wikileaks leaks have proven hillarys corrupt paytoplay scheme gotnews has shined a light on how hillary gets favors from hispanic and democratic government bureaucrats before  

did hillary clinton pay her email server company platte river networks prn with almost  million in favorable government loans  given out by a political friendly  in order to alter her illegal emails and get her name off them 

it sure looks like it

why bill clintons  trips on the lolita express child rape jet matter may    
daniel greenfield   
we dont know what bill clinton did or didnt do in company with jeffrey epstein but we certainly know what epstein did and almost as outrageously what he got away with doing  

some of the most shocking allegations against epstein surfaced only after the conclusion of an fbi probe in civil suits brought by his victims for example the claim that three yearold french girls were delivered to him as a birthday present but the feds did identify roughly  young women most of them underage at the time who described being lured to epsteins palm beach home on the pretense of giving a massage for money then pressured into various sex acts as well as the balkan sex slave epstein allegedly boasted of purchasing from her family when she was just  more recently a big cash payment from mail on sunday coaxed one of epsteins main accusers out of anonymity to describe what she claims were her years as a teenage sex toy this victim virginia roberts produced a photo of herself with prince andrew in  and reported that epstein paid her  to meet the prince then  years old she claims that she was abused by epstein and loaned to his friends from the age of  

sex crimes of the kind roberts alleges took place typically carry a term of  to  years in federal prison yet when all was said and done epstein served his scant yearplusonemonth in a private wing of the palm beach jail and was granted a hourperday free pass to leave the premises for work 

in short epstein was never actually in jail during his house arrest he flew around the country on his jets from his new york city place to his private island at least one of epsteins victims claimed to have met bill clinton and it turns out that bill clinton was a much more regular passenger on the lolita express 

former president bill clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offenders infamous jet than previously reported with flight logs showing the former president taking at least  trips aboard the lolita express  even apparently ditching his secret service detail for at least five of the flights according to records obtained by foxnewscom 

clintons presence aboard jeffrey epsteins boeing  on  occasions has been reported but flight logs show the number is more than double that and trips between  and  included extended junkets around the world with epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names including tatiana the trickedout jet earned its nabakovinspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls 

it doesnt help that the democratic establishment seems to have played a role in getting epstein a pass on child rape that bill clinton already had rape accusations in his past or that the clintons had become notorious for their willingness to do favors for criminals in exchange for money 

either way weve come a long way from gary hart being bounced for monkey business to bill clinton flying around on a child rapists plane without anyone in the media seeming to care much about it 

social conservatives often get a bad rap but there really is no limit to how low standards can fall when any trace of a moral code vanishes out the window what did bill clinton actually do who knows more importantly these days who cares 

about daniel greenfield 

daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 

for sure defence counsel have made much of taylors involvement with the missing and murdered women all but pointing the finger at her as homicidal maniac the real killer whats not in dispute is that taylor is one scary character  streethardened menacing a procurer of prostitutes lured to the pickton farm contemptuous of both sextrade workers especially street walkers and drug addicts 

shes pure evil says one outreach worker who asked that her name not be used in any story about taylor 

 

court has heard that taylors dna was found on  items retrieved from the pickton property  including handcuffs condoms clothing syringes  and also on items that belonged to some victims  brenda wolfes lipstick mona wilsons rosary 

one witness pickton pal pat casanova told the court he once received fellatio from a woman he knew as angel whod been brought to the farm by taylor he said he gave the money to taylor who shared some of it with angel 

another witness gina houston put taylor on the same bed with victim sereena abotsway in picktons trailer 

in his lengthy police interview pickton repeatedly tells police he wants to speak with taylor 

on the stand houston recounted a conversation shed had with pickton about taylor shortly before his arrest 

willie told me that he believed she taylor would do the right thing when she came back that she would take responsibility for what she said she would take responsibility for

jeff wells points to other odd things 

a week or so ago a man called steve remian committed suicidebycop but the name steve remian surfaced at the robert willie pickton murder trial in new westminster bc last march when jurors were told that remians name  with a burnaby bc address  was on the label of a suitcase packed into a box found in picktons workshop 

in april jurors heard further evidence that dna testing on two hairs found on a hudsons bay blanket removed from picktons motorhome linked one to pickton and the other to a steve remian 

a source involved in the oakville shooting investigation told the star that the man shot by police had been charged with sexual assault earlier in life while living in oakville but had been acquitted although a coaccused was convicted 

source 

it does seem like a regular hive of activity robert picktons pig farm was a constant buzz of activity with people and vehicles coming and going all the time a woman who lived in picktons trailer for a time testified on wednesday 

tanya carr  told the jury in picktons murder trial that people were coming and going all day long at the port coquitlam bc farm and it wasnt unusual for people to show up late at night looking for pickton or his brother dave 

source 

also there are those hells angels and the piggy palace 

it was a rough crowd at piggys palace said brian a musician who played there a few years ago with the hardrock band south city slam 

the nightclub he said was inside an old building on a property dave pickton and his brother robert own at  burns rd near their pig farm on dominion road in port coquitlam 

even the women were tough looking  a lot of leather and denim it wasnt a cocktailgown kind of place  he recalled 

brian who didnt want his last name used recalled that there was a coatcheck girl and a sign saying check your knives and other weapons at the door  

the crowd at piggys palace often included men wearing hells angels biker club colours 

they were there a lot said brian the people who came all seemed to know one another

july   developments in pki occurred in the early s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids 

the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting 

assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications 

vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others 

the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be 

by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient 

pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards program

concern grows over soroslinked voting machines   
sixteen states may be using balloting equipment from a company tied to the leftist billionaire  
by edmund kozak  updated  oct  at  pm  
concern is growing over revelations that voting machines in a significant number of states could be linked to a company tied directly to billionaire leftist george soros and his personal quest to create a nationless borderless global state 

the ukbased smartmatic company posted a flowchart on its website that it had provided voting machines for  states including important battleground states like florida and arizona smartmatic chairman mark mallochbrown is a former un official and sits on the board of soros open society foundations since the story first broke the flowchart has disappeared from smartmatics website raising further questions about the real status of the sorostied voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in us elections 

if mallochbrowns soros ties werent troubling enough he also has ties to the clintons through his work at two consulting firms 

according to a spokesperson for the national association of secretaries of state smartmatic is not on a list of federally certified providers for election systems and officials in several states have contested that their equipment came from smartmatic why then had smartmatic bragged about providing over  voting machines for us elections

breaking hillaryclintons email server company got almost  million in govt loans after wiping emails

give it up already its over k j gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story 

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september  

public government data available as usaspendinggov 

the first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after prn employee paul combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at hillarys request in july   

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan 

wikileaks leaks have proven hillarys corrupt paytoplay scheme gotnews has shined a light on how hillary gets favors from hispanic and democratic government bureaucrats before  

did hillary clinton pay her email server company platte river networks prn with almost  million in favorable government loans  given out by a political friendly  in order to alter her illegal emails and get her name off them 

it sure looks like it 

a freedom of information act foia request has been lodged for more information

police conclude search of starnet   
cbc news posted aug    am et last updated aug    am et  
police have wrapped up several days of searching the offices of starnet communications in vancouver they entered the company offices and homes of some directors on friday 

police were looking for evidence of illegal gambling distributing child pornography and money laundering since the raid starnet officials say police just dont understand their business 

the search warrant details  months of police investigation it traces a network of companies registered in american and caribbean jurisdictions 

the warrant also identifies vancouver as the centre of starnets operations even though this is a grey under canadian law 

police note that starnets revenues grew dramatically in the past two years from betting and sex shows and from lucrative licensing agreements for its gaming software the investigations and pornography from company sites were grounds for fridays raid and seizure of company materials 

rcmp constable peter thiessen says investigators left starnet offices yesterday morning he says they spent the better part of three days going through the business and as a result of that search the investigation is continuing but no charges have been laid starnets many investors were spooked by the raid share prices dropped almost percent on friday however the company insists the raid had minimal effect on its operation stocks rose slightly yesterday after a day of very heavy trading 

in written statements company ceo mark dohlen said the wall street journal calls starnet the leader in internet gaming and entertainment he says companies like his those on the cutting edge are often misunderstood yesterday starnet announced it will sell off the sex side of its business it plans to focus more resources on gaming 

the police investigation is expected to last for several more months

assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications 

vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others 

the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be 

by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient 

pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards program

the case of the vanishing visa files  
december    pm pst  
by chuck goudie   
december   chicago  potentially important evidence has disappeared in a terrorism case involving two chicago men their visa records vanished from chicagos indian consulate it comes one week after the abc  iteam raised questions about how david coleman headley and tahawwur rana obtained their foreign visas in the first place 

the case of the vanishing visa records has churned up diplomats from mumbai to michigan avenue indias foreign secretary nirupama rao told reporters overseas wednesday that she wants answers from chicagos indian consulate about the records and visa documents that have disappeared records that might show how two accused chicago terrorists obtained permission to scout targets in india 

top officials of chicagos india consulate wouldnt talk to the iteam on camera last week when asked how terror suspects david coleman headley and tahawwur rana obtained fiveyear unlimited passage visas to india 

and the consul general did not return calls wednesday regarding the paperwork they used to process headley and ranas visas which indian foreign secretary nirupama rao announced wednesday have disappeared 

wednesday evening the chicago consul general emailed a statement to the iteam that conflicted with government statements made in india the brief statement read we have not reported loss of any papers regarding issuance of visa to david coleman headley and tahawwur rana hussain relevant information concerning the issuance of visa to these persons is available with the government of india 

indias counterpart to the fbi is looking into the visa application process as part of its probe into the  mumbai massacre 

the two chicago suspects are accused of having roles in the assault rana was denied bond by a chicago district judge tuesday despite family members and friends offering  million in cash and property rana has not been directly charged with the mumbai attack that left  dead but was linked to the assault in government court filings 

headley a pakistanborn chicagoan is a convicted heroin dealer whose birth name was daood giliani he changed his name to ease travel to india according to federal prosecutors in chicago and to avoid the required previsa background check by indian authorities 

since the time headley and rani were processed indias chicago consulate office began contracting out visa requests to a private company called travisa outsourcing that on its website claims we have revolutionized the way people get their visas 

and the new visa processing was subject of a news conference last year 

the advantages of outsourcing is the travisa company which is handling the outsourcing has set up a call center said ashok kumar attri consul general 

foreign secretary rao said she is impressed with the cooperation the us has given to indian investigators headley and rana are not due back in court until january

barack obama was assigned to michelle obama in summer  this may have reflected how few blacks there were at sidley austin especially from harvard law school or the equivalent dohrn got her jd from university of chicago law school since she is a prof at northwestern despite her background we might infer she was very smart and understanding so she was the perfect person to be the mentor for michelle obama at sidley austin

give it up already its over k j gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story 

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september  

public government data available as usaspendinggov 

the first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after prn employee paul combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at hillarys request in july   

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan 

wikileaks leaks have proven hillarys corrupt paytoplay scheme gotnews has shined a light on how hillary gets favors from hispanic and democratic government bureaucrats before  

did hillary clinton pay her email server company platte river networks prn with almost  million in favorable government loans  given out by a political friendly  in order to alter her illegal emails and get her name off them 

it sure looks like it 

a freedom of information act foia request has been lodged for more information

police conclude search of starnet   
cbc news posted aug    am et last updated aug    am et  
police have wrapped up several days of searching the offices of starnet communications in vancouver they entered the company offices and homes of some directors on friday 

police were looking for evidence of illegal gambling distributing child pornography and money laundering since the raid starnet officials say police just dont understand their business 

the search warrant details  months of police investigation it traces a network of companies registered in american and caribbean jurisdictions 

the warrant also identifies vancouver as the centre of starnets operations even though this is a grey under canadian law 

police note that starnets revenues grew dramatically in the past two years from betting and sex shows and from lucrative licensing agreements for its gaming software the investigations and pornography from company sites were grounds for fridays raid and seizure of company materials 

rcmp constable peter thiessen says investigators left starnet offices yesterday morning he says they spent the better part of three days going through the business and as a result of that search the investigation is continuing but no charges have been laid starnets many investors were spooked by the raid share prices dropped almost percent on friday however the company insists the raid had minimal effect on its operation stocks rose slightly yesterday after a day of very heavy trading 

in written statements company ceo mark dohlen said the wall street journal calls starnet the leader in internet gaming and entertainment he says companies like his those on the cutting edge are often misunderstood yesterday starnet announced it will sell off the sex side of its business it plans to focus more resources on gaming 

the police investigation is expected to last for several more months

benghazi consulate attackers used militarystyle tactics say us officials  
experts still unsure whether assault that killed  americans in libya could have been prevented  
by matt apuzzo and kimberly dozier   
september    am  washington ap  the heavily armed extremists who laid siege to the us consulate in libya used militarystyle tactics that may have steered americans toward a waiting ambush us officials said friday as they pieced together details about how the compound was overrun 

us intelligence indicates that  or more people many of them masked were responsible for the sept  assault on the us diplomatic mission in benghazi gun trucks provided added firepower the attackers set up a perimeter controlling access in and out of the compound a first wave of attacks sent the americans fleeing to a fallback building where a second group of extremists beset them with precise mortar fire 

intelligence reports were still coming in but officials told the associated press that what may have initially seemed like a protest over an antiislam movie that had spun out of control now showed the hallmarks of a more sophisticated operation 

in a country coming off a civil war a level of battlefield savvy does not prove the attack on the compound was planned well in advance how much planning went into the operation and whether it could have been detected or prevented remain unanswered questions officials said 

the attacks killed ambassador chris stevens diplomat sean smith and two former navy seals who us officials said were security officers guarding diplomatic officials stevens was visiting benghazi from tripoli to preside over the opening of an american space cultural center 

the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss intelligence reports they stressed that even now authorities do not have a clear understanding of exactly what happened in benghazi fbi agents from new york and washington were in libya investigating the attack 

what happened in benghazi was a terrorist attack secretary of state hillary clinton said friday and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four americans 

officials have not singled out one responsible group but have focused their attention on ansar alshariah a libyan militant group led by a former detainee at the us militaryrun prison in guantanamo bay cuba 

since the civil war that ousted libyan dictator moammar gadhafi last year the country has been awash with rebels militias and terrorists weaponry is easy to come by both from the former regime from weapons depots looted during the war and from foreign powers that armed the rebellion the origin of the weapons used in the assault on the us compound was unclear officials said

in response to the letter sent by fbi director james convey to eight republican committee chairman in congress hillary for america chair john podesta released the following statement friday 

upon completing this investigation more than three months ago fbi director comet declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call in the months since donald trump and his republican allies have been baselessly secondguessing the fbi and in both public and private browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm hillary clintons presidential campaign

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september

the first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after prn employee paul combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at hillarys request in july   

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan

last night a leaked memo was revealed indicating fbi director james comeys stated reasons for reopening the clinton email probe upon discovering what now appear to be tens of thousands of huma abedin emails located on anthony weiners notebook comey revealed two core reasons for the action a sense of obligation to lawmakers and a concern that word of the new email discovery would leak to the media and raise questions of a coverup what he did not reveal and as has emerged overnight from a report by the new yorkers jane mayer is that comey also acted in contravention to doj practices and more importantly acted contrary to the preference of doj head loretta lynch whose infamous meeting with bill clinton on the phoenix tarmac at the end of june will likely be reassessed in light of these latest revelations 


according to the new yorker comeys decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about clinton was contrary to the views of the attorney general according to a wellinformed administration official lynch expressed her preference that comey follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise  
traditionally the justice department has advised prosecutors and law enforcement to avoid any appearance of meddling in the outcome of elections even if it means holding off on pressing cases  one former senior official recalled that janet reno the attorney general under bill clinton completely shut down the prosecution of a politically sensitive criminal target prior to an election  she was adamantanything that could influence the election had to go dark the former official said please go to zero hedge to read the entire article",2016-10-29

do not forgive the msm 

the msm turned on hillary the fbi turned on hillary want to know why because in florida where they flipped a huge number of votes trump still had  percent of the vote nationwide they did not have the vote scam machines everywhere and when that got averaged in trump took  percent of the votes nationwide even with the stolen votes subtracted from the average the fbi fox cnn everyone else knew the gig was up and is now only moving to say sorry so they dont go to jail 

well ive got news for you they are still the same lying despicable malfunctioning trash scum they always were they showed their worth and we would be idiots to forgive them no matter how badly they burn hillary 

cnn is despicable trash we all witnessed it never forgive them  because they have proven their worth already no matter what they do they cant recover from what they have done they are garbage a disease bleachworthy filth and i hope trump erases them ditto for all of the rest of the msm including the huffington post snopes abccbsfoxyounameit  all of them are the lowest of filth that is now heading for the darkness of the nearest sewer to get away from the coming bulldozer 

the fbi is a trash agency along with the rest of american intelligence which only works to serve the enemy for as long as it thinks its head will not be cut off all of the fbi must be disbanded and everyone in the fbi should be blackballed and never allowed to work again with the top echelons jailed for life for treason they lied about  and they knew it  and have proven they serve one purpose to protect evil ditto for the cia the nsa the dhs the tsa and all the rest of the trash all of it needs to go there is not one fragment of it that should be salvaged 

so they are all running like rats for cover they know they blew it they know they are going to be bagged for heinous crimes against america now they are putting on the biggest fakest show the world will ever witness as if they cared they never did care and i hope to god trump has a memory longer than the average jarhead and bags every last one of them when he has his day they had better run for the gates and ditch the country just like they said they would if he got elected  because if not they are heading straight to the gates of justice 

i would like to thank everyone in the altmedia who made this happen and i would also like to say that i said it all along as it was and never backed off hillary never had more than  percent national support this is something i said repeatedly that trump was always  percent supported and i never wavered and never once posted bullshit like oh lets rejoice trump is at  percent that was always a trap  a scam to justify stealing the election  and i called it as it was 

our job is not over 

the rot is there it is deeply rooted with fungus roots running all the way through the country one bottle of bleach is not going to do more than spotclean the surface we won this battle and it is not time to sit down the altmedia cannot rest until cnn and all of the rest of the msm is either bankrupted or jailed the altmedia cannot rest for as long as google is allowed to wage war on websites like this one by refusing to allow it ads if this website were allowed ads it would easily selffund with  plus per month and would probably have more than  per month denial of ads just because someone disagrees and has a monopoly established via full control of various ad firms is a flagrant violation of antitrust laws and has to be stopped dead cold 

the altmedia cannot stop until every last criminal in the fbi is jailed by the fbi i am sick of the bait tactics and false flag psyops fronted by that agency heads have got to roll piles of them especially since it has been proven that it was the fbi itself that did the first world trade center bombing with the full intent to bring one of the towers down thats the type of agency that has got to be shuttered  or we are all toast trump or not yeah i know you at the fbi are reading this go to hell 

our job will not be over until the cia is cleaned out our job is not over until the american bar association is disbanded as the criminal bloodsucking hive it is our job is not over until the top executives at the medical companies that produced the tainted autisminflicting vaccines hang with stretched necks our job will not be over until every last liberal arts and womens studies department of all universities have their staffs jailed for treason they gutted the home front in a manner which was horrific beyond belief our job is not over until all of americas great libraries are fully restored after being totally wiped out by the jews and all scientific journals and works once again become fully free and public domain our job will not be over until the childsnatching cps is shut down and their feed for their slave trade is cut off our job will not be over until american corporations begin to fight for america and bring our jobs and american quality back 

the list of what the altmedia needs to accomplish now that it appears the first huge battle has been won is practically endless but i believe the altmedia is up to the task and will succeed as long as one thing is cemented in stone 



julian assange is obviously dead 

consider these facts and then figure the odds of him being alive 

 wikileaks dns server was suddenly pointed elsewhere thats right that night in the wee hours of the morning after pamela was there to poison him police in an armored vehicle showed up at the embassy and that night the dns server pointed to a different ip address for wikileaks and google updated everything instantly so the transfer was completely seamless from the real wikileaks server to the fake wikileaks server that was at a completely different ip address 

 mr assanges subsequent tweets were noticeably more hostile and attacked his most loyal supporters i reported this repeatedly 

 mr assanges tweets regularly misspelled the names of some of his closest friends whom he has known for decades gavin mcfadyen became mcfayden for example mcfadyen  the director of wikileaks was found dead three days after assange started having mystery problems this is something i made a huge issue of here 

 streams of disinformation were spewed 

 themes supported by mr assange for years were then knocked down or discredited by his subsequent tweets and communications very bad timing with that everyone with a brain noticed this and it lit up the forums and blogs 

 body double rumors have been circulated and documented 

 new strange hitherto unknown moderators of wikileaks have suddenly been installed 

 his deadman switch was activated before the armored vehicle even showed up at the embassy which means assange probably manually triggered it after he figured out he was poisoned much of his stored data and secret website pins were to be released in the event of his untimely death i released both deadman switches here one encrypted and one unencrypted 

all of this happened right after pamela anderson showed up with a lunch that was no doubt poisoned and the media talked all about how assange was pale and not feeling well when she left and that he said the food pamela brought him was torture good for a laugh in the inside circles to have this go out on the msm no doubt 

my take assange was poisoned and then removed from the embassy in an armored vehicle this was clearly visible in a live feed someone set up that night because something was amiss and i saw that and stayed up the entire night for it that is why i so strongly stated that he cant possibly still be at the embassy perhaps he got medical care to save him and is now being waterboarded 

if the new wikileak releases are real they are not coming from the wikileaks server  only a redirect to a different server in the name of wikileaks the ip address change proves it and we can only hope it is white hats doing it it seems so but one can only guess

conspiracy theories have swirled in recent days as to why fbi director james comey reopened hillarys email investigation after just closing it back in july concluding that although hillary had demonstrated gross negligence in her establishment of a private email server that no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against her democrats after lavishing comey with praise for months on concluding his investigation in an impartial way have since lashed out at him for seeking to influence the  election cycle with hillary herself describing his recent actions as deeply troubling republicans on the other hand have praised comeys recent efforts as an attempt to correct a corrupt investigation that seemingly ignored critical evidence while granting numerous immunity agreements to clinton staffers 

according to the daily mail  and a source close to james comey the decision at least in part came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the fbi who felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist 
james comeys decision to revive the investigation of hillary clintons email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the fbi  including some of his top deputies according to a source close to the embattled fbi director 

the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source a close friend who has known comey for nearly two decades shares family outings with him and accompanies him to catholic mass every week 

some people including department heads stopped talking to jim and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall said the source they felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist 

according to the source comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife patrice 

he told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom 

the people he trusts the most have been the angriest at him the source continued and that includes his wife pat she kept urging him to admit that he had been wrong when he refused to press charges against the former secretary of state though were sure there are many facets behind comeys decision making process we can all be quite certain at this point that hes not motivated by a desire to make friends having now alienated just about everyone in washington both in law enforcement and in both political parties in fact after tim kaine just last week praised comey as a wonderful career public servant with the highest standards of integrity

87,no title,"breaking bombshell fbi nypd insiders leak  email scandal about to take a sick and twisted turn    
source victurus libertas  


all of the following information was given to us by our insiders who have specific firsthand knowledge of the hillary clinton email scandal it seems that things are about to heat up we are told that of the  emails lifted from anthony weiners computer  emails are huma abedins and pay to play  including saudis and israelis meaning huma was the one hillary used to communicate with foreign leaders via email for inside information and deals via humas computer 

it has been established through many avenues but mainly through wikileaks that the clinton foundation was just a farce set up in order to perform paytoplay games with multiple entities including foreign nations paytoplay nations include israel saudi arabia turkey qatar kazakhstan and the ukraine 
furthermore we are told by one of our insiders that one email unequivocally confirms isis was created by cia and israeli secret intelligence service  with help from joe lieberman john mccain and lindsey graham an nypd insider said the content they viewed did include state department top secret emails one file was called life insurance a second file was titled  dnc nuclear arsenal  

a third file im sure hillary definitely does not want released was a file labeled intimate  according to this nypd insider this file contained xrated photos of huma and hillary with a teenager  

nypd detectives were sickened by what they saw according to our insider and they had threatened fbi field agents that they would leak this information if the fbi did not step up and take off the kid gloves  at that point  of the fbi agents in nyc were also threatening to leak the information 

as you can imagine the scandal has the entire obama administration in full panic we are told there are emails that could send loretta lynch to prison  as well as bill and hillary the twitter post below our sources sent us verifying it is all true 




even more 

the following information comes straight from an fbi anonymous source who is the senior analyst who posted on chan in early july of this year 

jim comey learned that some of his own investigators were tipping off both loretta lynch and bill clinton thus making his job impossible 

comey sent a letter to congress knowing that ultimately it would expose loretta lynch as a dirty actor and the breadcrumbs would lead directly to obama  the state department is terrified now comey has assembled a small team of  agents whom he has declared the untouchables after the famous federal agent eliot ness 

comey has clamped down on all fbi agents and he expects a fullscale war between the fbi and the department of justice doj the white house and the state department he has confirmed and understands that many sitting senators congressmen lobbyists and power players are going to be indicted and prosecuted  one of the main targets of the probe is the clinton foundation and clinton global initiative among the targets under investigation are john podesta huma cheryl mills cnn abc nbc etc 

as it turns out weiner humas husband had been forwarding humas emails each time she came home and left her computer open huma appears to have been in touch with saudi actors and therefore espionage is strongly suspected 
comey and his   untouchables  are now preparing to take down the largest corruption ever witnessed in american history which is what i think must happen if comey is planning to stay part of the fbi he lost so much respect and so much credibility with the first hillary investigation it would take something of this magnitude to allow him to face the public again the pentagon has internal players and outside players they call  creatives  creatives are civilians who tend to be geniuses malcontents extreme hackers or otherwise demonstrate brilliance in other useful areas a pentagon program called cicada   which we have reported on previously was created by several of these talented civilians the program is now used to allow thousands of honest government people to report on their corrupt superiors using what is called a dead box whistleblower encryption method so the noncorrupted government officials can report corruption and still remain safe 

ive heard it said a vagina almost took down bill now will a weiner take down hillary lol 

again thank you to all of the insiders the whistleblowers the good fbi agents the good cia agents the good nypd officers and the noncorrupted government officials who want to see the truth exposed without these brave wonderful and morally erect individuals our country would still be in the corrupted darkness

wikileaks raised serious ethical concerns about the clinton foundation when it published a hacked email send to clinton campaign chairman john podesta revealing blurred lines between the foundation and the personal financial interests of bill and hillary clinton 

cannabis party leader julian crawford said if john key was serious about hiv prevention one of the clinton foundations supposed goals he should legalise medical cannabis in new zealand 

hundreds of researchers have reported that thc was able to destroy the riv virus in monkeys that virus is nearly identical to the hiv virus found in humans he said 

john key has a lot of explaining to do if the wikileaks revelations about the clinton foundation are true 

former assistant director of the fbi thomas fuentes confirmed that the fbi has an intensive investigation ongoing into the clinton foundation 

new zealands national business review has reported that john key will continue giving millions of dollars of taxpayers money to the foundation in the future despite the criminal investigation of hillary clinton 

ive met her on lots of occasions had dinner with her at premier house a few times john key said 

as secretary of state she was great very engaged with new zealand broadcaster duncan garner yesterday raised serious concerns about the ongoing payments to the clinton foundation known as paytoplay 

we also give money to the clinton foundation yes we did gosh who didnt get a handout garner said 

weve been feeding all these guys at the trough for years 

paytoplay refers to operations where bill and hillary clinton rewarded big donors to their foundation with preferential access to the us government

wikileaks raised serious ethical concerns about the clinton foundation when it published a hacked email send to clinton campaign chairman john podesta revealing blurred lines between the foundation and the personal financial interests of bill and hillary clinton 

cannabis party leader julian crawford said if john key was serious about hiv prevention one of the clinton foundations supposed goals he should legalise medical cannabis in new zealand 

hundreds of researchers have reported that thc was able to destroy the riv virus in monkeys that virus is nearly identical to the hiv virus found in humans he said 

john key has a lot of explaining to do if the wikileaks revelations about the clinton foundation are true 

former assistant director of the fbi thomas fuentes confirmed that the fbi has an intensive investigation ongoing into the clinton foundation 

new zealands national business review has reported that john key will continue giving millions of dollars of taxpayers money to the foundation in the future despite the criminal investigation of hillary clinton 

ive met her on lots of occasions had dinner with her at premier house a few times john key said 

as secretary of state she was great very engaged with new zealand broadcaster duncan garner yesterday raised serious concerns about the ongoing payments to the clinton foundation known as paytoplay 

we also give money to the clinton foundation yes we did gosh who didnt get a handout garner said 

weve been feeding all these guys at the trough for years 

paytoplay refers to operations where bill and hillary clinton rewarded big donors to their foundation with preferential access to the us government

humas husband anthony weiner which blows the whole humaislam meme into the gutter all we are seeing with this is the fact the muslims running saudi arabia are crypto jews  anyway  hillary was so sure shed never be called to account with her emails that she was careless enough to have them end up on weiners personal laptop in a file he titled life insurance 

well you know how the entire establishment is wrapped up in child sex and other similar crimes and weiner ended up getting his laptop seized by the nypd in a kiddie pornchild sex investigation when the nypd went through the laptop they found hillarys emails in full unadulterated pristine form they proved crimes of the highest order  at least  felonies found so far with a majority of them related to treason and selling out the country 

so the nypd opened up a case on hillary the fbi said no well take that  and that is the only reason why these investigations got reopened because if the nypd handled it huge portions of the fbi would be sent to prison now the fbi is under pressure to actually do its job because they know the nypd knows no matter what the outcome the fbi gains zero  zero credibility points from this 

so read my report do not forgive  it was bang on they did this because they had to not because they had any intention at all of being good and it really is time to drain the swamp 

now lets all sit and wait for the suicide of preet bharara  the us prosecuting attorney for the southern district of new york and the nypd who pushed this into the light hes now a target of the fbi the dnc the clinton death machine and god knows what else prediction and i do not make predictions the director of investigations for the nypd will commit suicide within  days hes a walking dead man 

the circle of crime in washington dc is so entrenched and so intertwined that if you poke one part of it there is a good chance the whole show will fall apart poking that monster in a way that hurts is something i do not believe anyone will survive preet might as well call himself a zombie 

the nypd trumped the fbi that is why they had to investigate hillary 

well well the nypd is what busted the hillary mails open while they were looking for kiddie stuff on weiners laptop and that is why the fbi was forced to investigate hillary they had no choice nypd trumps fbi

 john podesta kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who kept me out of jail 

 podesta and kadzik the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show 

 both were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign 

 kadzik lobbied podesta  then wh chief of staff  to pardon his billionaire tax dodger fugitive client marc rich whose wife gave  million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon fbi director james comey is now trying to do the right thing and correct the deed cleaning up the mud he and hillary clinton put all over the face of fbi agency by reopening hillary clintons case thanks to kemails linked to sex scandal of huma abedins husband anthony weiner and the mutiny of fbi agents who wont put up with comeys crap we are suppose to finally get justice 

but guess what doj assigned a clinton ally and john podestas very close friend peter kadzik to take charge of the new investigation 

in a letter to congress the doj writes that it will continue to work closely with the fbi and together dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible assistant attorney general peter j kadzik writes in letters to house and senate lawmakers 

who is peter kadzik 

according to an excellent article published by daily caller 

the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october john podesta the democrats campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends including peter kadzik a top official at the justice department 

the dinner arrangement revealed in hacked podesta emails released by wikileaks is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of states email practices 


podesta and kadzik the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show in one email from january kadzik and podesta who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign 

the postbenghazi dinner was attended by podesta kadzik superlobbyist vincent roberti and other wellplaced beltway fixtures 

kadzik who started at the doj in  helped spearhead the effort to nominate lynch who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president 

in the trenches 

podesta and kadzik have a long history  one which has largely gone unnoticed during the ongoing clinton email scandal 

kadzik represented podesta during the monica lewinsky investigation and in the waning days of the bill clinton administration kadzik lobbied podesta on behalf of marc rich the fugitive who bill clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office 

that history is cited by podesta in another email hacked from his gmail account 

in a sept  email  which the washington free beacon flagged last week podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign 

podesta who would later head up the obama white house transition effort wrote that kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who kept me out of jail 

podesta had been promoted to clintons chief of staff when he and kadzik became embroiled in another scandal 

kadzik was then representing marc rich a billionaire financier who was wanted by the us government for evading a  million tax bill the fugitive who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism had been living in switzerland for  years when he sought the pardon 

to help rich kadzik lobbied podesta heavily in the weeks before clinton left office on jan   

a house oversight committee report released in may  stated that kadzik was recruited into marc richs lobbying campaign because he was a longtime friend of white house chief of staff john podesta 

the report noted that kadzik contacted podesta at least seven times regarding richs pardon 

on top of the allhandsondeck lobbying effort richs exwife denise rich had doled out more than  million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon she gave  to hillary clintons new york senate campaign and another  to the clinton presidential library

107,no title,link hey people i always enjoy your threads though i think you focus too much on a singular belief issue or pattern and then it becomes self affirming for you in your research first this but voices actual voices in your head is always mental illness sorry maybe a stress reaction not to be judgmental happens to the best and such just really not what i am trying to convey here though i believe you are quite intelligent i dont think you are qualified exactly to make that wholesale definitive judgement you even contradict that by referencing dr vinods channeling of the nine in  channeling by definition from dictionarycom means in one sense the practice of professedly entering a meditative or trancelike state in order to convey messages from a spiritual guide surely this process would involve the sensory structure of hearing i dont wish to debate voice to skull tech with you because i dont sense this is really what your thread is about but there have been lawsuits waged and won over such technology being used to harass people who dont test as schizophrenic or any other dsm related diagnosis that would explain auditory hallucinations indicating mental illness now thats not to say that anyone hearing voices is being technologically harassed but saying definitively its always mental illness does a disservice to the search for knowledge and stopping such technology being used on people link to lawsuit psychotronic weaponsspace preservation acthouse resolution bill brain manipulation from a distance last year in october the congressman dennis j kucinich introduced in the american congress a bill obliging the american president to get engaged in the negotiations aimed at the ban of space based weapons in this bill the definition of a weapon system includes any other unacknowledged or as yet undeveloped means inflicting death or injury on or damaging or destroying a person or the biological life bodily health mental health or physical and economic wellbeing of a person through the use of landbased seabased or spacebased systems using radiation electromagnetic psychotronic sonic laser or other energies directed at individual persons or targeted populations or the purpose of information war mood management or mind control of such persons or populations  as in all legislative acts quoted in this article the bill counts with sound light or electromagnetic stimulation of human brain psychotronic weapons remain at least for a layman uninformed of secret military research in the sphere of science fiction since so far none of the published scientific experiments was presented in the way which would allow for its replication that it is feasible to manipulate human behavior with the use of subliminal either sound or visual messages is now generally known this is why in most of the countries the use of such technologies without consent of the user is banned devices using light for the stimulation of the brain show another way how the light flashing in certain frequencies could be used for the manipulation of human psychic life as for the sound a report on the device transmitting a beam of sound waves which can hear only persons at whom the beam of sound waves is targeted appeared last year in the world newspapers the beam is formed by a combination of sound and ultrasound waves which causes that a person targeted by this beam hears the sound inside of his head such a perception could easily convince the human being that it is mentally ill the acts presented in this article suggest that with the development of technology and knowledge of the functioning of human brain new ways of manipulation of human mind keep emerging one of them seems to be the electromagnetic energy though in the open scientific literature only some  experiments were published supporting this assumption  already in  in the ussr after successful testing with military unit in novosibirsk the installation radioson radiosleep was registered with the government committee on the matters of inventions and discoveries of the ussr described as a method of induction of sleep by means of radio waves     dear senatorattorney letter included we seek your offices assistance in initiating hearings and a factfinding congressional inquiry into the government agencies andor private companies that are targeting citizens many citizens are desperate to be freed from the disturbing intrusive and oppressive targeting evidence supports the conclusion that weapons exist that could be used against individuals based on us patent and trademark office filings public releases by agencies and other technologies that indicate the level of technological sophistication the weapons are believed to be based on electromagnetism microwaves sonic waves lasers and other types of directed energy and were characterized as psychotronic in rep dennis kucinichs draft of house resolution  the space preservation act of  furthermore it is undeniable that government agencies have tested citizens without permission in the past for example the cias human experimentation discussed in orlikow v us  fsupp  ddc  secretly administered lysergic acid diethylamide discussed in united states v stanley  us   and military chemical experimentation as discussed in congressional committee report  d congress d session s prt  dec   lastly the sheer numbers of people complaining of being targeted including people with postgraduate degrees and a lifetime of achievements and the similarities in symptoms tend to outweigh a dismissive response based on charges of anecdotal evidence or group paranoia there is a certain risk of sounding too conspiratorial however common denominators such as physical symptoms and medical reports surveillance scenarios harassment techniques and more can be readily established i highly recommend reading in full the details of this lawsuit containing a great deal of verifiable information the military has admitted for some time to having at the least a non lethal lol weapon called active denial but this rabbit hole goes much much deeper having said all that as ive said before in one of your threads i think it wise to consider that its not just one thing or another its many things there could be aliens for instance and then there could be milabs leaving the person with the memory of an alien abduction rather than their being used for human experimentation which is supposed to be against our constitution and most certainly against our human rights and then people can also suffer from temporal lobe seizure like hallucinations but one must also remember that these can most certainly be induced artificially as well in short i think your rabbit hole is only making it to the gopher level regards,2016-11-01

dark chilly and moonless night about pm or so we had tucked ourselves in our sleeping bags and had a really good spot elevated with no distractions to look at the night sky i had excellent vision then and could see pretty danged good i was  my friend was  he partook of the herb and drank beer daily and i consumed a few beers daily by nightfall we were tuckered out and wanted nothing more than to just go to sleep the heat of the west texas day really took it out of us the campsite was only accessed by boat we used a rental canoe so we paddled our way to this place that was a fairly large and very rugged rocky peninsula with some cliffs being  foot high they seemed a lot taller to me we camped on the top of the cliffs at night and played down on the water by day so this one night i was looking at a particular spot up there above us and he was looking at another i then saw it and said look right there he having binoculars he looked at where i had pointed saw it and got pretty excited he finally let me look at it through his binoculars and what i saw was the following slightly larger than what we normally see a satellite was a transparent or semitransparent and faint bluish looking sphere a clear bubble really moving at a speed i remember as being slightly faster than what a satellite would be going but not so much faster or slower than any planejet traffic would be in my estimation it was going south and we watched it by passing the binoculars back and forth we both assumed it was a satellite exciting stuff but then one of us i really cant remember who noticed another one this time coming from the east they appeared to be on a course that appeared to us that would be really a close call if they were at the same altitude when they were getting a little too close for comfort at least for us the one that came from the east shot a light bluish light at the southbound sphere it wasnt laserlike at all i dont think but it appeared more like a vshaped beam from a flashlight shot at it it lasted all of a second and i am positive that it happened due to we both saw it at the same time the light flash made the southbound one turn westward now going almost the same direction as the one from the east making them both going in the same direction actually the one that got flashed didnt make a  degree turn it was really going more of a path more like westsouthwest more like  degrees or so just guessing now when i say that it turned it turned abruptly not at all anything like any plane would do that struck us both as being odd no curving involved at all we watched them until they both grew dim from the distance both staying in a straight line to their intended destination of course we kept thinking that the one that flashed the beam would turn and follow the other but nope i could be wrong on the speed and the directions but the rest is completely accurate the really sharp turn back then was unheard of we hear it all of the time now years ago though it wasnt talked about at all not even in the tabloids this is why this really stood out out to me all of these years that almost  degree turn to be honest i just didnt understand what we had just seen we finally got to sleep that night i dont know how long it took us but we did but after a few hours around ish am robert woke me up and said listen and i heard footsteps that scared us pretty good cause we had gotten so worked up earlier i guess heheh we listened to the small branches and small gravel rocks moving beneath whatever it was that was about to kill us well we did until we finally scared ourselves to sleep i have to admit ok yeah i did partake myself but only a little bit i wasnt into it like him but i was on vacation that made us both very paranoid i guess anyway the next morning we found our bread and peanut butter missing the breads plastic wrapper was there but no bread creepy a few years later my boss who i had told all of this to and he made fun of me told me that the same thing happened to him his peanut butter and bread went missing while camped on a river they determined that it was a raccoon which they do this sort of thing i know now now to regular people that might not seem like much especially now days here on this forum more spectacular claims are made daily still for back then it was really something my older brother by  years and i were camping with no tent underneath the starry sky of caddo lake in east texas around  in the spring may i think and we were looking at a patch of sky surrounded by silhouetted trees actually talking about when we were kids looking for flying saucers thats all they were known as back then our entire family would look out at the sky in our backyard it was a common thing for us to do back in the fifties after all that was its heyday as we stared at the sky in the back of my pickup i mentioned the bluish sphere that i had seen years before at possum kingdom lake he being quiet through the entire story he wasnt that talkative really and within  minutes of me mentioning this to him we saw one i had my own binoculars this time i was really amazed it was exactly as what i had seen before i mean exactly nothing major happened though it just quietly slid across the sky in front of us and disappeared behind the trees to our right and that was that my brother was never a believer anyway maybe had it landed it would change his mind we saw several regular ol satellites afterwards too why i even bring this up is that when i first started coming here around  lurking i read a thread of a guy here that saw the exact thing i did with the slightly vshaped flashlight looking beam and the other blue sphere turning away id really love to read that again it was a good feeling to be somewhat confirmed i say confirmed because that friend robert that witnessed the sphere denied it in front of a lot of people at work we hardly talked about anything else on that trip and especially on the way home too assuming he felt as i did i brought it up when a bunch of guys were taking a break at work maybe  people i didnt see the harm in telling what we saw after i said my piece i said ask robert robert said i was crazy and he didnt see a thing i thought he was kidding but he was being serious youd think that on the way back hed say that he wasnt wanting to tell anyone but nooo edit on  by

117,little blue balls,russia puzzled by norways decision to host us marines page  link norway is to break a decadesold commitment not to host foreign troops on its soil by accommodating  us marines next year russia the apparent target of the buildup said it was puzzled by the move the marines will be stationed at the vaernes military base in central norway from january the norwegian defense ministry said in a statement on monday the agreement for the deployment will be reviewed in the course of the year it added source i was one of the few posters on this forum who expressed that norways decision to have marines deployed on its home soil was significant part of the reason i believe it is significant is russias reaction to the move our opinions mean nothing in this matter if russia considers the move to be significant then its significant i wonder if posters will be able to put aside their egos for this thread and not focus on their view of this issue but focus on russias view quoting from the article linked above the deployment appears to be in line with natos strategy to boost its military presence close to russias borders the alliance decided to send four strong battalions each to poland and the baltic states claiming it was needed to deter russia please put it all in context from russias point of view edit on  by profusion because no reason given,2016-10-26

119,russia puzzled by norways decision to host us marines,why isnt observer evidence like eyewitness accounts counted as evidence for ufos page  link eyewitness accounts have been used by science for years newton used eyewtiness accounts in the principia when talking about comets he came up with a theory on comets based on recorded sighting throughout the world like a boy saw a comet and this is what he described there wasnt any internet to even verify the credibility of these eyewitness accounts yet newton used them to come up with a theory about comets which helped lead to his equations of gravity so if eyewitness accounts are so unreliable how did newton use them to come up with his theories we also saw this with meteorites this is from wiki although meteors have been known since ancient times they were not known to be an astronomical phenomenon until early in the th century prior to that they were seen in the west as an atmospheric phenomenon like lightning and were not connected with strange stories of rocks falling from the sky in  yale university chemistry professor benjamin silliman investigated a meteorite that fell in weston connecticut silliman believed the meteor had a cosmic origin but meteors did not attract much attention from astronomers until the spectacular meteor storm of november  people all across the eastern united states saw thousands of meteors radiating from a single point in the sky astute observers noticed that the radiant as the point is now called moved with the stars staying in the constellation leo astute observers saw meteors radiating from a single point in the sky and to this day this is still called the radient i thought science never uses eyewitness accounts also heres a list of published papers and studies on ufos this page offers a list of  articles papers and monographs about ufos  uaps published in professional journals and specialty publications two polls of professional  amateur astronomers respectively on whether they see ufos or not finally  phd dissertations and academic publications about ufos very little peerreviewed literature has been published in which academics have proposed studied or supported nonprosaic explanations for ufos wwwhypernet why arent there more nonprosaic explanations of ufos that alone lends support to the notion that extraterrestrial visitation has occurred i have had  sightings myself two looked like probes it was real windy one day and the wind was almost knocking me over then this round orb passed in front of me going against the wind it slowed down and then it sped back up where are all the scientist explaining ufos why are there still these unidentified objects in the sky we have aeriel phenomena in the sky that can avoid radar outrun our best planes and cause nuclear facilities to malfunction after  or more years of these sightings why cant scientist explain these things like newton did with comets based on eyewitness accounts or what happened with metorites heres  eyewitness accounts,2016-10-26
120,the influencing machine and magnus olsens blood,watch up mission impossible against voter registration to make trump win starts from indiana page  the peace of god to all that belong to the light dear readers a so serious and suspicious move in indiana today is practically leaving  voters the major part of which are african american possibly out of any possibility to vote this november th presidential election this following instructions of the vice presidential republican nominee and governor of the state mike pence please read thinkprogressorg patriot majority alleges the investigation and raid were political moves and that lawson worked closely with gov mike pence r who has pushed the voter fraud conspiracy on the campaign trail alongside donald trump weve seen nothing but partisan activity from the secretary of state and even from the police buck said they saw that there was a very successful voter registration drive happening and this was an attempt to shut it down its clear that the governor or the governors staff are very aware and involved in whats happening he continued it fits into the trumppence narrative that in certain neighborhoods you have to watch how many times people show up to vote and how things happen if this situation is not fully clarified in the following hours we could see in the general election how trump will probably take indiana with a really small margin of votes by blocking these voters to be able to express their decision freely all this operation of today is part of carefully designed republican strategy to use the excuse of a possible fraud to justify arbitrary measures that will prevent many americans to elect the next president is a political boycott of the general election please check theinterceptcom this is an red alert to all voters that oppose donald trump to watch carefully the behavior and decisions taken by the republican governors to try to favor their candidate they saw that there was a very successful voter registration drive happening and this was an attempt to shut it down please check wwwdailykoscom the thread is open not only to discuss this so dark operation but also to invite other members of ats community to report irregularities of any kind that are right now taking place to assure that on november who become elected will be president not because it has really the support of the majority but because thousands of americans are going to be deprived of their right to vote voter registration drives across the country follow similar protocol without being subject to investigations a huffington post investigation reported that it seems the extraordinary investigation is likely to find no more than potential technical violations of obscure regulations for thirdparty voter registration groups thanks for your attention,2016-10-26
121,why isnt observer evidence like eyewitness accounts counted as evidence for ufos,link donald trump could have a disability that used to be known as aspergers and this can cause people trouble when they try to socialize because their theory of mind is not complete basically they have trouble thinking of how others perceive their actions these people tend to be highly intelligent trumps iq is  which makes sense considering he has built more businesses than most of us have and although he could have invested his fathers money and made the same amount back as he did in the end through business deals he put a lot of work and thought into his business i would like to know what kind of medicines trump is on and what his mental health diagnosis are if he has aspergers then that would explain why he makes so many social mistakes being super rich from a young age might also account for it since he would not be trained to interact with people on an equal level which is a lot more complicated than interacting with people when you are rich and they are poor however an article in the new york times recently focused on trumps fears of making social blunders he has a fear of losing social status or being embarrassed publicly however he doesnt seem to do well publicly which must be a disability because he would want to be a good public speaker and not make social gaffes yet he still does it it must be accidental donald even stated he is a difficult man to be married to which means he knows himself and his weaknesses many people with aspergers dont get married because they have a hard time in relationships,2016-10-26

124,nanobots causing overwhelming depression not far off the end now,it seems there isnt going to be a halloween writing contest so i thought i would post the story i preemptively wrote for it i hope you enjoy it master of the estate this coach really is quite wonderful jonathan i can barely feel the bumps and i dont feel like im about to be thrown out the window eleanor exclaimed it is grand isnt it its all grand the trip our coachand you she said smiling and snuggling in closer to jonathan on the wide leather seat i could do without this fog though i would like to see the moon and stars later tonight he pulled the curtain aside slightly with a gloved hand and peered mournfully through the window at the white mist that nearly obscured everything he could hardly see the tops of the trees it was so thick just then a particularly large bump jostled them roughly followed closely by another oh squealed eleanor jonathans brow drew down driver he called out the window is everything alright beg pardon sir i fear i may have taken a wrong turn at that fork back a ways theres a house up aheadill check in with them and make sure sturbridge village cant be far now and were better safe than sorry with this fog rolling in if you take my meaning sir dont want to be out past dark in this soup jonathan looked at eleanor well it would be nice to stretch our legs for a moment she said she was not quite as cheerful as she had been just minutes ago the october afternoon was cooling off as evening approached and jonathan could see his breath the coach trundled past wellmaintained stone gables and a heavy wroughtiron gate standing open on one side oil lanterns hung from black hooks in the gables glowed dimly in the fog and additional lanterns spilled pools of yelloworange light on a cobblestone drive as they made their way up toward the house eleanor gasped as the massive shape of the house came into view its beautiful jonathan made a surprised hm but otherwise said nothing a welldressed footman dashed out to lower the stairs of their coach and open the door then offered a whitegloved hand to eleanor as she peered out with a flashed smile at jonathan she accepted the young mans hand and descended the driver was speaking quietly with another footman and an older man emerged from the heavy oak door of the house as jonathan descended the steps of the coach the older man  clearly the butler  bowed to eleanor and jonathan welcome to the anne union keyes estate i am mister walker and i am at your service the master of the estate has invited you in for the evening meal the butler spoke with some kind of british accent but beyond that jonathan not say from where exactly good lord man we just arrived unannounced yes sir but herr von graeff enjoys entertaining and was notified of your arrival as you drove up i would be honored if you would follow me he gestured toward the polished steps eleanor was the type of woman who once her mind was made up proceeded without hesitation she must have decided they were staying for dinner for with a delighted squeal she headed for the house they were greeted in the foyer by an elderly man jonathan estimated he was in his seventies hair fully white with deep creases in his face on age showing on his hands however the man was tall and straightbacked and he carried himself proudly there was a stiffness to his movements and he used a cane to walk but when jonathan shook his large hands the mans grip was as firm as a man half his age welcome he said warmly and with what jonathan thought was a german accent i am gottfried hansjürgen von graeff please be welcome in my home how may i call you the mans eyes were unusual but jonathan could not place what it was about them that seemed so he shrugged it off thank you herr von graeff i am jonathan rockport this is my fiancée eleanor harrington we really have only stopped to find our way back to the highway we are trying to get to sturbridge village to stay for the night before continuing on to fall river in the morning ah yes well you will not make it to sturbridge village in this fog herr von graeff pronounced the name of the town with a sh sound at least not before dark

would like to press on if possible i have business meetings in massachusetts and must be in fall river by tuesday  ah a wonderful town fall river yes tell me how is the new railway doing i understand

140,tonopah test range google earth imagery,link hello again ats though we are two weeks out from election day as i sit to write these words  i find myself already looking beyond tuesday november the eighth and at some of the things that i think will happen between now and  as well as what i think the landscape will look like in the year leading up to that years election it wont be a popular opinion here on ats i am sure but as of today i feel confident in saying that short of some unprecedented and wholly unforseeable revelation or event  this years election is very likely a done deal hillary clinton will almost certainly be the next president of the united states with just two weeks remaining before election day  as of this writing  the metaanalysis of polls shows clinton possessing nearly an insurmountable lead while it is true that trump enjoys a very passionate and enthusiastic base he has done little to successfully expand that base the potential for him to find a means of connecting with undecided and uncommitted voters is minimal and shrinks with each passing day having come to this view i find myself free to look beyond the coming weeks and to try and get a handle on what a post  world will look like frankly gazing into my allegorical crystal ball i see dark and threatening clouds gathering on our horizon clouds that could very well bring a storm of epic proportions our way election night blues the night of tuesday november the eighth could well be historic  in the worst of ways this election cycle has broken several taboos and lowered the bar of political discourse in unprecedented ways it has been a season of highly divisive hyperbole and rhetoric that has builtup a great deal of social tension we currently sit atop a very very dry powder keg of anger that is seething and highly volatile passions will be flaring among many as we watch the election results stream in on our televisions computers and phones many of those watching will be deeply deeply emotionally invested in the outcome of this race in this climactic moment we as a nation will be perilously close to critical mass one spark away from potential disaster four years ago a man with some degree of fame was emotionally invested in that years election and he took to social media twitter to vent his reactions in a paroxysmal spasm of emotion that minor celebrity was one donald j trump source imagine for a moment what could happen if history repeats itself and this same man goes on a similar rant this election night imagine the violence such a display could potentially trigger then stop imagining and take a deep breath such a reaction is not just possible  given the evidence it is more than likely the probable outcome trump is currently heavily invested in telling his followers that the election is rigged that they have no voice and that he is the only one who can save them this is a very very dangerous and unstable bit of social chemistry most trump supporters obviously will not lash out in violence if their candidate loses the race  even if they personally feel that the outcome of the election was not legitimate however some trump supporters those in the extremes of what the media is currently calling the alt right very well could take to the streets in rage given some of the fringe support that trump enjoys i would honestly be surprised if such things were not already being planned by a handful of those on the fringe the rhetoric of revolution has been abused of late  and there are always the few who take such statements far too literally across the line blunty put  if election night comes and trump loses  and if he takes to twitter as he did four years ago  it could well result in a very long and bloody night a catastrophic night that we will look back upon with shame a night that could well poison our nation for years to come much ado about trump tv many pundits and wonks have mused over the fact that it truly does appear that trump has been laying the groundwork for a future media operation presumably a news network or service of some kind i count myself among those who have been suggesting so for a fairly long time however where i differ is that i dont see it as being quite so cut and dry any longer while i do think that trumps original thoughts  or more the thoughts of those who influence trump  was to create a new media conservative news venue i think that its now grown into something more i think that trump tv  or whatever they end up calling it  trump tv is too generic theres no inherent propaganda value in the name i think something more like trumps maga network is probably more on point  will be used as a device to begin a new political party more accurately to succeed where others have previously failed  im looking at you sarah palin and glenn beck  by congealing the various patriot tea party and fringe right wing groups into one collective and singular entity  a party firmly rooted in extreme nationalism with enough religion and conservatism thrown in to gain wider appeal my prediction is that donald trump will remain the focal point and figurehead of this coming movement  using this new network much as he currently utilizes his twitter feed a platform for him to vent his late night frustrations angers and insecurities his name will be predominantly used in the branding and messaging and trump will be the face of it all the most frequent speaker and guest imagine if the apprentice had been a  live streaming show  and trump had the power to walk in at any moment to say whatever happened to be on his mind that is how i see trump tv however i dont see trump being the driving force behind the actual message trump is a brand after all he has made his place in this world by putting his name on buildings he didnt build shows that he didnt create and ideas he didnt originate trump works as a spokesperson  the guy who says im not only the president of but im also a member the real people behind the curtain will be the mercers  robert and rebekah  steve bannon and to a lesser degree roger ailes as for on camera talents i think the current obvious potential faces of this new media enterprise will be hannity oreilly and lahren  though im honestly not personally sure if oreilly will make the jump money is money after all and big daddy bill is sitting pretty comfortably atop the fox news heap as his career winds down regardless however of who wins the backstage power war  other than the mercers who are a lock  and the on camera positions the network itself will be the propaganda arm of the extreme right wing and i think it very well could end up pulling the national discourse much further to the right in the coming  years particularly with the subjects of national isolationism and national identity politics,2016-10-27

142,looking beyond november th  a song of oligarchy and doom,link greetings ats community i wanted to pass on something my dad experienced several years ago in the hopes that perhaps others have experienced something similiar or know someone who has i found the story quite interesting and i hope you will too background my dad was a pilot with  years of experience flying all manner of civilian military and commercial aircraft he was a naturally humble and quiet individualnever given to boasting or exageration like many pilots he was wired to be logical mathematical and mechanical he was also a supreme skeptic where all things supernatural and speculative are concerned he preferred direct experience and scientific inquiry to wild tales his story one day he came back from a trip he flew commercial flight to mexico over a beer i casually asked him about his trip he looked at me cocked one eyebrow and replied i saw something i cant explain this got my attention on the layover he and another pilot went out for dinner walking back along the beach at night they both noticed a distant light moving along a fixed vector at a constant speed they kept watching it and were wondering about distance and elevation thinking perhaps it was either a satellite or a highflying aircraftnothing out of the ordinary then it came to a complete stop reversed direction  degrees and whizzed off so fast it was out of sight in less than a second or two so my first response was do you think it was a ufo again with the cocked eyebrow he said i dont want to use that word all i will say is that what we witnessed completely and utterly defies all laws of aerodynamics that im familiar with im not aware of any aircraftmilitary or otherwisethat can do that its beyond my abilities to explain thats all im willing to say to contrast this story i will also say that one time we were watching a campy early s fox program that was reporting on the us government harboring aliens at one point in the story they started talking about a particular installation in the mountains of nevada not area  thats being used as a landing zone for ufos dad started laughing so hard i thought he was going to fall off the couch he looked at me and said i know what they do there i said and he replied i cant tell you that but i can tell you theyre not landing ufos total buzz kill anyway thats the story i wanted to relate in the hopes that others can add their own thanks for reading,2016-10-27
143,more footage of operation high jump with hitler,the moon that fell from heaven page  link there is an intriguing text from anatolian myth with regards to the moon falling from heaven the moon god fell from the sky and fell upon the gate complex but no one saw him the storm god sent rain after him he sent rains after him fear seized him anxiety seized him the god hapantali went there he stood beside him and uttered over him the words of a spell the goddess kamrusepa looked down from the sky and said what in the world has happened here a good question from kamrusepa there then but the text is fragmentary and partial and the matter isnt really explained so anyway the first question then is were was this gate complex and why couldnt he the moon be seen having landed my consideration is that the gate complex is that of the cilician gates  and that the moon can no longer be seen as he has infused the taurus mountains with silver that region did relate to the silver mountains as several sources mention and was a major centre for the trade in silver at kultepekanes the essence of the trade was to ship tin woolen textiles and lapis lazuli to anatolia to sell it there in order to acquire directly or indirectly silver and gold which was shipped back to assur tin essential for the anatoian production of bronze was imported in assur from susa perhaps by elamite caravans and ultimately originated from central asia assyrian trade colony at kanes there are a great many tablets related to this trade recovered from kultepe on these sometimes can be seen the taurus bull that bears upon its back the silver mountain also seen beneath on that example is the scorpion which was likely also an ideogram based upon the cilician gates and greater region also the symbol of ishara the goddess of the silver mountain and related to concept idea of the moon within the underworld her symbolic metal silver and purity through refinement the temple of ishara being at kanes or nesi to the hurrians there were a great many ideas bound up within this symbolism then including in cosmological terms the entrance into the underworld being above taurus in gemini and its opposite point of emergence in scorpio according to the intersection point of the galactic and ecliptic planes were this gets interesting is that there is a hurrian myth that relates to a conflict in the primeval period named the song of silver involving their tutelary god tessub and his ongoing issues with kumarbi god of destiny among tessub the sun god of the sky sauska ninevehs queen and all the gods no one worships him although his power is greater than their power his word is greater than their words his wisdom is greater than their wisdom his battle and his gory are greater than theirs it is silver the fine of whom i sing wise men tod me the story of the fatherless boy it did not exist long ago silvers father had disappeared and they do not know his spendor heroic men ran to battle abundance did not exist and grain did not grow only hunger the songs of the kumarbi cycle can contain veiled allegory regarding ethnic disputes such as i outlined here with regards to byblos and ebla it is likely the same in this case conflict with the region of nesa and the silver mountains this however relating to a much earlier period potentially also this relates to conflict from the heavens as silver could be named kubbabaranzu as noted here the association with anzu in conflict with tessub relating to the same with ninurta in the sumerian mythos and that seemingly from anatolia the identification of silver as dumu also correlates with the sumerian notion of the divine child as damu often seen as the basis for the cult of dumuzid were it was also the case that the city of dumuzid badtivira was the centre of the sumerian metallurgy industry silver is described in this text as a wannumiyas dumu which means a child whose father is dead or missing hittitologists generally translate this as orphan silvers consternation at being told by the orphan boy that he too was an orphan need not mean that he was discovering this for the first time the song of silver again is fragmentary but does seem to involve silver at some point establishing his power silver seized power with his hands silver seized the spear he dragged the sun and moon down from heaven the sun and the moon did reverence they bowed to silver the sun and the moon began to speak to silver o silver our lord do not strikekill us we are the luminaries of heaven and earth we are the torches of what lands you govern if you strikekill us you will proceed to govern the dark lands personally his soul within him was filled with lovehe had pity on them in dragging the sun and the moon down from heaven again it could be considered that is what had infused the mountains with gold and silver but also it could relate to the establishment of the cults of allani and ishara at the time of silver the spiritual qualities brought down to earth hopefully in the future more complete accounts of these texts will emerge as they are most intriguing and almost completely overlooked apart from specialists in the field which is a pity as they are more interesting than most edit on kamvamericachicagothursday by kantzveldt because no reason given,2016-10-27

156,is google and youtube in the hillarys purse,scientists say weird signals from space are probably aliens a team of astronomers believes that strange signals emanating from a cluster of stars are actually aliens trying to tell the universe they exist the study which appeared in the publications of the astronomical society of the pacific analyzed the odd beams of light from  stars  a fraction of the  million that were observed the bizarre beacons led the papers authors ermanno f borra and eric trottier from laval university in quebec to conclude that its probably aliens we find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an extraterrestrial intelligence signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis wrote borra and trottier they also note that their findings align with the extraterrestrial intelligence eti hypothesis since the mysterious activity only occurred in a tiny fraction of stars the hypothesis also suggests that an intelligent life force would use a more sophisticated optical beacon than say radio waves to reveal its existence click link for article mods  if this is a duplicate please delete  and or lock  so apparently signals detected from  stars are fitting the hypothesized parameters established for extraterrestrial intelligence the stars in question also fit the hypothesized parameters for supporting life since only a small amount of stars in the area being looked at are fitting the parameters they are using that as further evidence in support of their claims thoughts,2016-10-28
157,media shame  these  journalists are now presstitutes their madam is hillary clinton,can normal transistors act like a qubit page  link hi i guess i have a question relating to quantum computing since qubits are what makes up quantum computers that being a qubits can act like a transistor that can be either on off or both on and off at the same time in usual computing transistors are either on or off in quantum they can be both on and off at the same time the question i have is simply this is it possible to make a transistor that can act as on off and on and off at the same time even if you had to add an extra layer of circuitry to get that same reading from that single transistor i mean a normal transistor operate that if it gets no voltage or low voltage then the transistor is in an off state if it gets a certain voltage it is in an on state couldnt you make the voltage extra high to get a both onoff at the same time state or half voltage to get the same onoff state at the same time to essentially create a fake qubit scenario there might have to be additional transistors to help make sure of that determination of a transistor appearing in an onoff state but couldnt it be possible perhaps a circuit of transistors could determine whether the proceeding transistor should act as both onoff by checking the voltage some how idk please answer me like im a drunk stupid idiot perhaps laymen terms i can be quite the idiot sometimes thanks for hearing me out im currently drunk and just pondering things link a reply to darage im sure we could do weird stuff with circuitry to store more than one bit of data in the circuit but that doesnt really give an advantage over just storing more bits with our conventional technology which has been highly refined the advantage of the qbit isnt really that it stores more information its that it can be used to process more information at the same time quantum  computing  quantum computing the key features of an ordinary computerbits registers logic gates algorithms and so onhave analogous features in a quantum computer instead of bits a quantum computer has quantum bits or qubits which work in a particularly intriguing way where a bit can store either a zero or a  a qubit can store a zero a one both zero and one or an infinite number of values in betweenand be in multiple states store multiple values at the same time if that sounds confusing think back to light being a particle and a wave at the same time schrödingers cat being alive and dead or a car being a bicycle and a bus a gentler way to think of the numbers qubits store is through the physics concept of superposition where two waves add to make a third one that contains both of the originals if you blow on something like a flute the pipe fills up with a standing wave a wave made up of a fundamental frequency the basic note youre playing and lots of overtones or harmonics higherfrequency multiples of the fundamental the wave inside the pipe contains all these waves simultaneously theyre added together to make a combined wave that includes them all qubits use superposition to represent multiple states multiple numeric values simultaneously in a similar way just as a quantum computer can store multiple numbers at once so it can process them simultaneously instead of working in serial doing a series of things one at a time in a sequence it can work in parallel doing multiple things at the same time only when you try to find out what state its actually in at any given moment by measuring it in other words does it collapse into one of its possible statesand that gives you the answer to your problem estimates suggest a quantum computers ability to work in parallel would make it millions of times faster than any conventional computer if only we could build it so how would we do that explainthatstuffcom if i understand correctly a quantum computer will just be a smaller more energy efficient version of a massive parallel computer,2016-10-28

in the midst of deepening tension between us allies nato and russia nato is planning the largest military buildup along the russian border since the cold war 
nato called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort according to reuters  thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks 
it was reported that italy france denmark and other european states are expected to join the nato military divisions that will be led by the united states along russias border 
on wednesday britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to russias borders as part of a huge military deployment 
a total of  troops drones and tanks are moving to estonia as part of the biggest military buildup of nato troops on russias borders since the cold war 
in addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation nato has an army of over  ready to be called up to fight at any time 
the us military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a deterrent to the russian military but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war 
this is a credible deterrence not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict nato secretarygeneral jens stoltenberg said on tuesday  ironically ignoring the fact that it is a de facto provocation 
just imagine what would happen if russian troops amassed along the mexican border and told the us that this move was to prevent conflict 
the socalled iskanderm cruise missiles can hit targets across poland and the baltics although nato officials declined to say if russia had moved nuclear warheads to kaliningrad 
the united states envoy to nato douglas lute told reporters that nato and the us military may consider russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of natos deployment this statement is insane considering the fact that the us military is the one that is many miles from home on the border of someone elses lands 
this deployment if it becomes permanent if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed would be a change in russias security posture lute said 
if anyone is a threat it is nato and the us government 
these military tensions are the result of an ongoing proxy war in syria in which western powers are attempting to institute a regime change in the country by funding violent rebel groups meanwhile russia has interests in keeping their allies in the syrian government in control putting the two superpowers at odds 
until now russia and the us have been fighting through third parties just as they had during the previous cold war and the same type of situation is developing today

173,things you need to know about the dakota access pipeline protests,"by tony cartalucci 
myanmars defacto leader aung san suu kyi of the national league for democracy ndl political party has paved her time since coming to power earlier this year with both irony and hypocrisy she has not only illegally declared herself leader of the southeast asian state in contravention of its constitution she has also embarked on an ironfisted purge of her political opponents identical to the one she fought against as she struggled to seize power to begin with 
during elections earlier this year myanmars constitution prevented suu kyi from holding the nations highest office due to her inordinate amount of time overseas her status of having been married to a foreign and her childrens dual citizenship instead of adhering to the law her party once in power simply contrived an entirely new post for her state counsellor of myanmar which makes her the defacto leader of myanmar 
canadas the globe and mail in an article titled stéphane dion says aung san suu kyi is the de facto leader of myanmar would note that canadas government recognized this legal sidestepping stating 
dion called suu kyi now myanmars foreign minister the de facto national leader of her country because they have a strange rule that if you have married somebody whos not of the country you cannot be the leader of the government and of the state 
suu kyi the internationally recognized democracy advocate is barred from becoming president because her late husband was british as are her two sons the rule was crafted during myanmars decades of military rule which suu kyi fought against during years of house arrest before finally prevailing last fall 
in essence she is unelected and illegally holding power for a woman whos western backers  particularly in the united states and united kingdom  have held her up as a champion for democracy and the rule of law she and her partys first act upon taking power was trampling both the inhumane humanitarian 
another myth built up around nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi by the west has been her advocacy for human rights her advocacy for human rights however appears only to extend out to protect only as far as her immediate political allies are concerned for groups beyond this selfserving political protection and particularly regarding her political opponents she and her ndl are just as eager to jail crush or kill political opponents as they claimed the ruling military government had been 
in addition to escalating violence targeting the nations rohingyas population several activists online have been sent to jail for insulting the ruling government and westernbacked media fronts and organizations 
myanmars eleven media group emg in its article facebook offender brought to court for insulting suu kyi attempted to distance what suu kyi and her political supporters had once called draconian censorship as now a simple matter of enforcing the law it would state 
a facebook user named zaw zaw aka nga pha was brought to the north dagon township court on october  to face prosecution for his defamatory posts about state counsellor aung san suu kyi 
he has been charged under section d of the telecommunications law 
hes being sued for defamatory writing and photos about the state counsellor posted on facebook said plaintiff nay myo kyaw a yearold resident of north okkalapa township 
around  people showed up at the hearing wearing shirts affiliated with a group called the network of supporters of the rule of law they shouted you deserved it for insulting a good person 
the article also admits 
the myawady township court sentenced aung win hlaing aka a nyar thar the first man to be prosecuted under the current government for defamatory posts on facebook about president htin kyaw to nine months in jail after he was convicted under section d of the telecommunications law 
aung myint tun aka ko pho htaung a member of the national league for democracy is still facing legal action under the same law for the wording of a resignation letter 
another man named yar pyay was arrested and is being prosecuted for creating a fake facebook account under the name of nay myo wai the chairman of peace and diversity party 
hla phone was also arrested and is being prosecuted for defamatory posts on facebook about the commanderinchief 
emg  ironically awarded for its work in opposing the previous militaryled government by reporters without borders  would also admit that it itself had taken advantage of myanmars laws to silence its own critics claiming 
eleven media group emg also filed complaints about repeated defamatory posts on facebook against the group though emg lodged complaints against film director mike tee who is the owner of a facebook account named than tun zaw and another facebook user named myat maw for offensive posts about the group and its staff the legal process has yet to begin emg lodged the complaints on january  and march  this year 
one would expect such a tidal wave of abuse  as defined by the west in regards to media governance and censorship around the world  to be met with sweeping condemnation from the wests various human rights advocacy organizations including human rights watch amnesty international and a no doubt embarrassed reporters without borders  yet the silence is as deafening as it is telling taking over where accused dictators left off 
the wests champions of democracy rule of law and human rights in myanmar appears to have simply taken over right where suu kyi and her ndl party had claimed the militaryled government left off and despite the overt nature of suu kyis breaches of western standards of democracy and human rights the us is on track to lift all sanctions from myanmar as suu kyi and her government open the nation its people and its resources to exploitation by western corporations 
the overt nature of both the wests and suu kyis hypocrisy illustrates that democracy rule of law and human rights are merely facades behind which the west and its proxies wield their power  hiding behind such principles rather than truly upholding them and in reality such behavior undermines these principles more than any overt abuse by an openly tyrannical regime ever could  because genuine advocates thus become associated with hypocrites like the western governments supporting the current regime in myanmar their fauxnongovernmental organizations aiding and abetting the regime and proxies like suu kyi and her ndl themselves 
international audiences must keep this example of hypocrisy in mind as the west attempts to overturn other governments in southeast asia and beyond under similar pretexts and using similar rhetoric  supporting supposed prodemocracy and prohuman rights advocates who have every intention of trampling both upon seizing power

i begin this piece with three quotes from my workinprogress the underground 
there is a media metaphysics its basic principle states that nothing exists until it becomes information now we have a new twist information only becomes real when it reaches a mind already attuned to it in other words the tree falling in the forest makes a sound only if a userconsumer who wants a tree to fall receives video and audio of the event 
information can be dressed up a thousand different ways but it tends to have an elastic quality by that i mean you eventually get to see the person who dressed it up thats a problem for chronic liars who inhabit the press they expose themselves even though they dont want to it takes a surprisingly small push to expose the whole operation this is happening now right in front of our eyes 
the basis of big media is theater news is theater its directors and producers think theyre doing a firstrate job but theyre sadly mistaken gaps and obfuscations are growing larger the outright nonsequiturs and gibberish are becoming more apparent the audience is wising up to the farce who are these fools who direct the news theyre simply people who want to sell their souls and have found an elite buyer but that transaction doesnt contain any guarantees about shelf life mainstream news is decaying and the expiration date is approaching like civilizations the petty princes of information rise and fall 
globalized media its nice plan lets examine it 
the new technocratic media is based on profiling users there is no impactful news unless each member of the audience is surveilled and analyzed on the basis of what he already likes and wants 
shocking its to be expected how else would technocrats parlay the untold hours theyve spent sizing up their consumersusers 
several years ago i wrote tech blather has already begun since jeff bezos ceo of amazon bought the washington post at a fire sale jeff genius will invent new ways to transmit the news to people on the go and make the post a smashing success mobile devices multiple platforms digital taking over from print ads customized to fit readers interests profiling news stories customized to fit readers interests more profiling 
in other words nonnews if you thought media were irrelevant and deceptive before you havent seen anything the new news will create millions of virtual bubbles in which profiled users can float contentedly under the cozy cottage roofs of their favorite little separate paradigms 
the tech giant apple has waded into this territory with an app that will deliver news to users yahoo apple news part of the upcoming ios  operating system aims to be the primary news source for users of the iphone and ipad apple says its news app follows over a million topics and pulls relevant stories based on your specific interests joshua benton of the nieman journalism lab said the app will be important because through the awesome power of default apple distribution puts it in an entirely other league this news app will be on hundreds of millions of devices within  hours of its debut 
translation profiling their users down to their toenails apple will present them with virtual bubbles of news they want to see and read 
not just one overall presentation for all no different news outlets for apples audiences 
this introduces a whole new layer of mind control 
youre an obama fan here are stories confirming your belief in the prophet 
you want neocon on the rocks with a conservative republican twist heres some war footage thatll warm your heart 
do you believe government gridlock is our biggest concern congress cant get anything done weve got headlines for that from here to the moon 
tuned into celeb gossip heres your world in three minutes 
the idea convince users one day at a time that what they already believe is important is the news of the day 
its decentralized centralization one media giant carving its global audience up into little pieces and delivering them a whole host of different algorithmically appropriate lies and fluff and nocontext psyops 
and for fringe users youre doubtful about gmos well look at what whole foods is planning for their healthier produce section cheer up nothing about maui voters declaring a temporary ban on devastatingly toxic monsantodow experiments or the dangers of roundup youre antivaccine sorry you dont count youre not a recognized demographic but heres a piece about a little unvaccinated boy who was involved in car crash on the i 
does this sound like science fiction it isnt its the mainstream look of the nearfuture search engines are already personalizing your inquiries us abc national news is climbing in the ratings because its giving viewers lighter stories and spending less time on thorny issues like the middle east 
the mainstream news business is desperately looking for audience and treating every user as a profiled socialconstructbundle of superficial preferences is their answer 
mr x weve studied the little virtual bubble you live in and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth 
hello audience were going to pitch you on becoming fullfledged obsessed consumers as if there is no other worthy goal in lifeand then were going to profile you from top to bottom to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands 
the onetwo punch 
any actual event occurring in the world will be predigested by robot media editors and profilers and then split up into variously programmed bits of information for different audiences 
who cares what really happened in the new world there is no what really happened thats a gross misnomer a faulty idea a metaphysical error no there is only a multiforked media tongue that simultaneously spits out a dozen or a hundred variations of the same eventbecause different viewers want and expect different realities

user a wow did you see the coverage of the border war in chula vista 
user b war they had a fantastic exhibit of drones down there at least a hundred different types and then i watched an old ww movie about aerial combat 
user c chula vista they had a great food show this woman made a lemon pie i could practically taste it 
user d that wasnt a border war it was a drill and then afterwards these cops gave a demonstration of all their gear vests shields communication devices flashbangs auto rifles with silencers batons i watch drills all over the country love them 
user e chula vista the only thing i saw on the news was sunny and mild this week i watch all the weather channels i love them 
but when a big one comes along like the  national election in the us the separate tunes come together and ring as one then the overriding need to extend globalisms goals in the person of hillary clinton blot out every other priority then the major media twist whatever they need to twist then its the same bubble for everyone 
one problem though major media have been lanced thousands of times by alt news sites and by wikileaks and project veritas this attack has exposed the truth and the clinton crimes 
and alt news reflects the growing interest of the public in whats actually happening on many fronts 
the technocratic plan for the news is failing 
it was a nice plan but 
its turning out to be a dud 
alt media are forcing public awareness of one giant scandal after another hillaryobama support for isis provaccine liars the collapse of obamacare the gmo hustle pesticide damageon and on and on 
the result major media are being backed into a corner where they must defend lies and build monolithic lies for everyone all the time the idea of creating separate news for each profiled user is collapsing 
major media are playing defense against the rest of the world 
its quite a party 
and it has no expiration date 
a final note trump wikileaks project veritas drudge and many alt news sites created a perfect storm in  raining down on major media it was and is unprecedented the mainstream press has been exposed down to its roots as never before the lying the collusion the arrogant sense of entitlement the desperation the corruptionits all there to see for anyone who has eyes and a few working brain cells expect more to come regardless of the outcome of the election the train has really left the station

part  of  
the following is the testimony i will present pro se without a lawyer representing me to the pennsylvania public utility commissions administrative law court november  and   as a result of my not permitting an ami smart meter to be retrofitted on to my electric service by peco an exelon company that provides electricity and service to the suburban philadelphia where i live 
this testimony addresses most of the health legal and constitutional issues plus the politics involved regarding the unsafe and rfemf cancercausing technology forced on consumers along with threats of no electric service if utility customers refuse an ami smart meter 
there are four parts to the entire testimony that was  pages long plus  pages of exhibits a thru w and other documentation i had in my brief case not presented but as backup if needed that totaled in excess of three to four hundred pages of scientific documentation published research etc 
personally i think after reading the entire testimony which will appear in four parts readers can understand whats involved with unsafe fireprone and rfemfdirty electricityproducing ami smart meters when for decades utilities provided safe nonplastic parts analog meters before the administrative law court at the pa public utility commission philadelphia pa  november     
your honor judge heep and judge pell members of the pa puc peco energy company the exelon legal team and all interested parties 
since today is the rescheduled postponed june   hearing and for which i catherine j frompovich submitted written testimony five days in advance of that previous hearing as per court rules i have decided to revise and include additional testimony interspersed into the previous  pages  pages of testimony and  pages of exhibits a thru q that i submitted via the us postal service and which all parties received i presume 
however in view of the paramount importance plus dire consequences of emfsrfs being forced onto pennsylvania consumers with no optout for personal safety and protection from  nonionizing radiation emitted by ami smart meters microwave technology and my being a fiveyear breast cancer survivor i submit into testimony and evidence that the pa puc and all participating pennsylvania utilities not just peco as in my case must factor in the american with disabilities act amendments which redefine cancer as a disability especially since there are cancercausing effects from emfsrfs about which i submit into the record hundreds of documented scientific evidence as dozens of exhibits per the schedule of exhibits i now introduce plus printed documents i have with me in support of the fourpage bibliography of pertinent published literature regarding electromagnetic radiation cancer  ami smart meters that i also submit into the record as exhibit s  
since the ada amendments act provides for three prongs of what constitutes a disability i am submitting into evidence a printout titled americans with disability act amendments act adaaa pointing out appropriate and applicable sections exhibit a  a twopage printout titled ada amendments redefine cancer as a disability exhibit a  along with a page dossier containing about  published studies regarding breast and other cancers and emfelfrf cancer studies exhibit a  and topping off those documents with a twopage letter dated  august  from the foremost emfrf researchers physicians and academics in the world written to the north carolina utilities commission exhibit a wherein in the third paragraph they state 
smart meters and cell phones occupy similar frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum meaning that cell phone research can apply to smart meter rfr smart meter rfr consists of frequent very intense but very brief pulses throughout the day because smart meter exposure over a  hour period can be very prolonged  pulses can average  times a day  and because there is building evidence that the sharp high intensity pulses are particularly harmful  the cell phone study findings are applicable when discussing adverse health impacts from smart meters 
those five researchers david carpenter md director institute for health and the environment university of albany dr lennart hardell md phd professor department of oncology university hospital orebro sweden dr magda havas bsc phd environmental  resources studies trent university canada dr martha herbert md phd assistant professor of neurology harvard medical school pediatric neurologist and neuroscientist at the massachusetts general hospital boston dr sam milham md mph former chief epidemiologist washington state department of health 
point out in the last sentence of the first paragraph  it is imperative that the north carolina utilities commission be fully aware of the harm that rfr can cause and allow utility customers to opt out of smart meter installation with no penalty 
frompovich respectfully points out and also cautions the pa puc that in not permitting opt outs from ami smart meters in pennsylvania during formulating its ami sm regulations since hb stated ami sms were not to be mandated  it has breached ethical and legal standards regarding unsafe ami sms regarding the rfrs they emit various states have permitted safe electric power usage by granting and implementing ami sms opt outs which the pa puc deliberately refused in formulating its utility regulations regarding ami sms thereby subjecting consumers to unknown adverse health effects which in essence violate the nuremberg code since consumers consent was not required nor asked and their use apparently amounts to an experiment on pecos customers 
again frompovich points to the letter addressed to the ncuc exhibit a at the end of the second paragraph wherein those researchers cite the us ntp june  study conclusion in part stating adds proof to the conclusions from the human health studies that radiofrequency radiation increases risk of cancer  
frompovich further elaborates that cell phone rfr exposure is elective  ie depending upon personal choice use and an individuals ability to turn off cell phones thereby reducing andor avoiding similar frequency microwave bands and rfrs exposures both cell phones and ami sms produce 
however harmful personal bodily rfr exposure has been mandated by pa puc regulationsnot hbact   and therefore is absolutely illegal since act  does not defy nor negate the pennsylvania state constitutions inherent rights of mankind section  but its the commonwealths regulatory agencythe pa pucthat is guilty of nonfulfillment i allege 
all men and women are born equally free and independent and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty of acquiring possessing and protecting property and reputation  and of pursuing their own happiness  pennsylvania constitution section  
however contrary to that pennsylvania constitutional right is the fact that mandated ami smart meter rfr exposure because of no opt outs in pennsylvania specifically via pa puc regulations not act  literally provides no way to escape andor avoid ami sms microwave rfrs that is illegal and should be prosecuted criminally frompovich contends furthermore the pa puc overstepped its agency powers and frompovich contends is guilty of committing ultra vires during its rulemaking process 
the above five researchers exhibit a delineate cell phone and smart meters as basically the same animal because both occupy similar frequency bands on the electromagnetic spectrum see paragraph  of their letter to the ncuc for more detail including that smart meters over a hour period can average  pulses a day causing high intensity pulses known as dirty electricity  
i submit into the record exhibit a dirty electricity or dirty power and the page report why are electromagnetic fields dangerous  is dirty electricity making you sick including  charts  table  ranking electric meters and table  ranking electric meters for risk of privacy and cyber security from the page report ranking electricity meters for risk to health privacy and cyber security available online at httpswwwscribdcomdocrankingelectricitymetersforrisktohealthprivacyandcybersecurity  
the key dispute and multifaceted issue of concern in frompovichs case  being a breast cancer survivor in excess of five years  is her free and legal exercise of legal and constitutional rights to be free of the fear exposure to cancercausing emfs andor actuality of contracting cancer due to ami sm rfr exposures  in her homesomething that the ada amendments act indisputably encompass since once a cancer patient that makes frompovich covered within one of the adaaa prongs for all time and also includes frompovichs indefeasible right to protect property both her home and her personal body and its life processes including her reputation 
that federal adaaa must be factored into frompovichs case since peco has obtained federal grant monies to implement its ami smart meters rollout and the law states that any business that accepts federal grant money is mandated to abide by the adaaa including state regulatory agencies like the pa puc 
frompovichs refusal of an ami sm plus her human and innate right to protect her health body and property are more than confirmed when those five researchers point out  the strongest evidence for hazards coming from rfr is cancer  there is a growing body of evidence that some people develop a condition called electrohypersensitivity ehs see paragraph  of the letter to ncuc exhibit a  
on page  paragraph  of that same letter the researchers further point out a dichotomy in science which is the very fact that independent research versus industry research studies are at coincidental if not predictable  variances as per the chart i raise up and submit into the record  a doublesided poster radiofrequency research does funding matter which shows two pie charts depicting those conflicting statistics 
nonindustry studies indicate  harmful effects with  no effects while industry studies indicate   harmful effects with  no effects statistically thats almost a wash as each just about cancels the other however theres a slight edge of  from nonindustry studies indicating harmful effects more interestingly though is that industry studies did find  harmful effects studiesalmost onethird of the studies and yet the industry concludes differently stating there are none that alone should be a red flag for them or anyone of scientific mind to investigate further and they did not which indicates some sort of collusion of not wanting to know or find out is that a crime of omission or collusion 
paragraph  on page  of that letter exhibit a cites the obvious crux of scientific and ethical issues regarding ami smart meters in pennsylvania in particular stating with a leading nc dhhs staff member admitting that he is not qualified to review the literature and the fact that he relied on industry representatives for assistance the dhhs conclusion is not surprising 
frompovich feels compelled to question how much of that microwave technology industry representative assistance occurred and still occurs with and from peco and the pa puc thereby illegally depriving frompovich and all pennsylvanians of their rights to protect their health and property along with the exercise of redress against what amounts to experimental ami smart meter science whose proponents wantonly do not recognize nonthermal adverse health effects from rfrs which have been known since  i introduce exhibit t electrosensitivity es and electromagnetic hypersensitivity ehs into the record to document that in    and  various health issues have been identified with emf nonthermal exposures 
your honors i respectfully ask the court to instruct peco to produce the experimental studies rather than epidemiological studies indicating no nonthermal effects from emfsrfs wheres the science 
arent pecos customers entitled to have that evidence 
frompovich also feels compelled to ask this court the following how much influence did the microwave industry contribute to pa state representative robert godshalls campaign coffers andor his preferred charities that apparently has enabled godshall as chair of the pa house consumer affairs committee to sit on opt out bills in the pa legislature for several legislative sessions including godshalls verbal proclamations to others that he will never bring opt out bills to the floor for a vote which obviously is an impeachable offence for depriving pennsylvanians of their right to redress government and government agency oppressions that enable utility companies to harass and bully customers about cutting off electric service if they refuse fireprone ami sms in pennsylvania 
heres what other us states have done regarding ami smart meters 
analog meters are definitively offered as the optout meter in four states arizona california maine and texas the nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the greatest customer acceptance which clearly is the analog 
three states offer the existing meter as the optout meter an existing meter might or might not be analog georgia hawaii and consumers energy in michigan 
three states let the utility decide florida maryland and nevada the nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the greatest customer acceptance which clearly is the analog 
four states or utilities definitively forbid analog optouts fountain in colorado dte in michigan central hudson valley in new york amr and port angeles in washington touted as the first place to ban smart metersnot much help you are required to have a digital meter on your home 
two statesdistricts require smart meters pennsylvania and washington dc

this is the continuation of the testimony i will present before the pennsylvania public utility commissions administrative law court november  and   
currently chairman representative godshall is allowing three more opt out bills to become sine die this session which should amount to an impeachable offense for denying consumers their inherent and indefeasible rights especially of redress to government and also according to the pennsylvania constitution i contend 
probably nothing encapsulates and explains the emfrfr controversy or conundrum if you may from a scientific viewpoint than the page report  europaem emf guideline  for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of emfrelated health problems and illnesses  which is a spanish language document and found online at httpslistasumessympaarcanunciosmsghtml this report cites  published scientific references which leaves frompovich to question why the pa pucand peco in particularare so daft in proffering that there is no updated science other than the s era safety thermal science regarding microwave electromagnetic energies based in ancient radar studies the microwave industry always trots out as proof of safety 
those safety studies originated in germany during world war ii are totally outmoded but remain the present federal communications commissions rules regarding safety of cell phones and ami smart meters it is now  how come s microwave technology science is being applied as the gold standard or scientific criterion to meters that will become the key intelligence gathering technology for the internet of things frompovich has to question the credibility factor of both peco and the pa puc for depending upon  science in todays technology world of  wheres the science later than the s please may i have those studies peco supplied to the pa puc 
frompovich therefore respectfully suggests that the pa puc study the aboveaforementioned european reports with medical and ehs health professionals who are qualified to explain the diagnostics and varied modalities discussed in order to issue updated regulations affecting ami smart meters and their continuous rfremf healthdamaging electromagnetics plus their fireandexplosionprone proclivities and occurrences which definitely was not the case for all the decades utilities used safe and efficient analog meters 
children are the most vulnerable to emf radiation and therefore i introduce exhibit u why children absorb more microwave radiation than adults the consequences and exhibit u american academy of pediatrics august   letter urging the food and drug administration commissioner the federal communications commission and others to advise the public about specific absorption rates sars regarding emfrf exposures 
also i want to apprise every one of the fact that electromagnetic sensitivity ehs is a growing problem and according to recently reported statistics in the peer reviewed journal ecopsychology professor pamela reed gibson states the following  of the usa population  of the swedish population  of the danish population and   of the german population are ehs compromised see exhibit v  however other sources claim that as much as  of the entire worlds population is affected 
just as chemical sensitivities were discredited and denied by medical doctors for yearsnow referred to as sick building syndrome or multiple chemical sensitivity mcsso too is ehs now being recognized by many including the world health organization i introduce exhibit w electrohypersensitivity a functional impairment due to an inaccessible environment printout available here httpsdocsgooglecomvieweravpidforumssrcidmdgxodkwotknjuotuodqwntybmtuntizmdamtqxntynzintcbtvrzdgfeounbuufkataumqebdji 
as exhibit x i introduce a study no one can refute a review on electromagnetic fields emfs and the reproductive system which outlines science the microwave industry peco and all utilities utilizing ami smart meters plus public utility commissions across the usa need to factor into the inevitable legal liability that they are assuming by committing crimes against humanity by exposing the population to unsafe microwave electromagnetics  from dirty electricity pulsed by ami sms onto home wiring and into private residences and all buildings retrofitted with ami smart meters 
before i include my previously submitted testimony i find it necessary to impress upon the court that it should not be frompovichs obligation to prove the medical consequences beyond a reasonable doubt especially in light of the ada amendments act as it applies to those receiving federal funding or even that the consequences of medical problems are more probable than not since the adaaa provides frompovich with disability rights and protections which peco and the pa puc must abide by 
furthermore it should be the indisputable duty of peco and all pennsylvania utility companies  but more specifically that of the pa public utility commissions stated mission for being  to provide safe and nonradiating innovations in utility technology and appliances with  certainty which ami smart meters fail on numerous levels especially with their proclivity for hot sockets fires and explosions emfrf constant emissions and dirty electricity pulses as frequent as  times a day 
no medicalscientific testing has proved ami smart meters emfs safety regarding nonthermal adverse health effects that i know of wheres the science 
therefore frompovich should not be forced to allow a provenfireprone ami smart meter electric service on her property that would radiate dirty electricity into her residence with high rfr pulses every fifteen seconds 
just to add more salt to the wound as they would say there are no assurances that monitoring is not part and parcel of the ami smart meter agenda and an integral surveillance device of the internet of things or that information will be shared with unknown third partiesfor whatever reasonsand for which frompovich does not approve nor give her permission to peco the pa puc or any government agencies or agents 
therefore frompovich feels her privacy as well as her home and personal physiology will be subjected to unlawful unconstitutional and unnecessary interventions at various levels and specifically without proper legal processes eg courtissued warrants in order to surveil her home that automatically will occur from the twoway zigbee radio transmitter system of ami sms and all smart appliances which are built to interact with the coming surveillance technology of the internet of things the times frompovich makes tea in the morning and shuts off her lights for the night are no ones business but her own 
ive been researching consumer health issues and whatsoever affects human health negatively  including technologies since the late s during my career i was considered an expert witness providing testimony before several states legislaturelegislative hearings on health issues for numerous years i was ahead of both the popular curve and the allopathic paradigm of medicine regarding the role of diet nutrition epigenetics and lifestyle issues in maintaining optimum health avoiding disease and regaining health utilizing holistic health principles 
i am in my  th year thank god since the early s when i almost lost my life due to unfortunate medical mistakes and had to remove myself from mainstream allopathic care in order to save my life ive been immersed in whats called the holistic lifestyle ive beaten the odds including being a breast cancer survivor using holistic healthcare modalities for the record  of us adults and  of us children used whats referred to as cam in  per nih statistics complementary and alternative medicinecam as its called is popular throughout the world while in the us there is the national center for complementary and integrative health at the national institutes of health 
however the allopathic paradigm considers it quite frankly a pain in its professional butt since cam has become the go to healthcare system when allopathy fails one 
therefore i expect that i probably will educate misinformed individuals on the negative health consequences of electromagnetic frequencies from microwave energy producing technologies like cell phones and towers wifi smart gadgets and in particular ami smart meters which are being bullyforced onto electric natural gas and municipal water utility customers most state legislators the media and the public are undeniably ignorant of the damage being done to their health fortunately i am not one of those people thus my refusing an ami smart meter on my house but first i think you ought to know some of my background im a wellinformed plus over  years published consumer health researcher advocateactivist journalist and author 
that i should be taken seriously i offer some of my professional background retired practicing natural nutritionist former registered lobbyist with the us congress for five years representing holistic healthcare issues executive director for the national coalition for alternatives in nutrition and healthcare canah for five years and as such presented fdasolicited expertise input regarding holistic health practices for its  ota report otah ntis pb unconventional cancer treatments  expert nutrition witness before a congressional subcommittee opposing food irradiation government relations specialist for a consortium of natural nutrition supplement makers before the us food and drug administration the first government relations specialist for the life extension foundation who set up lefs government relations department a published journalist author of numerous books regarding health and lifestyle issues with several books available on amazoncom and my  book eat to beat disease foods medicinal qualities 
additionally i wrote and produced two tv shows one called  turn off the violence  was nominated for a telly award that hourlong show was instrumental in securing the giraffe award given to persons who stick out their necks for the common good the recipient was george mason university staff member connie kirkland who founded a hour crisis center for rape victims and promoted oncampus nonviolence educational campaigns specifically relating to rape and domestic violence what ive shared is much less than half of my background more would take too much of your time however i feel compelled to ask how many people can match my qualifications to discuss consumer health issues 
furthermore i want to underscore upfront that if i were a habitual drug addict rather than an informed concerned healthconscious researcher and consumer being harassed for trying to protect and preserve my health i probably would be welcomed with open arms plus there would be all types of programs and subsidies available for help because i am opposing faulty and healthdamaging rfemf science plus vestedinterest snooping surveillance and customer data marketing agendas using ami smart meters i am harassed and even threatened with termination of electric service even though all my bills are paid in full that leaves me with no options but to dutifully invoke and defend my state and federal constitutional rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness isnt there something radically wrong with such a construct especially in the usa if i have to do that 
attorney ward smiths interrogatory requesting frompovichs cancer health records quite frankly leaves everyone with whom ive shared that fact totally aghast and amazed why because frompovichs medical records are her personal information protected under hippa and i must protect them furthermore since the puc administrative law court hearing is of public record frompovich does not want her personal medical records made public information during any level in these proceedings as that is her fundamental right 
i respectfully bring to this courts attention that my breast cancer and medical records are not the issue whats the issue problem and at stake not only for me but for all pennsylvanians is the total callous disregard by utility companiespeco included the pa puc and the commonwealth for health hazards safety and the wellbeing of all pennsylvanians especially those with health issues compromised immune systems disabilities and especially young growing childrenfetuses in particularwhom rfemf and dirty electricity produced by ami smart meters affect and impact negatively 
before presenting into the record additional reams of recent research with documentation and annotationsnot s vintage radar safety researchfor rfsemfs and microwave electromagnetic energies impacts upon cancer and health i feel it necessary to introduce something no one probably has thought about nor factored into the ami smart meter hidden costs continuum  and that is healthcare services and ancillary costs stemming from nonionizing radiation rfsemfs smart meters impact upon human tissue 
there are mounting underlying longterm adverse health effects accruing as we speak from pa pucpeco forced ami smart meter  rfemf electromagnetics pulses harmonics and dirty electricity specifically adverse nonthermal health effects impacting children and an ageing pa population which will generate dire fiscal consequences plus responsibilities upon penna medicaid health cost line items in each years operating budget for the commonwealth 
to cement that forewarning i offer the world health organizations statistic approximately  of reported cases of ehs electromagnetic hypersensitivity were considered severe which means specialized caregiving that however does not include cancerinduced health issues from rfsemfs what kind of budget shortfall will ami smart meters adverse health effects eventually generate for pas legislature and governor to haggle about when weve seen whats been going on recently to get a state budget passed has anyone thought about that very real problem

231,what can the mass checkin at standing rock tell us about online advocacy,"by whitney webb 
over the course of this years us presidential election which has been nothing if not bizarre some have repeatedly speculated that the election may not actually happen at all if an opportunely timed terrorist attack or other major event occurred at just the right moment leading to a suspension of the november election now these theories appear to have more credence as sources within us intelligence have contacted pat milton a cbs news senior investigative producer warning him that terrorist attacks in three us states are highly likely come this monday the day before the us election us intelligence has allegedly alerted joint terrorism task forces that al qaeda not isis could be planning attacks in new york texas and virginia no specific locations within those three states were mentioned 
us authorities are said to be taking the threat seriously though cbs news  sources stress that the threat is still being assessed and its credibility has yet to be confirmed according to cbs  counterterrorism officials were alerted to the threat out of an abundance of caution 
earlier this week there were also warnings that polling places could be seen as attractive targets for lone wolf attackers by individuals motivated by violent extremist ideologies sovereign citizen or other extremist activity this has led federal law enforcement to plan for several worstcase scenarios one fbi official told cbs  
the counterterrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and wellpostured to defend against attacks here in the united states the fbi working with our federal state and local counterparts shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety 
however whats interesting here is that the terror threat is coming from al qaeda as opposed to the islamic state in the syrian civil war the us has been actively helping al qaeda there grouping their syrian branch  the al nusra front  in with the moderate rebels they support therefore al qaedas ability to launch attacks within the us has been directly aided by us intelligence making this announcement incredibly suspect 
its also worth pointing out that al qaeda since its inception has been a product of the us intelligence community in the s they were essentially created by the us to fight the soviets in afghanistan ever since they have conveniently been used as the justification for an expansion of us wars abroad and the elimination of civil liberties domestically 
it is also interesting that the threat is al qaeda and not the islamic state the islamic state has been the terrorist bogeyman of recent years and their involvement in any threat real or imagined is useful justification for escalating us involvement in syria it seems highly likely that the islamic state was left out due to recent revelations from wikileaks showing that their funding comes from the very same entities that donate millions to the clinton foundation 
it is also worth noting that if a terrorist attack does come to pass it will be a big help for hillary hillary has been under siege in recent weeks due to wikileaks near constant releases of her campaign chairs emails but also due to the fbis mutiny which led them to reopen a probe into clintons use of a private email server any terror attack would give clinton the opportunity to gain political ground by promoting her aggressive foreign policy aims in syria and the rest of the middle east 
however as mentioned at the beginning of this article it is also possible that a terrorist attack on us soil would give president obama the authority to either postpone or outright cancel the election something he could not normally do except in the event of extraordinary circumstances unfortunately only time will tell which theory is correct compelling us to stay vigilant in the meantime

232,smart meter case testimony before the pennsylvania public utility commission what no one wants to acknowledge about emf damage part  of,"by joseph jankowski 
an organization which has the aim to separate the state of california from the union of the united states is set to hold a meeting at the state capitol in sacramento on wednesday november   the day after the presidential election 
the yes california independence campaign  which is based in san diego describes itself as a nonviolent campaign to establish the country of california using any and all legal and constitutional means to do so 
the group is currently trying to qualify a citizens initiative in  to get a referendum for secession on the ballot in  reports sf gate  they will be in sacramento in hopes to gather support for the states exit or the calexit as they call it 
in our view the united states of america represents so many things that conflict with californian values and our continued statehood means california will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment and to the detriment of our children reads yes california s official website 
the groups page reads on 
although charity is part of our culture when you consider that californias infrastructure is falling apart our public schools are ranked among the worst in the entire country we have the highest number of homeless persons living without shelter and other basic necessities poverty rates remain high income inequality continues to expand and we must often borrow money from the future to provide services for today now is not the time for charity however this independence referendum is about more than california subsidizing other states of this country it is about the right to selfdetermination and the concept of voluntary association both of which are supported by constitutional and international law
it is about california taking its place in the world standing as an equal among nations we believe in two fundamental truths  california exerts a positive influence on the rest of the world and  california could do more good as an independent country than it is able to do as a just a us state 
yes california s website lays out  different points covering topics the group believes will benefit from a california exit from the us including education peace and security debt and taxes and immigration 
one blog post on their page draws parallels with a calexit and the recent referendum known as brexit that passed in the uk in june which showed that most british people are ready for their country to leave the eu 
the push for secession is nothing new to california in  the mayor of port orford oregon gilbert gable proposed the idea to push the oregon counties of curry josephine jackson and klamath to join with the california counties of del norte siskiyou and modoc to form a new state later named jefferson 
modoc county of northern california voted in  to join neighboring siskiyou county in a push to secede from the state of california  
in  two counties in northern california petitioned for the right to form a st state of america which they also wanted to name jefferson

breaking leaked  memo from attorney kumiki gibson to clinton foundation chairman bruce lindsay gibson had been hired to do an independent assessment of the foundations practices 
below are key quotes from gibsons findings keep in mind that the clinton foundations very existence depends on it being legally certified as a nonprofit entity in compliance with laws governing nonprofits break those laws and its nonprofit status would be revoked and the whole operation would go down the drain 
gibson important responsibilities regarding corporate filings are delegated to the foundation cfo who appears to delegate them to an outside organization with very little oversight by the legal department as a result the foundation is not in compliance with the filings rules including in new york which requires the foundation to be certified to do business in the state apparently the clinton foundation was not legally registered as a nonprofit in new york 
gibson no matter what the leadership decides about the larger overarching question it must act immediately to bring the foundation into compliance with the law and standards that govern notforprofits and must create strong legal and hr offices so to prevent any lapses in the future 
gibson the foundation does not have a record retention policy and the procedures currently utilized in harlem headquarters may violate the law 
zero hedge writes furthermore and more troubling the gibson review pointed to a highranking but unnamed foundation executive who was being paid by president clinton the government and the foundation who allowed the foundation to host what may have been or may have been viewed as a political event apparently without official preapproval from the foundations legal department and without regard before the fact to the impact of that decision on the foundations tax exempt status 
this memo was written in  it would have taken then and it would now take about a month of investigation by new york state and us dept of justice officials to nail down the particulars and sink the clinton foundation 
that didnt happen then will it happen now not if the dept of justice has anything to say about it the clintons are protected 
but evidence of the foundation corruption is spreading like wildfire some fires are impossible to contain

conservatives claim that voter id is necessary to catch illegal voters but it turns out theyre the only ones creating fake ids to use on election day 
trump supporters are taking trumps call to monitor polling places so seriously that they are creating fake id badges in order to infiltrate polling locations across the country and intimidate voters by interrogating them confusing them and filming them  all of which are illegal 
but trumps deplorables are doing this in droves with the help of a rightwing group known as vote protectors 
the group which is affiliated with top trump ally roger stone is giving people the ability to intimidate voters on election day they are literally teaching them to create their own fake badge which is designed to give them access to voters both inside and outside the polling places where citizens cast their votes 
according to the huffington post  
stones group created an officiallooking id badge for its volunteers to wear and its volunteers planned to videotape voters and conduct fake exit polls efforts that election experts say risks intimidating and confusing voters or at least thats what the group was planning to do before the huffington post asked stone about it on tuesday the controversial trump ally long known for his bareknuckled political tactics said that key proposals on his groups websites were there without his knowledge and assured huffpost that he would operate within the confines of election law 
in fact after huffpo confronted stone with evidence that these kinds of tactics were being pursued by the website he acknowledged that vote protectors had a bad idea and ordered them taken down 
campaign legal center deputy director danielle lang called the tactics a clear voter intimidation scheme 
its inherently intimidating and an invasion of privacy she told huffpo in reference to the videotaping when thats being live streamed to the internet it amplifies the potentially intimidating aspect of it and violates a sense of security and privacy people have a right to enjoy at the polls objectively intimidating voters is unlawful no matter where you do it 
indeed but thats exactly what donald trump has been calling upon his supporters to do because he has repeatedly claimed that the election is rigged against him 
as it turns out hes right about the election being rigged only its conservatives who are trying to rig it in favor of trump 
earlier this week a wisconsin city clerk in green bay got caught trying to intentionally prevent college students from voting by arguing in an email to the wisconsin ethics commission that an extra polling place should not be opened near the university of wisconsingreen bay because she has merely heard that students lean democrat 
i was reading the statutes and read no site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party republican appointed clerk kris teske wrote 
uwgb is a polling location for students and residents on election day but i feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole i have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat i have spoken with our chief of staff and others at city hall and they agree that budget wise this isnt going to happen i would like to know your thoughts on this do i have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats 
so not only are trump supporters trying to rig the election with voter intimidation tactics using hypocritical methods they are using voter suppression tactics as well 
and that is likely going to cause a lot of election day chaos voters should be prepared to stand up for their right to vote no matter what trumps deplorables try to do to keep them from exercising it

one thing that has continuously dogged the donald trump for president campaign is the fact that racists antisemites xenophobes misogynists and various other bigots have stuck with the bombastic real estate mogul since he first launched his travesty of a campaign no matter how much trumps people try to say he doesnt want the support of such folks the candidate himself refuses to take the fact that there is anything about the campaign he has been running that attracts these people seriously so naturally when trumps campaign manager kellyanne conway sat down with an interview with cnns jake tapper on sunday  that particular issue came up again of course conway was not happy tapper began 
there are a lot of antisemites and racists and misogynists who support the trump candidacy 
conway immediately went on defense saying wow tapper went on to reference a man who was shouting jewsa at the press pen at a recent trump rally and directly asked conway if she would refer to such people as deplorable she responded 
yes i would wow i have to push back on some of the adjectives you just used to describe  i hope youve been to trump rallies and i hope that youve seen the tens of thousands i mean hes had over half a million people easily i think in excess of that these are usaloving americans 
tapper went on to say that no he isnt putting all trump supporters into that camp but went on to force conways hand on this one 
but without question people who are experts on hate groups say that there has been a comfort level that has been offered to people who are antisemitic that has been offered to people who are antisemitic and racists and on and on and these people are comfortable coming out in the open and supporting mr trump 
mr trump has refused to condemn in a very serious way his racist and antisemitic fans tapper continued he just has he says things like oh sure i disavow i disavow but he has never serious said i dont want the support of those people they are reprehensible they have nothing to do with me he has never seriously done it 
conway used the pushing to pivot back to the idea that the trump campaign is winning saying 
i think this exchange is frankly the best piece of evidence i have that were actually going to win in nine days because the idea that were going to shift away from the pattern of corruption the cloud of ethical stain that hillary clinton would bring to the oval office in such an important week 
no kellyanne its not a sign that trump is winning its pointing something out that has been true since this whole fiasco began that donald trump is a raging bigot and he has been so openly dog whistles have turned into fog horns this election cycle and its all because of donald trump he embraces these bigots because hes one of them the quicker you learn that the better

for months since the former secretary of state launched her presidential bid her campaign logo has always symbolized americas quest to move forward with the arrow in the logo pointing to the right lefthanded people of course dispute that symbolism because for them moving forward should be pointing to the left 
but there is another school of thought about hillarys logo many believe that the arrow pointing right actually symbolizes moving to the conservative right as opposed to the liberal left 
the logo was a brilliant concept designed to help the democrats win over republican voters in the general elections  voters who will definitely choose a rightist over a leftist candidate

by now the term altright alternative right has become a familiar phrase especially on social media 
the alternative right commonly known as the altright is a set of farright ideologies groups and individuals whose core belief is that white identity is under attack by multicultural forces using political correctness and social justice to undermine white people and their civilization characterized by heavy use of social media and online memes altrighters eschew establishment conservatism skew young and embrace white ethnonationalism as a fundamental value 
in keeping up with this new political atmosphere apple has just announced that it will be replacing all keyboards on its desktops laptops iphones and ipads with a new design that adds the altright key the key will be located in the lowermost right corner of the keyboard how appropriate

in last issue of black agenda report i argued that readers should vote for the green party this november this week i will outline what to expect from a hillary clinton presidency the great migration of republicans into the democratic party tent of hillary clinton has guaranteed her victory in the highly undemocratic us presidential elections corporate media outlets have collaborated with clinton to instill deep popular fear of a trump administration fear of trump has been used to distract the many millions of people in the us who are fed up with both corporate parties this has led to a lack of investigation and analysis of what can be expected once hillary clinton actually takes office
the corporate media has exploited the general populations distaste for sexism and white supremacy in the process trump has made heinous statement after heinous statement all of which should be taken seriously by anyone who calls themselves a movement activist it is critical that the left in the us extend solidarity to those who experience the consequences of racism and sexism every day however trumps vile character has been used as a means to legitimize the candidacy of hillary clinton his characterization as a fascist has convinced many that his rule would be a greater danger to humanity than a clinton presidency
one could endlessly debate clinton supporters on the validity of such a claim trumps vulgar and putrid presentation has provided clinton supporters with a convenient weapon of defense against all criticism of their own vile choice yet the lesser evil argument has never been weaker than in the  elections it is reasonable to assume that a hillary clinton presidency will be far less effective than obama in effecting capitalist and imperialist hegemony this is why her support system the entire ruling class has gone into overdrive to spread fear of a russiatrump collaborative threat in every sphere of us political life
here are ten things to expect from a clinton presidency i will leave it to readers to judge as to whether clinton represents a lesser evil than trump or just plain evil
 the privatization of social security  hillary clinton has stated publicly and privately to her wall street friends that she will reignite conversations to downsize the program wikileaks exposed clintons support for the obamas administrations deficit reduction commission that originally proposed cuts to entitlements such as social security and medicare in  clinton donors on wall street have made it clear that they would love to get a hold of social security earnings and turn them into a financial market to be traded for profit
more hillary clinton must be indicted how hillary clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital voting for the lesser evil john pilger clinton policies will bring great aggression to the us and the world  world war iii  hillary clinton has stated in nearly every debate that her administration would consider placing a nofly zone in syria that means us airstrikes would rain down on syrian and russian assets in syria such a move would place the us military in direct confrontation with the russia clinton has been caught stating that the syrian and russian lives that will die in such a conflict are well worth the benefits
 the transpacific partnership  often called nafta on steroids the massive corporate trade agreement that captures much of asia pacific region has been a major talking point in the  elections clinton has supported the agreement in the past only to switch her position due to pressure from the bernie sanders campaign with sanders firmly in the clinton camp there is currently nothing in the way to stop clinton from moving forward with the tpps passage and making her private position on the deal a public reality
 maintenance and expansion of the surveillance state  not much needs to be said here the obama administrations vast expansion of the surveillance state has been exposed by the likes of ed snowden and julian assange wikileaks additionally revealed clintons desire to drone julian assange for releasing washingtons secrets to the public a clinton presidency has every intention of following up on the obama administrations passage of bills such as the national defense authorization act of  this bill gave the us government the right to militarily detain terror suspects indefinitely
 trumps wall  hillary clinton was obamas secretary of state from  over this time she helped facilitate the largest deportation of undocumented people in us history furthermore she oversaw the detention of thousands of central american children during the great migration from the  fascist coup in honduras a coup that was drawn up by clinton herself the usmexico border is more militarized than it has ever been trumps wall rhetoric was indeed a racist trip but too few recognize that something just as dangerous actually exists under current us immigration policy
 servitude to the bankers  hillary clinton has received over forty million in support from hedge funds in the  elections before selling out bernie sanders made it a point to request public access into clintons private quarter million dollar speeches to banks like goldman sachs the deregulation of the banks with the passage of the glasssteagall act was a clinton project both her current list of donors and past connection to her husbands policies make her the obvious choice for the finance capitalist class
 maintenance of the mass black incarceration state  hillary clinton is the enemy of black america from her callous use of the term super predator to describe working class black men to being the architect of the  crime bill the clinton dynasty virtually built the mass black incarceration state under bill and hillary clintons two terms the prison population rose by  this was facilitated by draconian three strikes laws mandatory drug sentence and the deep militarization of local police departments with her record it isnt too difficult to assume what another four years of clinton rule will bring in the realm of policing and prisons
 austerity and more austerity  it was the first clinton administration that eliminated welfare as we know it the evisceration of aid to families and dependent children afdc and its replacement temporary assistance to needy families tanf threw millions of women and children into poverty obama has followed up with draconian cuts to snap foodstamps there is nothing on clintons track record that indicates her administration would do anything but roll back whatever social programs and protections still exist for the poor in the us
 a boost to the privatization of education  hillary clinton received boos in july when she urged teachers unions and charter operators to work together for the greater good of students ever since clinton has attempted to exploit the rise of sanders by courting teachers unions to endorse her her position has slightly softened on the privatization of education but that hardly matters clinton receives broad support from school privatizers like walmart and should not be expected to roll back the shock and awe war on public education waged by the obama administration
 an economic crisis  bankers and economists have been predicting an economic crash for much of  capitalists everywhere were given free rein to recover with trillions in stimulus cash after sending the entire global capitalist economy into collapse in  the internal contradictions of the system are only sharpening as workers become poorer and global production stagnates whether clinton can manage a crisis in service of the capitalists as well obama has remains to be seen
clinton may very well be the highest expression of ruling class consensus that has ever presented itself in an election season her political record represents a greater material threat to humanity than donald trump for the sheer fact that she is the preferred candidate of the ruling class the question now is whether mass sentiment exists to organize around an alternative to the twoparty corporate duopoly jill stein and ajamu baraka are attempting to build the base of the green party ticket whatever method is chosen it must be wielded to combat lesser evil politics and build an organized force ready to struggle against the intensified suffering that will surely be imposed on the world by a clinton administration",2016-10-26

as donald trump gains more bad press hilary clinton rides the political wave with quick responses deflections and denials without question and largely due to trumps obnoxious candor and grandiose proclamations she is working her way back into the favor of disgruntled democrats and even right wing firebrands like the notorious glenn beck she is without question a wolf in sheeps clothing while trump is unbelievably hard to take constantly we need to focus on one simple question which of these candidates will lead to world devastation first
i suspect it would be hillary clinton who would be most inclined toward involving americans in another military conflict and she doesnt go small as she constantly demonizes russia with threats of military action in clintons own words youve seen reports russia has hacked into a lot of things china has hacked into a lot of things russia even hacked into the democratic national committee maybe even some state election systems so weve got to step up our game make sure we are well defended and can take the fight to those who go after us as president i will make it clear that the united states will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack we will be ready with serious political economic and military responses
military responses to a nation the us stood on the verge of war with for more than four decades military response against russia over suspected hacking hillary clinton betrayed her real mindset once and for all during the recent debate with donald trump when she spoke those words of war that would surely lead to only disastrous consequences
it all stems from the wikileaks release that included  emails and  attachments from leaders at the democratic national committee clinton says the russians did it the national mainstream media parroted those words its the american medias political conditioning system at its finest convincingly reaching tens of millions of americans and yet nobody knows if the blame is properly attributed to the russians in a usa today article from july  elizabith weise wrote computer security researchers say its difficult to definitively say the cyber theft of files from the democratic national committee subsequently posted online by wikileaks was the work of russian hackers as some media outlets have reported
russias leader vladmir putin says the us long ago tipped the scales in the wrong direction well before the cold war even ended peace with russia should be a top priority for any us presidential candidate the truth is that american politicians perpetually convinced they are making the right political moves created a road block on the highway to peace during the vietnam war putin said during the st petersburg international economic forum  it is not in my nature to scold someone  but when the united states unilaterally withdrew from the abm treaty in  they delivered a colossal blow to the entire system of international security that was the first blow when it comes to assessing the strategic balance of power in the world
more  things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency hillary clinton must be indicted how hillary clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital voting for the lesser evil now we have clinton warmongering over unfounded allegations
world rivals in the air
there is a decadesold history of rivalry between eastern and western jet fighter design and technology while american designs are more expensive and generally considered to be better the fastest jet fighter ever made is the russian mig it can break mach iii more than three times the speed of sound such demands lessen the life of an aircraft the mig is typically not flown at anything close to that speed as an interceptor however it was supreme no allied fighter in the sky could outrun it
the korean war was the first test soviet migs initially dominated the skies with russian and chinese pilots often at the controls the migs were deadly
on  november  at least sixteen american f fighters p mustangs were shot at by six soviet mig interceptors led by soviet wwii ace mayor nikolay v stroykov the wwii prop planes like the mustang along with the us f shooting star and f thunderjet jet fighters had a job on their hands fighting the robust and highly maneuverable mig fighters
everything changed when the us air force launched the f sabre wikipedia explains that the f sabre pilots enjoyed advantages they learned to exploit to the fullest foremost among those was a radar ranging gun sight on their six  caliber machine guns which ensured that even short bursts of fire generally found their target f pilots were also equipped with gsuits which prevented pilot blackout in highspeed turning maneuvers
it is unlikely that anybody will ever fully agree on the casualties and kill ratios over mig alley during the korean war
the soviets claimed  united nations planes of all types shot down including about  sabres the usaf only admits to losing less than  aircraft in air combat
the f pilots claimed  migs shot down while b gunners claimed a further  these numbers were later reduced to  migs the chinese air force claimed only  kills
in vietnam the competitors varied the mig and mig fighters were widely used by the north vietnamese air force they fought planes like the f super sabre f tiger and the f phantom once again if you believe western sources which are fairly reliable for the most part the us planes dominated in most air to air combat though the other side had plenty of talented pilots and more aces overall than the americans during the end of the cold war in the s the soviet mig was the terror of the skies there was more speculation about it than real knowledge at first while mig aircraft were only built in odd numbers the movie top gun references the aircraft by calling them migs  migs no ones been this close before the planes used in the movie were actually american f tigers painted black with red stars applied to the tails today the united states spends obscene amounts on planes like the f raptor and these aircraft do not have any clear advantages over modern russian planes like the su both in this case are capable of thrust vectoring which means the pilot can change the direction of the jet blast and create an entirely separate way to control the jet in flight the ultimate western jet in the world of thrust vectoring is the avb harrier which can actually take off and land like a helicopter hopefully the world will not have to put these machines against each other in a future war but with clinton at the helm it is entirely possible and the advantages the us used to hold over the russian military have evaporated into thin air
russias modern approach to warfare
during the decadeslong cold war the soviet union operated under archaic rules that essentially prevented a commander or a pilot from knowing their mission until they were dispatched to carry out the order kemp freund a us army sergeant major that i met while i was covering the war in afghanistan was quote d in my  video report camp joyce remote fire base near afghanistanpakistan border saying were trying to break the old soviet methods that they use and the soviet method had that lt col completely in the dark until he needed to move he added were still working with the higher echelons to get that to move downhill the soviet ways were detrimental and offered little freedom to a trained soldier or pilot but all that is over now todays russian pilots not only fly superior aircraft that cost far less than us taxpayer funded military planes they also utilize tactics of western pilots hillary clinton surely knows these facts but she wants to play with fire and be another war president which was so important to former president george w bush and obama too for that matter
other looming conflicts
lest we forget hillary clintons unwavering support of israel the apartheid religious nuclear state that has long been protected by us taxpayer money and military hardware the government of right wing israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu continues to violate the human rights of palestinians constantly while building settlements which are completely illegal under international law then there are the attacks in gaza that target schools and hospitals leaving hundreds and hundreds dead and thousands severely injured never does clinton speak out against the barbaric treatment israel reserves for nonjews never does she refer to the fact that the country we now call iran hasnt attacked a nation outside of its borders for more than three hundred years yet iran has been savagely attacked by the united states both directly and indirectly maintaining her warmongering spirit clinton said i want the iranians to know that if im president we will attack iran she added that we would be able to totally obliterate them",2016-10-27

the anarchist political observer noam chomsky has over the years espoused a strategy of voting for the democrat in swing states recently chomsky with john halle propounded  an eight point brief for lev lesser evil voting 
chomsky questions the ethicalmoral principle rejecting lev since lesser evil voting is designed to minimize evil as futile as lesser evilism is it is also futile to discuss there being a lesser evilism between the two utterly dominant rightist political parties in the united states lev in fact is an equally contemptible or greater evil
chomsky though sensibly cautions that challenges to the politicalbusiness duopoly needs to be contemplated with a full awareness of their possible consequences what are the possible consequences chomsky suggests a trump presidency should it materialize will undermine the burgeoning movement centered around the sanders campaign particularly if it is perceived as having minimized the dangers posed by the far right however another consequence is equally possible a horrendous slide to the right would spur progressives to coalesce among a leftist democrat andor it might finally cause former or potential democrats to reject the chicanery of the businessdominated democrats and embrace the progressivist platform of the green party
this costbenefit strategic accounting seriously pushes for progressivist change
focusing on the electoral system however must not be the endall and beall for bringing about progressivism in the us grassroots organizing and activism must continue to inform oppose poverty and impoverishment oppose war and violence and push for human rights and equal opportunity for all people  during electoral periods and between election cycles

 voting should not be viewed as a form of personal selfexpression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites
no argument with this
 the exclusive consequence of the act of voting in  will be if in a contested swing state to marginally increase or decrease the chance of one of the major party candidates winning
this is true of the individual act of voting the individual in solitude has little sway over the electoral result that is an obvious given however when a consciousness sweeps across a multitude of likeminded individuals then enormous potentials emerge this desire for a change from the effete status quo is arguably what occurred with the almost breakthrough candidacy of bernie saunders and it is also what happened in a dissimilar manner with the candidacy of donald trump chomsky has framed the exclusive consequence of the act of voting as the result of an individualistic action and it is but individuals can and do at times form a wider consciousness measurable by statistically rigorous polling results that has potential ramifications on a much greater scale that mere margins an example of this would be the expression of voter disgust in the canadian federal election of  following two successive majority governments led by the brian mulroney tories a voting tsunami washed away all but two tory seats in the seat parliament the conservatives had been around since  but the electoral demolition led to the eventual dissolution of the tories
 one of these candidates trump denies the existence of global warming calls for increasing use of fossil fuels dismantling of environmental regulations and refuses assistance to india and other developing nations as called for in the paris agreement the combination of which could in four years take us to a catastrophic tipping point trump has also pledged to deport  million mexican immigrants offered to provide for the defense of supporters who have assaulted african american protestors at his rallies stated his openness to using nuclear weapons supports a ban on muslims entering the us and regards the police in this country as absolutely mistreated and misunderstood while having done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order trump has also pledged to increase military spending while cutting taxes on the rich hence shredding what remains of the social welfare safety net despite pretenses
much of what trump stands for is anathema true there is no need to defend this man however trump stakes out important positions diametrical to hillary clinton for example clintons advocacy of a nofly zone over syria her saber rattling with russia her corporatefriendly policy toward socalled free trade deals
chomsky cleverly anticipated such an objection writing
 with respect to point  which some will challenge by citing the claim that clintons foreign policy could pose a more serious menace than that of trump
in any case while conceding as an outside possibility that trumps foreign policy is preferable most of us not already convinced that that is so will need more evidence than can be aired in a discussion involving this statement furthermore insofar as this is the fact of the matter following the logic through seems to require a vote for trump though its a bit hard to know whether those making this suggestion are intending it seriously
first chomsky concedes an outside possibility that trumps foreign policy is preferable in other words chomsky posits an inside possibility one assumes that chomsky is saying that there is the strongest likelihood that clintons foreign policy is preferable without any substantiation of why this would be so second he raises an unreasonable demand for evidence that trump will follow a less menacing foreign policy than clinton given that trump has never held political office no such evidence exists what does exist is plenty of evidence that clinton will pursue a menacing foreign policy there is no reason to assume clinton would reduce the number of american military bases overseas or curtail military spending in fact it is likelier that she would increase military spending she will also likeliest resort to a us military attack to bring about regime change in syria pushing the us closer to military confrontation with russia trumps detractors compare his bombastic rhetoric unfavorably to clintons rhetoric but toward putin or assad clintons undiplomatic utterances are on record
moreover following chomskys logic while the more preferable policies of trump lack evidence by the same token the more objectionable policies of trump also lack evidence for the same reason trump has no political track record upon which to judge what he would do if in the oval office thus following this chomskyian logic one could not pass judgement on hardly of trumps pronouncements would he really build a wall on the mexicous border where is the evidence for this would trump really ban muslims from entering the us where is the evidence for this
by effectively undermining trumps peacemongering visàvis clintons warmongering chomsky by the same logic undermines criticisms of the regressivist political utterances by trump thus following chomskys logic through it seems a bit hard to know whether his suggestion is intended seriously
 the suffering which these and other similarly extremist policies and attitudes will impose on marginalized and already oppressed populations has a high probability of being significantly greater than that which will result from a clinton presidency
one assumes that chomsky refers to the domestic population here trumps policies  if he is true to his word to protect jobs for american workers and punish offshoring of american jobs along with his opposition to the tpp  would be a political reversal for neoliberalization clintonomics would be decidedly worse for marginalized and oppressed peoples at home and abroad the economic plight of students the poor and ill however would be much better under a jill stein presidency 
the economic plight of students the poor and ill would be much better under a jill stein presidency
if chomsky is referring to the preponderant violence of us foreign policy and its oppressive and genocidal on populations then i agree with his basic moral principle not only must we take responsibility for our actions but the consequences of our actions for others are a far more important consideration than feeling good about ourselves under the democratic administration hundreds of thousands have died millions of people have been displaced and terrorist organizations have proliferated this is the evidence from clintons time in political office thus a vote for clinton is predictably a vote that will lead to a continuation perhaps even a ramping up of the suffering of others basic morality suggests to this writer to steer clear of casting such an oppressionenabling vote
 should constitute sufficient basis to voting for clinton where a vote is potentially consequentialnamely in a contested swing state
i contend that chomskys basis for  is false or questionable first chomsky has staunchly argued that we should concentrate foremost on the wrongful actions and crimes of our own state because they are something we can have an influence over but it seems that chomsky believes that trump will supersede clintons record of killing in iraq libya and syria clinton is not going to close us military abroad trump has called these bases into question and if one concentrates on the domestic population at least the rhetoric of trump against socalled free trade agreements and offshoring us factories abroad bodes well for the american worker
 however the left should also recognize that should trump win based on its failure to support clinton it will repeatedly face the accusation based in fact that it lacks concern for those sure to be most victimized by a trump administration
this criticism is antidemocratic furthermore the criticism applies conversely chomskys citing the accusation gives it a veneer of credence effectively it leads to the perpetuation of the businessparty duopoly the records of the bill clinton and barack obama administrations demonstrate the futility of such a proffered rationale clinton deregulated the finance sector exposed american workers to the vagaries of free trade implemented regressive welfare policies and continued aggressive us militarism abroad obama bailing out the banks attempts to cut back social security warring in afghanistan libya yemen and syria drone strikes confrontation with russia and china tpp and the lingering incarceration at guantanamo bay it is important to note that democrats arguably have a freer hand to implement rightist policy than republicans have since many supporters of democrats will mute their opposition to avoid providing succor to the republicans george bush was stymied from tinkering with social security notably obama has done an aboutface on social security and proposed an expansion picking up on the popularity for such a measure from the bernie saunders candidacy
 often this charge will emanate from establishment operatives who will use it as a bad faith justification for defeating challenges to corporate hegemony either in the democratic party or outside of it they will ensure that it will be widely circulated in mainstream media channels with the result that many of those who would otherwise be sympathetic to a left challenge will find it a convincing reason to maintain their ties with the political establishment rather than breaking with it as they must
it is true that establishment operatives will use lev as a bad faith justification for defeating challenges to corporate hegemony either in the democratic party or outside of it that was the case when ralph nader ran it is the case when cynthia mckinney ran and it is when jill stein runs the corporate media and even many socalled progressives will trot out this timeworn argument with each election cycle as long as enough people buy into the premise then the status quo will persist the result is that a rightwing government always assumes office in washington this bodes ill for the poor and working class it bodes poorly for nation states designated as enemy states by the us
 conclusion by dismissing a lesser evil electoral logic and thereby increasing the potential for clintons defeat the left will undermine what should be at the core of what it claims to be attempting to achieve
conclusion by buying into a lesser evil electoral logic the corporatepolitical duopoly will remain in power to continue policies that primarily benefit the  and their goals for further enrichment to unfetter finance to pursue a belligerent foreign policy  a policy that seeks to placate the militaryindustrial establishment and to further entrench corporate domination of the electoral system all of this is at crosshairs with what should be at the core of what progressives claim to be attempting to achieve
final comments
the tragedy of opting for lesser evilism is that the people get evil
some leftist commentators argue that there is no evilism  i found that to be preposterous barack obama was the socalled lesser evil the previous two election cycles obama is not a lesser evilist he is the man who enables evil  the cycles of usbacked violence and killing in places such as gaza syria bahrain afghanistan yemen and somalia underscore the utter futility of pandering to a perceived lesser evilism if one votes for a degree of evil then one should not be surprised when evil results
progressivism demands that social justice activists repudiate evil morality dictates that people should not live in fear of being killed a genuine peacemongering us president is needed to stop the killing and save lives consequently both democrats and republicans are anathema given the present candidates if people vote then the only conscionable vote is for someone not of the business party factions
only a propeace third party will set the us on a new path  outside of a revolution the election of a propeace third party is the only moral direction on the horizon for americans truly interested in steering their country toward peace and rehabilitating the ensanguined us reputation such a third party vote however may well augur the birth of a revolution on many promising fronts",2016-10-28

according to the syrian dissidents news website enab muhaysini has released a video recently in which he appreciated riyadh and other arab states for equipping his comrades with missiles
the saudi preacher said that the missiles that they have sent would be used to break the syrian army and its allies siege of aleppo
he also thanked turkey for supporting the terrorists and treating the wounded militants in its hospitals
jaish alfatah is a conglomerate of terrorist groups with alnusra fatah alsham front comprising its main body
in relevant remarks in june a source said that saudi arabia has sent new cargoes of weapons and financial aid to the terrorists in aleppo in northern syria to strengthen them against the syrian army and its allies fresh attacks
more why do we only hear of the humanitarian crisis in aleppo and not everywhere else in syria is maintaining assad the least worst option the criminal wests state sponsorship of terrorism israel wants syria destroyed as presaged by the oded yinon plan the saudi regime has recently sent small arms and new equipment including  drones to the terrorists in syria the source said
to this end riyadh has sent one of its ranking officers to the regions controlled by terrorists in northern aleppo to supply them with money and arms to intensify attacks and open new fronts against the syrian army and popular forces the source added
also a prominent syrian military analyst said earlier this month that the terrorists in aleppo take orders from outside and dont dare to leave the city in anticipation of punishment by saudi arabia and turkey
violation of the ceasefire by the terrorists and their opposition to the evacuation of aleppo is of no surprise as they are not the ones in charge of the decisionmaking for remaining or leaving the city rather they take orders from the regional and international sides for whom they are working turki hassan told fna last saturday
noting that the main cause of the terrorists stubborn stay in aleppo is that leaders of fatah alsham formerly known as alnusra front and ahrar alsham are afraid of punishment by their qatari saudi and turkish masters he said if they move in defiance of their qatari saudi and turkish lords they might be killed and their properties be seized",2016-10-29

isis wants any operation that could result in the highest number of victims said interior ministry spokesman major general mansour alturki
a security official general bassam attiyah said a vehicle carrying around  kilograms of explosives was found near the stadium he added that the suspects had planned to either target people in the stadiums parking lot or fans watching the match
another equally horrifying scenario would have occurred he added had the device exploded whilst the spectators were exiting the stadium
he noted that the blast radius would have been something around  meters which would have covered an area of almost  square meters

there are only weeks left until we find out if we have a president trump or a president clinton donald trump is perceived as the candidate who is against the corrupt establishment while hillary clinton is seen as part and fabric of the establishment and as the most corrupt candidate to run for president in the history of the country
a president clinton in a few weeks would return us to the hostile climate towards india that we saw in the s overseen by her husband after he took office in  the us relationship with india went on a considerable downslide for nearly a year clinton did not bother appointing an ambassador to india even as he went about opposing india on multiple fronts leading to anger in the indian establishment initially he was intent on disarming and weakening india by preventing access to technology and also mounted a sustained attack on the indian economy by imposing several economic sanctions
in  senator joe biden who is now the vice president under barack obama introduced an amendment in the bill granting aid to russia making the aid conditional on the fact that russia could not sell cryogenic engines for indias space programme the clinton administration was hellbent on hurting the development of indias space and technology sectors and blocked the sale of cray supercomputers that had been approved under the ronald reagan administration india was also targeted for several economic sanctions and was threatened under what was called the super  clause of the american trade law
these economic sanctions were specifically borne out in the way mr clinton attacked the indian textile and carpet industries throughout the s the terms dunkel draft super  wto and patent laws became synonyms for the us attempts to retard the indian economy and led to many protests in india
by  india was justified in believing that indous relations had hit the lowest point but things took a dramatic turn for the worse during bill clintons second term in office madeleine albright became the new secretary of state and she was increasingly hostile to india especially through her pseudoracist television outbursts in fact she loved attacking india so much she went at it after leaving office and called for a plebiscite in kashmir justifying the actions of violent groups in the process
more clintons policies look like a death sentence for americans  things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency hillary clinton must be indicted how hillary clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital remember this is the same bloodsoaked albright who advocated bombing yugoslavia and then got her investment firm to attempt a takeover of mines in that country like the clintons she also knows how to abuse her power lest we forget albright also justified the deaths of half a million iraqi children and claimed that the deaths were worth it and the icing on the cake for this particularly nasty woman albright has already threatened women in america and claimed that there was a special place in hell reserved for them if they did not vote for hillary clinton
there is already talk of joe biden in the frame as secretary of state under hillary clinton biden would continue his antiindia agenda and try to thwart the development of indias space programme and other technological advancements then of course there is hillarys closest confidante a duplicitous lady called huma abedin who is of pakistani descent and whose family has links to radical elements in pakistan and saudi arabia abedin could end up playing an important role in determining american foreign policy and would be certainly antimodi
another point against hillary clinton is that the hawkish henry kissinger has supports her and her oeuvre as secretary of state this is the same kissinger who is so hostile against india many of his racist statements are even on tape to that end
it is in the light of this setting that many indianamericans have opposed the candidacy of hillary clinton and have come out in support of donald trump in contrast to the policies of the clintons trump has promised to make india the best friend of the us and has stated that he looks forward to working with prime minister narendra modi trump has also reached out to hindus in us while there is always a risk of the unknown and it is not clear if trump can make the change he wants to a hillary presidency will certainly be a major step back for india
in order for india to build a constructive relationship with us it requires people in both countries to have good intentions it is clear that india cannot have a strong and forward looking relationship with the us if hillary clinton is running the corridors of power on the other hand donald trump has articulated the right intent and his stance holds promise for india",2016-10-30

288,no title,"the article explains a lot of the background to the white helmets and asks some important questions about the relations between government and ngos or as the author terms them neargovernment organisations the author should also be commended for the extensive bibliography
the author suggests that the truth about the white helmets may lie somewhere in the middle that the white helmets is a dualpurpose organisation with both humanitarian and propaganda functions
the author offers no evaluation of the video evidence provided by the white helmets which to a number of people seems incontrovertably fake and staged if this video evidence is indeed faked then it invites the question why is this necessary where are all the real casualties hasnt the russian bombing killed any civilians at all
the scd or white helmets counts nearly  rescue workers this claim comes only from the white helmets it could well be that the foreign office is paying for  salaries but whether those drawing
them are occupied in fulltime humanitarian work is another matter
after watching carefully the dubious video footage of rescue scenes and the far more convincing footage of white helmets participating in torture and abuse of prisoners it is difficult to see how the white
helmets are anything more than a set of expensive props and uniforms provided to extremist groups in aleppo and idlib and donned for propaganda purposes or when other uniforms are in the wash
furthermore given that the white helmets are funded by the governments and organisations who are totally unmoved by the plight of civilians in the greater part of syria the idea that these bodies would pay for humanitarian duties on the part of the white helmets seems somewhat optimistic
if the white helmets are have a dualpurpose function it is not propagandisthumanitarian but propagandistterrorist
i would also take issue with the statement the sad thing is that avaaz has learned nothing from its own campaign for a nofly zone in libya this view like the idea that the us etc keep making mistakes is following a mistaken policy presupposes that avaaz is wellintentioned that it opposes the destruction of iraq libya syria iran russia",2016-10-31

an elite stratum of wealthy and politically dominant people intends to make hillary clinton our next president these are the oligarchs the  whose wealth and incomes continue growing while most american struggle in her private life hillary clinton is wellpositioned among this cohort and they expect her as president to protect their wealth and maintain their dominance she will
to assure the oligarchs success the democratic national committee is brutalizing the presidential electoral process willfully violating rules laws and precedent the strategy succeeded in the primary elections and it will win the general
who are these people the top  of wealthholders numbers about  million predominantly they are citizens whose wealth depends on the huge american domestic and transnational corporations either directlyexecutives directors investors contractors suppliersor indirectly in other ways eg investment bankers hedge fund managers consultants top law firms two preeminent names in this grouping are hillary and bill clinton whose net worth about  million qualifies the couple for the  stratum by a factor of  others are wall street bankersthe clintons primal financial benefactors and firstname friends lloyd blankfein jamie dimon robert rubin brian moynihan michael corbat james gorman timothy geithner john stumpf etc a more accurate description of the  would be the corporate elite 
candidate clintons relationship to her elite compatriots is one of rigid interdependence she needs their financial and political resources to win the election and they need her in the white house to sustain their privileged status
this privileged status did not result from accident random chance or neglect it is a consequence of public policies consciously adopted over the past three or four decades which shift wealth and incomes systematically upward cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy for example while exporting  of the nations manufacturing jobs in the process our democracy was transformed public policy is crafted today not primarily to advance the welfare of the nations people but to create protect or enhance the financial interests of american corporate enterprise this is acknowledged in the statements of public figures and supported in rigorous scholarly research 
more a new email investigation on clinton could hasten the democratic partys demise the banana republic of america democracy be damned to the superdelegates stand tall in statesmanship anointment of hillary clinton exposes a democracy that never was though easily identifiable the corporate elite has not constructed a conscious conspiracy against the american people at large with a preplanned agenda strategy and tactics but they share a common mindset they are networked by personal acquaintance and they are driven by a common imperative their wealth and political dominance depend on the existing configurations of american domestic and foreign policy both of which must be maintained essentially intact to sustain the groups position of privilege alterations in the status quo can be tolerated only if they are cosmetic slight and at the margin
instead of conspiracy the preeminence of the oligarchs is better seen as a malignant condition of contemporary american government resulting from years of institutional decay and corruption  the story of moribund democracy is detailed here  the economic and political power of megacorporationsincreasingly fewer but ever largerhas displaced functional democracy
yes we vote as we always have but voting and democracy are not interchangeable terms the russian people voted for vladimir putin the iraqis voted for saddam hussein and voting isnt a prerequisite for democracy to function the ancient greeks chose their representatives by lottery
the priority of corporate interests has been achieved by three powerful mechanisms
perhaps the least recognized is the degree to which corporate personnel enter government to staff the highest levels of the executive branch
a new book by political scientists bastiaan van apeldoorn and nana de graaff carries a sobering title american grand strategies and corporate elite networks  they looked into the grand strategy makers the  most influential people in cabinetlevel and senior advisory positions in the last three administrationsbill clintons bushs and obamas in the clinton administration  of the  grand strategy makers  were linked to  different transnational or financial corporations as executives directors senior associates or partners in law firms either prior to their public service or after it in the bush administration  of the   had connections to  corporations in the obama administration  of the  over  had such toplevel corporate affiliations with  companies
smoking guns examples of wealthshifting upward to the already rich certainly  the repeal of the glasssteagall act rammed through in the bill clinton administration by treasury secretary robert rubin from citigroup this enabled the subprime loan frenzy enriching the new york banks but destroying  trillion in americans household wealth  halliburtons nobid obscenely profitable contracts in iraq served up by vice president richard cheney during the bush administration billions of taxpayers dollars to the corporation mr cheney once chaired  in the obama administration treasury secretary timothy geithner from wall street administered the troubled asset relief program bailing out his colleagues banks again with billions of taxpayers money
for the last  years the executive branch has been dominated by the corporate elite
two other mechanisms of corporate influence are far more familiar the corporate financing of political campaigns and the ubiquitous enterprise of lobbying
the two practices are related in direct proportion the more you accept in contributions from boeing say the more you feel obligated to yield to their lobbyists wishes
your policymaking independence will decrease then as the costs of campaigning rise and contemporary costs are staggering a representative today must raise on average  million in campaign funding a senator  million a presidential race runs in the hundreds of millions hillary clinton has taken in  million since citizens united corporate campaign funding has no limits and with candidates in need of so many millions the corporate capture of federal governance is undeniable and scarcely surprising
undeniable but easily surmounted we once had a law on the books the uk still does limiting not campaign contributions but campaign expenditures the limits were  for a senate race  for a representative sums easily provided from personal assets and those of family and friends reenacting such a law would break the corporate stranglehold intense lobbying might continue but no senator no representative would feel the courteous urge to accommodate the welfare of the american people could regain priority the impact on the oligarchs however would be apocalyptic
the commitment of the corporate elite to sustain the status quo is apparently absolute by april of  the democratic national committee and the clinton campaign were one indistinguishable juggernaut intent on blitzing the presidential campaign like hitlers wehrmacht stormed through europe the watch words seemed to be first and most they amassed an early warchest of a hundred million dollars or so and lined up  superdelegate endorsementsall before there was a single announced opponent they invited  print and television journalists to meetings in early april to help in framing the hrc message and framing the race  among them were george stephanoplous and  others from abc rachel maddow and  more from msnbc gloria borger and  of her colleagues from cnn and  from the new york times bloomberg politico and cbs each sent along two
the firstandmost strategy worked secretary clinton preempted the candidate space the only others attracted to the race were lackluster lightweights especially the wooly socialist from vermont but senator sanders electrifying rallies made tangible the disgust of the american people with the status quo  sanders proposals were anything but cosmetic slight and at the margin they posed a mortal threat to the corporate elite and its guardian the clinton campaign to minimize sanders exposure dnc chair wassermanschultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games sanders had to sue to gain access to the dncs voter database the deliberate tilting of the democratic primaries gained momentum
to minimize sanders exposure dnc chair wassermanschultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games
this may not be the first election in which ethics and law were abandoned but never before has it been so reliably exposed
not by the mainstream media though they either ignored the increasingly evident fraud or were complicit in it from the iowa caucuses onward the press treated clintons superdelegate endorsements as tallied votes this continued even after the distortion and dishonesty of doing so were pointed out based on precisely that deception however the associated press announced clintons presumptive nomination on monday june one day before primaries were held in california montana new jersey north and south dakota and the district of columbia from iowa forward also the washington post and the new york times hammered the sanders campaign without mercy or interruption the story was detailed later by thomas frank in harpers magazine   frank concludes i have never before seen the press take sides like they did this year openly and even gleefully badmouthing candidates who did not meet with their approval 
no the major media failed to expose the fraud but the social media and the internet abounded with skepticism sanders fans questioned the uncounted caucuses in iowa the  reduction of polling places in maricopa county arizona the disqualified sanders delegates at the nevada convention the cheapshot call by the associated press many were certain the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee were joined at the hip but there was scant factual evidence
enter julian assange and the leaked dnc emails now the illegal collusion was documented the sabotaging of the sanders campaign exposed wassermanschultz resigns as dnc chair then the podesta emails and hillarys paid speeches you need both a public position and a private position my dream is a hemispheric open market with open trade and open borders dnc vicechair donna brazile a cnn pundit emails the clinton campaign prior to the debate from time to time i get the questions in advance the attempt to reschedule the illinois primary another tranche of emails arrives braziles complicity with the clinton campaign is broadened she is firedresigns from her cnn post the clinton foundation hosts pay to play the clintons personal enrichment the  million deal with king mohammed vi of morocco
finally the compliant mass media did take note this is after all fine spectacle noted but not pursued no determined effort was undertaken to investigate to document further the deceit and dishonesty and to assess its magnitude
once again that was left to the citizenry the first careful detailed study was published june   by two scholars axel geijel of tilburg university and rodolfo cortes barragan at stanford it is entitled are we witnessing a dishonest election they compared states whos voting systems produced verifying paper trails against states which did not sanders won the papertrail states where tampering with machine tallies could be quickly discovered clinton overpowered in states without paper trails where tampering could never be detected the authors also compared voting machine tallies with exit poll figures and found disturbing discrepancies they concluded these data suggest that election fraud is occurring in the  democratic party presidential primary election this fraud has overwhelmingly benefited secretary clinton at the expense of senator sanders the paper can be found here 
then with the primaries concluded a group of outraged patriots with day jobs organized as election justice usa  published an exhaustive report the study is entitled democracy lost a report on the fatally flawed  democratic primaries  and it is available here  it details in  pages of carefully assembled and compelling evidence examples of election fraud uncovered in four categories voter suppression registration tampering illegal voter purging and fraudulent voting machine tallies in eleven states the group found discrepancies between exit polls and voting machine counts exceeding the statistical margins of error every single discrepancy favored secretary clintonand no such discrepancies occurred in the republican counts the groups conclusion was troubling  elected delegates their report argues persuasively were awarded fraudulently to clinton and denied sanders accordingly
that gave her the edge in delegate count going into the convention in the end however she needed the additional votes of  unelected superdelegates those empowered by the democratic national committee even after a primary season documented as fraudulent then hillary clintons nomination was achieved by fiat not democracy
but the corporate elite will not be denied given the clintondnc expertise and success in tipping the primary elections she will be elected president in the general election guaranteed
the manipulation of the primaries was obscure but not invisible a backlash of outrage might have been anticipated the clintondnc people however are unmatched in hubris and geniuses in the practice of deceit scandals were not even acknowledged defiantly ignored and the language of progressive democracy is omnipresent in the campaigning brilliant deception hillary clinton promises to work for main street not wall street she promises to bring back jobs improve education seek equal pay for women boost the minimum wage expand civil rights provide free college education move toward medicare for all oppose tpp break up the toobigtofail wall street banks fine appealing proposals all but this is the language of sanders revolution and the corporate elite will stand for none of it
but folk wisdom tells us to take campaign promises lightly and the american people are forgiving and trusting hillary clinton is a woman of long experience and we want to believe our democracy is robust
here now we need to be vigilant

regarding federal elections this concept of democracy within the largest most lethal military power the world has ever seen is bogus to begin with when us citizens cast ballots to elect a new commanderinchief who will continue the project of perpetual war military industrial profits and global hegemony how democratic is that the vast majority of those who will suffer and die dont get to vote the only exceptions are members of the us armed services who die in us wars if those on the other side of the pentagons crosshairs were able to vote im sure they would elect our green party presidential candidate jill stein who said we say to trump we dont need no friggin wall we just need to stop invading other countries her running mate vice presidential candidate ajamu baraka has called the humanitarian interventionist argument a new version of the white mans burden and said you have to ask yourself when was the last time the us has been on the side of the people and the answer is never
more top aide to hillary clinton urges the fbi to disclose what it knows about trumps russia ties what will hillary clinton do for india not much and heres why clintons policies look like a death sentence for americans  things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency how do you explain the dynastic governance clinton is the american dream in all its glory
im not sure i can explain the clinton dynasty except to agree that it is one chelsea has been very involved in the clinton foundation and is quite likely to enter political life and even run for president one day we have had other political dynasties most notably the roosevelts the kennedys and the bushes and there are many lower level dynasties like the browns in california jerry brown the current governor of california is the son of former california governor pat brown new york state has the cuomos governor andrew cuomo is the son of former governor mario cuomo and his brother chris cuomo is a prominent corporate television host
regarding the american dream i assume youre referring to the dream that if you work hard and play by the rules you can achieve some proportionate degree of status security and prosperity if so the clintons certainly arent living the american dream because although they did well in school theyve hardly played by the rules theyve enriched themselves with that welloiled influence peddling operation i mentioned earlier the clinton foundation and the clinton global initiative were all wondering whether hillary clinton and maybe even bill clinton might finally be indicted now that the fbi has reopened its investigation of clinton email because more of it was discovered on the laptop that anthony weiner  a former congressman under fbi investigation for sex offense  shared with his wife clinton aide huma abedin if hillary clinton is elected shell have to be impeached convicted and removed from office but thats extremely unlikely  no matter whats in the newly discovered email  if her party the democrats win a majority in the house and more than a one third minority in the senate it takes a majority in the house to impeach a president and a twothirds majority in the senate to then convict and remove a president so hillary clinton is at a berlusconi moment in her sordid career her best chance of avoiding indictment is getting elected getting back to the american dream that you can get ahead by working hard and playing by the rules bill clinton was impeached by the house of representatives for perjury and obstruction of justice regarding his affair with a yearold white house intern and his testimony in a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by another former employee however his own party held a majority in the senate and they acquitted him this was all legal according to the us constitution but does it really sound like he was playing by the rules during the final days of his presidency clinton acquitted glencore international founder mark rich an international fugitive who had fled to switzerland his exwife had donated to the democratic national committee the clinton presidential library and hillary clintons new york senate campaign
according to the law president clinton had the authority to acquit rich but how would any rational person consider that anything but bribery and corruption
in  clinton polished the reputation of president nursultan nazarbayev kazakhstans autocratic leader and human rights offender who then gave a uranium mining lease to canadian businessman frank giustras shell company making it worth tens of millions of dollars overnight giustra then made a big contribution to the clinton foundation no one has claimed that this was illegal but is it playing by the rules
when guistra sold a majority stake in his company uranium one to rosatom the russian atomic energy agency it was approved by secretary of state hillary clinton giustra then contributed  million to the clinton foundation and bill clinton was offered a  speaking engagement with a russian investment bank with links to the kremlin does that sound like playing by the rules and now hillarys trying to make us believe that russias meddling in our elections and threatening confrontation with russia over syria i dont think shes kidding about the confrontation but the clinton foundation rarely passes up the chance to make another million dollars or more in any circumstances
meanwhile most of the rest of us are not living the american dream sixtythree percent of americans are living on the edge of financial catastrophe unable to handle a  car repair or a  emergency room bill  the clintons as i said serve the oligarchy they have also managed to join when bill clinton was on his way out in the last months of his presidency he worked with republicans in the lame duck congress to deregulate the banking industry by  its dishonest excessive and abusive financialization scams had crashed the economy costing millions of americans their jobs andor homes then as a new york senator hillary clinton voted to bail out the big banks who committed the crime while many of the rest of us struggled in the crashs wake
how do you explain that candidate clinton who failed as secretary of state with the death of the us ambassador in libya her health problems the scandal of emails is the candidate of the democrats
again clinton serves the interests of the oligarchy that she herself has joined many people believe that the nomination was stolen from bernie sanders the democratic candidate who spoke out against oligarchy growing income inequality and even the israeli lobbys dominance in american politics
but theres one other important element to this americans who identify as liberals supporters of womens rights andor antiracists have such a longstanding allegiance to the democratic party that supporting its nominee every four years is their kneejerk reaction ever escalating foreign wars dont seem to penetrate their consciousness or conscience especially when those wars are waged primarily with drones and proxy armies instead of us troops and once the republicans nominated the openly racist and misogynistic donald trump defeating trump became a liberal crusade
there are of course glimmers of rationality and hope yesterday i was out canvassing for an oakland california ballot measure with a young black man a college sophomore despite trumps overt racism he told me that he considers clinton even more dangerous because he understands that she has essentially promised confrontation with russia over syria he understands that such escalation increases the chance of a nuclear war accidental or not and that trump for all his faults says that the cold war is over that nato is largely obsolete and that clinton is recklessly risking confrontation with russia by promising to remove bashar alassad
our green party presidential candidate jill stein is reported to be polling at  among voters under  and much of bernie sanderss support was quite visibly from the same age group local grassroots organizing is also empowering people to create institutions free of oligarchic and corporate control they include community gardens renewable energy buyers cooperatives and gmofree zones if a ballot initiative to make californias sonoma county gmofree passes the whole northwest coast of california will be a gmofree zone from santa cruz to humboldt counties and including one inland county trinity
dont you think that the twoheaded american system with the candidates of two traditional parties democratic and republican is out of breath
i wouldnt say its out of breath because its still very much in control however trump has left the republican party in disarray with many republican luminaries and funders defecting to clinton who is welcoming them with open arms as black agenda report editor glen ford has written  the clintons have succeeded in assembling under one party roof nearly the whole of the us ruling class and their hordes of attendants and goons the scam that undergirded the duopoly system that has served the lords of capital so well for so long has come undone thanks to a white nationalist billionaire who was too spoiled to play by the corporate rules the two parties of the ruling class have become one
its hard to say whether or not the republican party will survive this election or what it will be in another four years if it does
one possibility could significantly change this if green party presidential candidate dr jill stein wins  in this election the green party will become an official national party eligible for  of the federal funds made available to official national parties to host their presidential nominating conventions and support their nominee this year all federal funds went to the two official national parties republicans and democrats who also have access to huge amounts of plutocratic and corporate money the greens take no corporate money
five percent of the vote and five percent of the federal funding for elections may not sound like much but it would be a huge watershed for the us greens it would be a big psychological and visibility boost and it would mean starting the next presidential campaign year with more than twice the funds that jill steins campaign has been able to raise
winning  would also ensure ballot access for the greens in most states not only in federal elections but also in down ballot races as it is greens are required to spend much of their time and money just gathering enough signatures to satisfy all the byzantine ballot access requirements that vary in each of the  states
everyone knows that clinton is the future president of the usa in your opinion why they are facilitated her task and who has interest in seeing clinton in the oval office
she is backed by the oligarchy corporate and dynastic particularly the investment bankers the oil industry and the weapons manufacturers who not only profit but also lobby for foreign wars they are advancing their own interests by promoting a candidate who will serve them liberals have been conditioned to function as unpaid clinton operatives in this election and the corporate media like the cops serve as protectors of the oligarchy and again the majority of americans are politically disengaged
you are close to jill stein head of the green party which emerged late in the campaign why was this alternative sabotaged
well i wouldnt say im close to jill personally but she knows who i am and i of course know who she is ive reported on her campaign and on the us greens for the past year on radio and in print and online outlets and im always honored when she shares those reports on her social media pages i write for the black agenda report and feel politically and intellectually close to its editors who have given their full support to the green party this year even as bernie sanders surged in the polls and many imagined he might actually win the democratic nomination in these times that are so easy to see as the end times shared rationality and humanity are the closest bonds that many of us have regardless of the geographic distance between us
jills campaign could hardly compete with the republicans and democrats because neither she nor any other greens solicit or accept corporate money we stand behind the slogan people and planet before profits and we call for a halt to the death march led by the weapons manufacturers fossil fuel giants and agrochemical companies who profit from it jill calls for immediately cutting the military budget by half closing all the us military bases in foreign countries and launching a peace offensive she proposes free public education from kindergarten through college the abolition of student debt national health insurance and a green new deal that would reinvest the resources now squandered on weapons manufacture and all the illegal immoral lethal and environmentally catastrophic us wars the green new deal would create a renewable energy infrastructure and sustainable agriculture before its too late to stop the climate meltdown  if it isnt too late already and it would fully employ americans in meaningful dignified and cooperative work for the common good
of course that all makes far too much sense and threatens the highly concentrated wealth and power of the deathmarch industries i would not be surprised if there were voter fraud to prevent jill stein and ajamu baraka from winning the  that would make us an official national party
i have also seen enormous oligarchic determination to stop greens at the local level in  matt gonzalez the green partys mayoral candidate in san francisco seemed to have a good chance of winning that so alarmed the democratic party that it sent all its best known most powerful names and faces to san francisco to campaign for the democratic candidate they sent hillary and bill they sent jesse jackson they sent many democratic party superstars more than once they seemed to be more concerned about defeating matt gonzalez and the greens in san francisco than they were about defeating george bush and the republicans in the following years presidential election
one of the founders of the san francisco green party was elected to the city and county board of supervisors twice but when he ran for sheriff an executive office democrats pulled him aside and said they could not allow his election unless he left the greens and joined the democratic party which he did they still got rid of him after his first term with a really ugly campaign but thats another complicated story in itself the city and county of san francisco once had more elected greens than any city or county in the country but many of those that greens worked so hard to elect have since defected to the democratic party for the sake of their political careers
is not hillary clinton a danger for humanity
hell yes i agree with congolese author and political activist patrick mbeko who said shes more dangerous than isis for all the reasons ive already mentioned her dark alliance with the deathmarch industries and her seeming eagerness to confront russia over syria andor on russias borders in the interest of global hegemony russian uranium deal aside i think that diana johnstone was most likely right when she wrote that her strategic ambition in a nutshell is regime change in russia
and i have to mention my friends from the african great lakes region  particularly uganda rwanda burundi and the democratic republic of the congo  which became the killing grounds of the s as the us using african proxies established itself as the dominant power there most of my friends from that part of the world are horrified by the clintons all but certain return to the white house the clintons are deeply committed to the false history of the rwandan war and massacres that was used to justify the first and second congo wars and later the humanitarian interventions in libya syria and iraq if the truth about rwanda and dr congo were known bill clinton would be implicated in mass murder but thats true of every us president in office in my lifetime and probably long before that no ones going to try to refer the most lethal military power in history to an international criminal court with more than symbolic authority
you have many worked on africa how do you explain the french leadership in africa
well im no expert in this but i can say a few things
first i wouldnt call it leadership id say that france sustains a neocolonial and military presence in africa france was a partner in the destruction of libya in mali niger the central african republic and the democratic republic of congo france is protecting the uranium mines essential to the nuclear power that generates  of its electricity theres no doubt that france was complicit in the assassination of resource nationalist and debt resister president thomas sankara and the installation of president blaise compaoré in burkina faso i dont see any sign that french policy towards burkina or any of its other former colonies is any more benign now despite its resignation to compaorés ouster by a popular movement
france and the us now appear to be military partners in africa more often than not but during the rwandan war and massacres and the congo wars of the s the us displaced france as the dominant power there
however a source of ongoing tension between france and the us has been their divergent accounts of the massacres known as the rwandan genocide the us defends rwandan president paul kagames account in which he is the savior who swept in to stop the carnage kagame blames france particularly for operation turquoise in which french troops created a humanitarian corridor for rwandan refugees mostly hutus who were fleeing the advance of kagames rwandan patriotic army this conflict has recently been renewed first with france reopening its investigation of allegations that kagame ordered the assassination of rwanda and burundis hutu presidents juvenal habyarimana and cyprien ntaryamira in  rwanda responded by accusing  french officers of helping to plan and organize genocide in rwanda
in  nicholas sarkozy attempted to ease the tension between france and the us and rwanda by accepting the usrwandan account of the massacres he publicly apologized for frances alleged guilt in rwandas tragedy  and shortly thereafter france was rewarded with greater access to dr congos resource riches however alain juppé who was the french prime minister at the time of the rwandan massacres and operation turquoise was having none of that he even left the country during kagames  reconciliaton visit to paris  now juppé seems to be leading sarkozy in the bid for his partys nomination and if he is elected president the history of rwanda and dr congo in the s will be more fiercely contested most of my rwandan friends very much hope that juppé will be elected because he defends the dissident history of what really happened they believe for one that operation turquoise saved many rwandan lives
while africa is a young continent how do you explain that the countries are often directed by old presidents with several mandates and who dont want lose the power
the old presidents cling to power and the western powers with geostrategic interests enable them because autocrats are easier to corrupt and control than rowdy democrats and resource nationalists who try to represent their own people rwandas kagame and ugandas museveni are two prime examples of autocrats who have proven very useful to the us and other western interests
france the us and all the rest of the nato nations appear to be united in their determination to topple burundis nkurunziza who has dared to raise an independent head and to favor the east particularly russia in resource extraction contracts i cant explain mugabes hold on power at age  or omar albashirs at  since neither are us aliies youll have to ask africans in those countries to explain that
in your opinion is not tribalism a major factor in the destabilization of africa why doesnt africa progress and does it stay in the tribal model
i really hesitate to say anything about that because im not african myself and i think western media often use the word tribe as a racial slur that disguises western resource interests at play in african conflicts i recently wrote a piece about the new film a brilliant genocide  and milton allimadi the ugandanborn editor of the black star news told me he loved the piece but asked me to remove the one instance in which id used the word tribe i told him id been hesitant about using that word and was glad to remove it im now reading his book  hearts of darkness how white writers created the racist image of africa 
why are congolese being massacred in beni territory north kivu province  the first question ive asked to try to answer that question is what resources are there in beni the answer is oil timber gold diamonds wolfram coltan and cassiterite beni is a vivid example of the saying everybody wants a piece of congo no one could convince me that the industrial nations hunger for all these riches is not at the heart of these conflicts why are all the deadly ethnic conflicts in dr congos resourcerich eastern provinces
the competition andor animosity between ethnicities or groups is often real as they are in the west but in africa the geostrategic and resource interests of the industrial nations are always in play behind the scenes western powers often exacerbate local rivalries in pursuit of their own interests
i sometimes cohost a show called afrobeatradio with my friend wuyi jacobs on wbainew york city and we both hope to someday produce a show about rwanda and burundi in which we wont have to use the words hutu or tutsi dr léopold munyakazi convinced me that these two groups are better understood not as tribes or ethnicities but as social classes in rwandan history that were exaggerated by europeans who have found it convenient to pit one group against the other
libya lives total chaos how do you analyze the situation in libya
its horrible like so much else it makes me deeply ashamed to be an american if you read hillary clintons email its easy to see that the usnato war on libya was for one another western war against another defiant resource nationalist muammar gaddafi regardless of whatever human rights offenses gaddafi or saddam hussein were guilty of both were resource nationalists as was mohammed mossadegh the secular democratically elected prime minister of iran who nationalized iranian oil before our cia and the uks m ousted him in the  coup i wrote about how this played out in libya in  clinton email we came we saw we got oil 
obama says that failing to prepare for the aftermath of the libyan war was the greatest mistake of his presidency but id say his greatest mistake was waging the libyan war in the first place like the iraq war it has created chaos and perpetual war that continues to spread through the middle east and north africa

the signing of the comprehensive economic trade agreement with canada ceta on the th of october marks the beginning of north americas annexation of europe the negotiations for the treaty were carried out behind closed doors for over  deputies in the european parliament there are more than  thousands lobbyists the society for european affairs professionals seap  the organisation which lobbying on behalf of multinational corporations  this is the real power block in europe the european worker has absolutely no say and henceforth he will lose the right to form join unions multinational corporations will have unlimited power over european workers who will see the destruction of what is left of social gains won from over a century of class struggle
will european workers lie down and accept this imposture what concrete policies would weaken the stranglehold of corporations over european workers which parties in the current political landscape hold policies which if implemented would weaken the transatlantic stranglehold
there are currently no political parties running in the major european elections with candidates who genuinely represent workers interests but there are some political movements which threaten the corporate powerelite we will mention them below
there are two important geopolitical processes to consider here the first is the eastwest corporate  geopolitical axis america is pulling the european peninsula away from the eurasian continent with the installation of a neonazi regime in kiev washington attempted to recreate an intermarium from the baltic sea to the black sea and down to the eastern mediterranean  driving a permanent wedge between russia and germany
in order to facilitate the social transformation of europe into a america minor millions of pilgrims are necessary hence the deployment of coercive engineered migration as a tool to replace class conscious european workers with deracine youths  in some instances educated enough to do the lowpaid work assigned to them and acculturated enough to pose no problem to the powerelite
in the new trotskyite language of this imperial order any leader who attempts to stem the tide of globalisation through populist appeals to tradition and national identity is fascist fascist is a loaded term which generally connotes evil in the public mind in each european country there is a readymade army of youths from wealthy families whose job is to don hoddies attack police and scream fascist and racist at workingclass people desperately trying to find a way out of this nightmare these antifa are the modern equivalent to oswald mosleys fascist gangs in the s they represent the same class interests pettybourgeois leftism is the new world orders avantgarde
a favourite passtime of the antifa mob is throwing stones at police officers one can only gain acceptance in the antifascist gang by showing how much one hates the pigs so police officers from honest workingclass families get burned alive while the antifa mob chants slogans from the spanish civil war such violence is now a regular occurrence in demonstrations the agents provocateurs often receive help from the intelligence services french police are finding it hard to cope with the chaos developing all over french suburbs they complain that they are not sufficiently equipped and do not have the powers necessary to deal with the growing violence from delinquents they have been demonstrating in paris they have been calling for an end to the control of the french police by free masonry exacerbating the problem is the deepseated racism of many police officers who target black youths with spotchecksm  very often without reason
the recent demonstrations by french police in france against poor working conditions and low pay strongly suggests that there is the possibility that the rank and file of the french police could be waking up to the reality that france is government by a criminal gang after the magnanville terrorist attack in june where two police officers were killed a police officer at the funeral of the deceased refused to shake the hand of president hollande and prime minister manuel valls it was a highly significant act of insubordination
the police who in capitalist societies are the guardians of the ruling class are beginning to realise the criminality of the people they are protecting they are perhaps beginning to understand that the role of the state is to impose the dictatorship of one class over another  that of the minority of super wealthy over the labouring masses
many of these dissident police officers are linked to le pens national front a reliable source in french intelligence informed me that the secret services spend more time watching the farright than the socalled far left they see the far right as a real potential danger to the ruling order whereas the far left present no danger but are in fact a key component of ruling class ideology from the arab spring to nuit debout the farleft are the lifeblood of capitalism the potential of a major split between the national and compradore bourgeoise of imperial states for prospects of workingclass gains is something that needs more study
what should we make of all this in the context of ceta as i have said on numerous occasions the far right in france are and always have been political opportunists who exploit the despair of the masses they serve the interests of the national bourgeoisie but the national front are regularly denounced by the media not for being right wing rather they are dismissed as being closer to the far left the prospect of raising workers salaries nationalisation of key industries and a halt on the importation of cheap labour appeal to workingclass families
as i have pointed out before looking at a debate between the trotskyist jeanluc melanchon and marine le pen in  one would have thought that le pen was was the leftist and melanchon the rightwing militarist melanchon shamelessly defended the nato bombing campaign of libya while le pen opposed it
civil war on the horizon
the rightwing presidential candidate philippe de villiers has said there are plans afoot to divide the french territory between muslims and nonmuslims he quote s francois hollandes own writings to back up his claims everyone is talking about an imminent civil war in the bars and cafes of paris one can hear more and more disgruntled french citizens talking about media disinformation the demonisation of russia the homogenisation of thought and the criminality of the ruling class
the scene has never been more propitious to a populist take over of french politics but one should not have illusions about the national front they are following the menacious zionist narrative on the war on terror muslims are the problem the partys vicepresident forian philippot is close to the ultrazionist lawyer gilleswilliam goldnagel a friend of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu
philippot recently condemned the comments of presidential candidate jean frédéric poisson who said hillary clinton presented the greatest threat for the world as she is in the pay of the zionists poisson was subsequently forced to kneel before the representative council of jewish institutions in france crif where he sought forgiveness he was told he would be forgiven but they they would never forget in spite of the national fronts antimuslim bias an increasing number of muslims are voting for the party many muslims prefer the national front as they are sick and tired of being patronised and manipulated by the left  with their pseudo antiracism and humanitarian wars
there have also been major strikes by police in ireland for similar reasons to france french workers are losing everything and will soon become a lumpen proletariat meanwhile the french government has programmes in place to encourage migrants heading to britain to stay in france the socialist party is creating a new electorate it is a wise move for them because after the next election abstentionism will be the norm and the indigenous lumpen proletariat will resent the migrants the oligarchs will keep the masses in bondage through gmos takfiri antiislam and total reification of life ceta is the beginning of the end for social hope it is the prelude to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip  the most evil trade deal in history
french vicepresident of the trilateral commission herve de carmoy wrote a book in  entitled leuramerique  euramerica where he argues for the formation of what amounts to a transatlantic superstate run by a financial oligarchy ceta is the prelude to that project",2016-11-04

the palestine football association pfa in a first testing of palestines ability to fight its battle with israel in international courts plans to go to the worlds top court for sports in a bid to force its israeli counterpart to view israeli settlements on the west bank as occupied territory rather than an extension of the jewish state
the potential palestinian move follows the palestinian authoritys campaign to isolate israel in international organizations and challenge israels occupation of the west bank in the international criminal court icc
using soccer as a testing ground palestines efforts to confront israel in international organizations has produced mixed results while palestine succeeded in joining various international organizations the pfa last year failed to muster sufficient votes to persuade world soccer body fifa to suspend israel the pfa argued that the policies of the israeli government and the israel football association ifa violated fifa rules as well as international law governing the status of occupied territory
the pfa has since been unable to push fifa towards any punitive steps against israel instead fifa opted to monitor developments and attempt with little success to negotiate a way out of the impasse palestine is expected to take legal recourse if fifa fails to take more decisive action at its next council meeting in january
the pfas focus since failing to get israel suspended has been on banning six clubs that are based in israeli settlements on the west bank from playing in israeli lower divisions fifa rules stipulate that clubs based in a recognized federations territory cannot play in leagues of another soccer association without the permission of the home federation the pfa rejects the notion of granting permission because it believes that it would legitimize israeli settlements and the occupation
more swedish soccer player sent off for loud fart during match pfa president jibril rajoub suggested that the pfa would take its case to the court of arbitration for sport cas after a sevenhour meeting earlier this month of a fifa committee headed by tokyo sexwale failed to resolve the issue
mr sexwale is scheduled to visit israel later this month for a meeting with israeli sports minister miri regev the fifa council is scheduled to discuss the issue at its next meeting in january the pfa is likely to prepare its case for cas but wait with filing it until after the january meeting
israel sees the palestinian demands and threat as strengthening the growing boycott divestment and sanctions movement bds that sees penalization as a means of forcing the jewish state to alter its policies and ultimately withdraw from territory occupied during the  middle east war
condemnation of the israeli occupation and settlements by the united nations security council constitutes the legal basis for the pfas approach as well as potential challenges in international courts
the strength of the palestinian position has been weakened changing persian gulf attitudes towards israel and saudi and united arab emirates pressure on palestine authority president mahmoud abbas persian gulf states despite paying lip service to the palestinian cause have become more public about their informal relations with israel based on common opposition to expanding iranian influence in the region
writing in the kingdoms controlled press a prominent saudi journalist went as far as calling for the establishment of diplomatic relations with israel the uae last year agreed to the opening of an israeli diplomatic mission accredited to the abu dhabibased international renewable energy agency rather than the uae government bahrain as part of an agreement to host next years fifa congress has consented to issue visas to representatives of the ifa israeli nationals are barred from travelling to persian gulf countries
at the same time saudi arabia and the uae have been pressuring mr abbas to resolve his differences with mohammed dahlan the controversial former abu dhabibased gaza strongman who is an archenemy of the palestinian president mr dahlan is widely seen as a successor to year old mr abbas who would be acceptable to israel
israel may be able to count on some degree of tacit persian gulf support within fifa but is likely nonetheless to ultimately have to be seen to be accepting some kind of compromise that throws a bone to the palestinians
the palestinians focus on the israeli west bank teams has however raised the bar for israel an agreement between prime minister benyamin netanyahu and former fifa president sepp blatter struck last year addresses many of the pfas grievances but not the issue of six the west bank teams their status goes to the heart of the palestinianisraeli conflict the legal status of territory occupied by israel since 
under the agreement mr netanyahu proposed to give palestinian players special identity cards and place sports liaison officials at crossings between palestinian areas and those under israeli control in a bid to eliminate obstacles to free movement that complicated the development of palestinian soccer mr netanyahu further suggested to create an escort service that would facilitate players travel between the west bank and gaza that are separated by israeli territory
israel initially appeared to live up to its promises by granting for the first time in  years a west bank team hebrons al ahli passage to gaza to play a palestine cup final against the strips al shejaia hopes that this signalled a new beginning were however dashed when the pfa cancelled the return match in hebron after israel agreed to grant passage to only  of the  players who were scheduled to travel implementation of the agreement has since evaporated
the pfa by putting the west bank teams at the top of their agenda has made it tougher for fifa and israel to work out a compromise that would not have implications for the future of israelipalestinian peace making israeli is likely to want to avoid subjecting its policies to the scrutiny of an international court yet that may be exactly what would best serve the palestine authoritys overall strategy",2016-11-05

ever since the telling of biblical fairy tales few stories have lived up to the hype around the mismatch between the shepherd boy david and the giant goliath in the biblical encounter david prevailed by keeping his foe goliath at a distance with a formidable weapon his sling
today a modernday version of david and goliath is playing out
although granted political asylum by ecuador a target of us empire finds himself ensconced under a form of arbitrary detention in ecuadors london embassy under constant surveillance by british police the fully weaponized us empire which boasts of its fullspectrum dominance has arrayed itself and its allies against one unarmed as in having no conventional weaponry man who heads a publishing organization
this uppity publisher has had the temerity to expose the secret machinations and war crimes of the militaryeconomic albeit faltering on both fronts behemoth to the worlds public the protransparency publisher wikileaks its founder and de facto political prisoner julian assange and antisecrecy collaborators infuriated the united states establishment with a slew of documents emails and graphic exposes like the  collateral murder  video that demonstrated a us military engaged in war crimes
nations states are adamant and fastidious about keeping their internal workings under wraps but it is a oneway street as many nation states seek to gather and store any and all information about the citizenry without seeking court approval or the approval of the citizenry in question
more swedish government implicated in charges against assange un body to rule on arbitrary detention of wikileaks founder websavvy wikileaks objects to this double standard and it welcomes vets and publishes troves of secret information premised on the principle of the publics right to be informed about what their government is up to
evidence makes it clear that the violent american establishment engages in browbeating inciting socalled color revolutions to destabilize and overthrow disobedient governments military encirclement and saber rattling this selfdescribed indispensable nation which preens its might before major nation states such as china and russia was not about to have its fullspectrum dominance challenged by punk computer hackers
leaning on its allies the us enacted a financing squeeze on wikileaks many nation states have been severely crippled and devastated by us sanctions but tiny wikileaks proved more resilient and cleverer than the washington schemers
in an attempt to topple wikileaks the us establishment has sought to lop off the head of wikileaks it has kept close tabs on julian assange and is purportedly behind a scheme to bring assange down in sweden we have been warned that the pentagon for example is thinking of deploying dirty tricks to ruin us
in sweden consensual sex has been parlayed as rape in selfdefense assange spoke to the facts of the situation 
here we have a case the swedish case where i have never been charged with a crime where i have already been cleared by the stockholm prosecutor and found to be innocent where the woman herself said that the police made it up where the united nations formally said the whole thing is illegal where the state of ecuador also investigated and found that i should be given asylum those are the facts but what is the rhetoric
 the un formally found that the whole thing is illegal never even mentioning that ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes i am subject to persecution by the united states
disinformation and distraction are among the underhanded tactics of empire
while in britain assange was eventually placed under house arrest sweden played out the drama while refusing to press charges or interview assange in britain on the allegations it insisted he come to sweden which assange was unwilling to do without an assurance that he would not be deported elsewhere knowing full well that the us department of justice was preparing a case against him sweden refused to give such an assurance which speaks strongly about swedens intent to seek justice for any alleged crimes committed against its citizens
despite all this intrigue wikileaks has continued to publish and assange has continued to give interviews assange did not cower instead he chose to fight back against hillary clinton and the democrats this is because hillary clinton and the democrats are the principals in power and the grand jury investigation into himself and wikileaks has been occurring during their time in government
clinton and the democrats are victims of their own zeal and hubris along the way many outs presented themselves to the democrats they could have dropped the grand jury investigation they could have provided an assurance that there would be no request for assanges deportation from sweden the us could even have given a presidential pardon to assange extremely telling about the caliber of man that assange is is that he offered himself as a prisoner in exchange for the release of another political prisoner chelsea manning
but empire and its minions were dismissive as is the way of empire empire does not negotiate deals it takes what it wants because it believes it can
the result
the corruption in the democratic party has come to light wikileaks revealed that the democratic national committee conspired against party aspirant bernie sanders and heads fell clinton tellingly hired the subsequently fallen dnc chair debbie wasserman schultz
clintons emails were leaked as were those of her campaign chair john podesta revelations include payforplay as they call it giving access in exchange for money to states individuals and corporations a  direct connection between hillary clinton and the foundation of jihadism of isil in the middle east libya more than anyone elses war was hillary clintons war and banks buying cabinet positions
the clinton campaign has predictably been thrown into disarray
the clintonites could not refute what was in their own emails instead they sought to deflect attention elsewhere the clintonites blamed russian hacking for interfering in the us presidential race finally julian assange felt compelled to state 
the clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neomccarthy hysteria that russia is responsible for everything hilary clinton stated multiple times falsely that seventeen us intelligence agencies had assessed that russia was the source of our publications that is false we can say that the russian government is not the source
neither is wikileaks complicit with russia
we have published about  documents of various kinds that relate to russia most of those are critical and a great many books have come out of our publications about russia most of which are critical our russiadocuments have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in russia which they use our documents to back up
graciously toward clinton assange said he feels sorry for the woman who wanted to  drone  him imagine what the response would have been if assange had discussed the possibility of a drone attack against clinton
presently assange downplays the damage from the barrage of leaks to the clinton campaign for the presidency
trump would not be permitted to win why do i say that because hes had every establishment off side trump doesnt have one establishment maybe with the exception of the evangelicals if you can call them an establishment but banks intelligence agencies arms companies big foreign money  are all united behind hillary clinton and the media as well media owners and even journalists themselves
however a counter coup was announced against the coup by clinton cronyism it is said to include fbi cia military intelligence other security organizations through julian assange that have promised to stop clinton from becoming president and to convict and indict her and her cronies
a revolution
no matter what transpires on november  the reverberations from this confrontation should be monumental us democracy has  again  been revealed to be glaringly corrupt most importantly the worlds preeminent militaryindustrial complex has been shown to be susceptible to the power of one person properly framed it is the power of one person to work with other persons to form a greater consciousness a consciousness that ultimately will transcend and defeat the corruption of empire",2016-11-06

an important question is on the  election statewide ballot in massachusetts question  deals with the states charter school cap without the cap upwards of  charter schools could be approved by the state district in the next fiscal year the charter school scam has spread its tentacles into the state ofmassachusetts in large part due to the obama administration a vote no is thus critical toward halting the march of privatization in the education system occurring nationwide as massachusetts residents gear up to vote for the next president of the united states it is important to remember that the transformation of public education into a private good will not cease as long as popular opposition fails to confront its roots in washington
the obama administration immediately created the race to the top program after the  election this program paved a direct path toward the elimination of public education as we know it the department of education funneled billions of us dollars into incentive schemes to privatize public schools district by district federal funds were dangled in front of mostly poor mostly black cities as long as these districts met the mandates of the program these mandates included the closure of failing schools mergers with forprofit charter schools and the complete transformation of public schools into charter laboratories race to the top created favorable conditions for private capitalists to engulf the entire us public education system
the results have been disastrous hundreds of public schools have closed around the country tens of thousands of public school teachers have been fired in new orleans nearly every school operating in the district is a privately owned by  publicly funded charter schools the chicago teachers union recently averted a strike but has been dealing with the consequences of the closure of fifty schools in the city in  
the impact of charter schools has extended beyond teacher layoffs and school closures charter schools have also promoted segregation based on race and class the civil rights project of ucla has found that seventy percent of black charter school students attend intensely segregated charter schools  furthermore charter schools also demand an even more intense policy of standardized testing withcurriculums that are often guided by the test corporations themselves all the while these institutions have found ample time to discriminate against els and disabled students
in addition charter schools have been found to cheat students from a quality education charter schools are even more militarized than traditional public schools and sport higher rates of suspension and expulsion rates corporate charter operators also cream students from the top and toss the rest even so charters have not proven to do any better than public schools in terms of test scores  what the charter school movement does possess is the backing of the elite which has masterfully used media and nonprofit manipulation to demonize public education
the usual capitalist players have been the primary leaders in the drive to rid of the charter school cap in massachusetts the new york lobbying group families for excellent schools is controlled by hedge fund managers whose funds stem from donations from the walton family ie walmart another organization education reform now advocacy has received upwards of  million dollars from the same source  charter schools are often labeled public because they receive tax payer dollars however the schools are accountable to no one except the corporate interests that back them
a yes vote on question two would place the education of students in massachusetts firmly in the hands of the kingpins of privatization not only would twelve charter schools per year be subject to approval but fortyfive public schools would be in danger of closure over  million more dollars per year would be siphoned from public schools across the state at the moment the charter school cap allows the state to operate no more than  charter schools if the cap islifted however this restriction would no longer apply and leave the students families and educatorsvictimto the shock and awe privatization which has characterized national policy for over two decades
opposition to privatization is being led by the organization save our schools save our schools consists of families teachers students and unions that are looking to prevent an era of unbridled privatization in the massachusetts public education system charter schools already drain  million from public education in the stateeach year as it currently stands a vote no would protect public schools and thus the unions that representtheir educators
a no vote would build upon numerous labor victories in the massachusetts area over the last few years the boston school bus drivers union local  won a historic victory against the veolia corporation in  the harvard dining workers of local  unite here followed by defeating harvards bid to raise healthcare costs in october of  now it is time to stand with teachers across the state in their effort to prevent fullscale privatization
doing so will not be easy the model of unionmanagement cooperationwith thedemocratic party continues to prevent workers in massachusetts and across the country from taking offensive action against the privatization assault a vote no on question  in massachusetts would show that community and union members can organize a successful pushback against the forces behind privatization however a vision of transformation and radical change must be articulated if defense of public education is to materialize into a peoples movement the fight against privatization must be placed in the contextof the larger struggle to build a world that working and oppressed people would vote yes to",2016-11-06

professor mike mahon president and vice chancellor lethbridge canada
dear professor mike mahon
it is with a sense of great sadness that i have learnt of the suspension without pay of professor anthony hall one of the most distinguished scholars not only of the  but a researcher and writer who is recognised and respected globally in a country like pakistan which is far behind canada in term of education research and scholarship no teacher or nonteacher of any university can be suspended without pay when someone is suspended he or she is entitled to draw full pay for the period of suspension if canada is doing better than us on various scales then one would expect that suspension without pay puts canada behind us in terms of due process and in terms of requirements demanded by the principles of justice and fair play i may add respectfully that in pakistani universities no one is generally suspended unless a fact finding committee has first looked into the matter thoroughly and found prima facie evidence of wrong doing the decision of the administration also destroys the concept of a tenured appointment
 from his writings that i have read over a period of time it is evident that professor anthony hall is a scholar whose work exposes the crimes and conspiracies of those who are taking the world headlong into a global war and simultaneously transforming it into a global slave state his analysis is impeccable and his grasp of facts masterly and his writings are devoid of any prejudice against any ethnic group or nation  or any university for that matter should have been proud to have professor hall on its faculty his suspension creates an impression even from this distance from where i write that certain powerful interests that aim destroying free speech have targeted people like professor anthony hall who speak out for democracy decency peace and justice
i have found out from the internet that bnai brithis behind this movement against shutting down free speech it is quite evident that the charge that professor anthony hall has created a discriminatory atmosphere is highly dubious to the contrary it appears that an antimuslim bias has been created in your institution by professor halls unfortunate suspensionthere is also a strong impression that bnai brith has taken over the administrative decision making at lethbridge
more suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere irish human rights activists against freedom of speech bnai brith attack on canadian professor has roots in zionist false flag tactics it is also worrying that bnai brith have now targeted canadian universities and canadian society if this is the case then the situation is disturbing not just for lethbridge and canada but for all freedom loving people worldwide when i was a young student at university of edinburgh scotland in the s i used to meet many canadian students and i found that they invariably stood for freedom of speech and for tolerance and justice the suspension of professor hall is inconsistent with my image of the canadian people that i had then formed
on behalf of the academic community of the university of the punjab established  i urge you to kindly reconsider your decision to suspend professor hall it will go a long way in rehabilitating the impression of people worldwide about the upholding of free speech academic freedom and genuine scholarly discourse at lethbridge

usa usa usa they chanted together in the hilton ballroom as the results came in who needs polls they never gave him a chance but now we have it president donald trump not only were the polls spectacularly wrong who will ever trust this particularly bankrupt form of moralising presumptive analysis and telling us how we do and should feel but also the pundits who were not just arrogant about the fact that trump had no chance but also were hopelessly out of touch with what america was thinking across its societal spectrum what it wanted what was felt deep in its blood
it is a rejection of the liberal consensus the entire west has wallowed in since the s and a rejection of obama and the false hope he decried the impotent nature of us political leverage around the world and the rejection of brazen corruption and questionable ethics as typified by crooked hillary
the world must live with it democracy has spoken and theyre going to have to get over the words president trump some will head for the hills some will run to canada others will continue to cry but as obama said yesterday regardless of the result tomorrow the sun will still shine
this is a cry for american exceptionalism and like him or not trump typifies that he is committed to education and demands high performance selling well is an admirable skill for a president to have negotiating with congress internationally etc is exceptionally useful trump has taken beatings financially and come out smelling like a rose
trumps business experience involves negotiations with business leaders and even governments around the world and he likely has connections behind the scenes that surpass those of simply purely political candidates  this gives him keen realistic insights into economics in different parts of the world as well as additional avenues to pursue trade agreements and even perhaps some nuanced insights of particular financial weaknesses of possible global competitors not to mention experience and insight into the partnerships andor antagonism between different industries and particular governments
more trumps sexual predator characteristics  his grandfather was a pimp but at least he paid the women he hired the significance of the gops attempted purge of donald trump trump turkey and police tyranny the crisis of imperialism finds political expression an america in denial this vote comes down to the reckoning that for too long politicians have sold the american people out to foreign nations and global industry what donald trump is doing is representing the absolute heartbreak and anger and frustration at a government gone mad and it seems the left completely underestimated that in their vitriol in crying nevertrump and portraying him as the devil incarnate
although it is entirely true that trump is ostentatious and has his mistakes he brings something to the presidential table no other candidate had before he speaks his mind
america clearly is sick of weasel politicians who are too afraid to say what people want to hear they want the facts straight
president trump isnt cut from the political class that class which is entrenched in its selfinterest and has let the country down time and time again ross perot once said that we need somebody to clean out the stables a corrupted ethically questionable president is therefore not the answer in order to accomplish that and im not talking about donald trump
trump is a pragmatist in an era of rapidly approaching chaos he is not a social engineer a think tanker who wants to please those lining his bank accounts the liberal democratic policies of obama us rep nancy pelosi us sen harry reid and their company created a climate that has led to this decision today
so what if his language is intemperate and insulting even lacking in nobility from time to time how can a true changemaker be straitjacketed by politically correct chains if he or she must express the will of the people uncomfortable concerns that lie dormant for far too long
obama won because conservative voters stayed home he had promise and he let so many down what did clinton have and that is why conservative voters had to get out and vote
trump prefers isolationism on a world scale clinton voted to take us to war in iraq and to overthrow libyas gaddafi all in the guise of being muscular
perhaps todays landmark and historic decision is not so much about trumps strengths and power but more about the crippled weakness of the country in  and you simply cannot blame him for that",2016-11-07

attending million of shias in arbaeen create a massive and international unity among shias 
karbala can be a symbol of unity and allegiance to imam that has the worlds effects the start of husseini magnetic attraction is in arbaeen this is the magnetic that exists in my and your heart over the centuries
so if we cant publish the shia massage efficiently in hajj we can universalize it in shia glorious presence in the husseini massive rally
in fact the hajj pilgrimage for imam hussein followers is in karbala their try between safa and marvah in the  beyn alharamain and their ihram clothes is the mourning clothes for aba abdallah
walking to shrines is topical
imam hassan askari peace be upon him mentioned that one of the real believers sign is walking to visit imam hussein in arbaeen
imam sadigh peace be upon him told to one of his followers visit imam husseins shrine and dont give it up i asked what is the reward for visiting him imam pbuh stated when you walk to visit imam hussein allah gives you a reward and removes your guilt and raises your grade
at the other time imam sadigh said if someone goes out of his home and walks to visit imam husseins shrine allah gives him a reward and removes him guilt for each step to visit aba abdallah when he reaches to shrine allah considers him among righteous favorites when his rites finish allah registers him among success when he is coming back an angel of god stays on him and tells the messenger of allah says hello and gives tidings to you that all your faults are forgiven start again your actions
walking tradition has an old history
in a way walking tradition for imam hussein in arbaien has an old history walking to visit karbala was customary at sheikh
ansarys time but it was forgotten for a long time it revives again by sheikh mirza hussein noori he walked to visit aba abdallah in  hegira for the last time
although visiting imam hussein s shrine was often difficult and pilgrims were not safe and secure but they were willing to take risks and had an audience to imam hussein in arbaeen
islamic life style
at that time with full of great interest and knowledge in the way hussein path that leads to karbala shias called each other just with hussein visitors zayer alhussein or hussein server khadem olhussein that is a symbol of islamic life style
pilgrims of this holy and spiritual journey have a lot of blessing and gifts from god such as the nice spiritual state with holy sayyed alshohada  generous dealing with pilgrims entertaining and receiving by hussein servers sacrificing and respecting for each other treating elders and sayyeds kindly and considerately visiting the imam husseins holy shrine in arbaeen
role and place of imam husseins visitors
visiting aba abdallah is a good evidence of esteeming and honoring the divine rituals and display love and friendship with prophets household according to the quranic verse of mavaddat
imam husseins holy shrine visitors enter into heaven before all their guilt is disappeared their life will be long and god provides for them and removes their sadness and sorrow
of course if this old tradition that is established again after destruction of iraqi dictator not to be cultural pathology it will certainly have the negative effects
because every phenomenon is threatened it seems if this pilgrimage tradition becomes a primer to the cultural work it will be more effective and blessings than today",2016-11-08
305,arise president trump or why its not the end of the world as we know it,"prof rafiq islam responds to the vicechancellor of the university of punjab outlining the background of the hall case at the  shares
   
dear vice chancellor kamran
salam from the east coast of canada
thank you for taking the time to address this important issue regarding professor hall like yourself we all have been stunned by the voracity of dr mahons action we used to think academics of certain reputation were above the reach of the tentacles of the establishment we all hoped that a president would not resort to such a shameless pandering to a special interest group however bnai brith is not just a special interest group it is perhaps the most vindictive organization that has ever received prominence in the west allow me to elaborate
you have correctly identified bnai brith to be behind this movement against shutting down free speech while this statement is accurate this phenomenon of targeting canadian universities and canadian society is not something that started now not too long ago it used to be branded as the hidden hand behind the hidden hand during the harper era this operation became a fullblown politically driven policy directive the legislation that dr mahon pathetically relies upon is a product of the harper era harper had an extremist rightwing background and organizations like bnai brith have channelled that extremism to accomplish their hateful agenda as early as the s i personally observed the spirit of this unholy union during my tenure as the president of muslim student association at the university of alberta although harper didnt attend that university we were not too far from the epicentre of the neoconservatism movement that was brewing in canada we fastforward  years and come upon the type of events such as professor hall travesty that are products of that time in fact a web of such operations has been in full force for sometime in every aspect of canadian lives only recently we had this court ruling against canadian security intelligence service that was illegally spying on the public this gangsterlike involvement started in  shortly after harper and the neocon came to power
this is not to say that the public is protected from such unconscionable manoeuvring under a liberal government in fact the most notorious scandals involving government and human rights have erupted during the liberal regime take for instance the case of omar khadr travesty 
more creating an antimuslim bias at a canadian university suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere irish human rights activists against freedom of speech this case is something we had known albeit too late to intervene at the time and has been subsequently discredited publicly even during the harper regime  the overwhelming theme was pointed out by then barely  year old omar khadr who said  you dont care about me  this is what defines the mindset of these people bent on extremism over extremism to subdue public conscience
the attack on professor hall was particularly toxic but equally sinister attacks have taken place before some decade ago now defunct canadian islamic congress faced onslaught from all sides based on planted stories and baited manoeuvring it was the largest muslim organization at a time canadian muslims became the largest religious minority one particular episode involved bnai briths planted story involving a university professor who became the target of hate crime while at the same time investigated for hate crime if it wasnt for the humane and civic behaviour of the then university president current governor general david johnston it would have become career threatening if not life threatening event of the professor top university personnel told me in private how the university faced pressure from donors that wanted that professor to disappear from the academic as well as public arena the vendetta of this sort beggars belief even today what we dont know is how many of these assaults on conscience took place and has been brewing
clearly some of the faithful memberssympathizers apply it publicly such was the case of former professor turned politician irwin cotler who routinely infected the political arena with his prejudice and bias imported from the academia then there are others such as alan rock of university of ottawa that implanted manoeuvring of the political arena to the academia a third group would be lorna marsden of york university that abused authority to run a vindictive agenda yet others have found every other way possible to target a person of conscience all the meanwhile covering up all trails so the victim cannot point a finger to the attacker and has no recourse to justice or self defence it doesnt matter which category they belong to they all produce scandals and drag down the good name of the academia while agencies that are supposed to be uphold the rights and dignity of the academia stand by and for some cases join in to the atrocity this obscene attack on human rights and academic decency was once brought to light by late professor david noble who ended up suing york university and canadian jewish congress jointly for conspiring against him professor noble a jew himself faced the vilest of subjugation by organizations claiming to promote the rights of jews that wasnt enough dr noble had to take on human rights commission and other agencies that stood by either in complicity or in collusion with the university authority professor noble passed away before the lawsuit could see a day in court but soon university of ottawa would come in the picture with the infamous involvement of alan rock a man without a phd that was at the helm of the university mr rock recently left the universitybut not before leaving the universitys good name in the sewerage of politicking what dr mahon has done is bring this insidious modus operandi to yet another victim
had i not have the misfortune of being on the wrong side of this modus operandi in the last  years i would almost not understand what is at works here in old days such tactic would be unheardof in a university certainly such things couldnt happen in a civilized country i would exclaim
so what happened to professor hall is not new what is new is the waking up of the general public your letter reverberates the emotion of everyone with conscience that came to know about professor hall people are waking up and are beginning to ask for justice for instance in the context of csis an activist jim comeau wrote i would say its time to jail the highest ranking csis to send a clear message to the rest of them do something illegal straight to prison they damn well knew what they were doing was illegal
the peoples revulsion to such atrocious maligning of people of conscience was summed up in recent letter of julian assange who wrote on us general election day november  
yet some weeks ago in a tactic reminiscent of senator mccarthy and the red scare wikileaks green party candidate stein glenn greenwald and clintons main opponent were painted with a broad red brush the clinton campaign when they were not spreading obvious untruths pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with russia the campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publicationsbecause none exists
in the end those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them  a reason for censorship the first amendment cannot tolerate only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate
of course recent events have allowed us to see this in the highest level of politics in the united states
to anyone with an iota of conscience there is no mystery here people are making their voice clearly known in the words of claire lanyado i prefer unpredictable to criminal and evil the problem is when a president of university for whatever reason decides to use his position to serve the special interest group deliberately there is no recourse for a professor to fight himher in other cases if such atrocity were launched against a student eg the case of freemanmaloy vs lorna marsden of york university  the student an antizionist jew could bring a lawsuit of misfeasance in public office with the help of yet another jewish lawyer peter rosenthal who himself is a university professor of mathematics it was struck down by the court and then it was overruled by the court of appeals at the end the university settled and dr marsden the embattled president was gone the morale of this story is the path to justice is steep but for a professor the path to justice is becoming impossible
the irony is that it is the people harboring so much hate who tell others that they are committing hate crimes just because they dare speak out against an atrocity of course they pick their targets that are perceived as weak and vulnerable and they attack the target only after making sure that the target cannot run to anyone for justice
thats how extremism works

for the last  years i have witnessed and experienced the severe restraints on any free and balanced discussion of the facts this reluctance to criticize any policies of the israeli government is because of the extraordinary lobbying efforts of the americanisrael political action committee and the absence of any significant contrary voices
 former us president jimmy carter 
how the interviews came about
the marxian thesis that the dominant culture and ideology of a society here referred to as social base or just base are those of the dominant class here referred to as system is a sharp tool to probe how political systems work and how they stay in power does this tool work in the us model certainly  the relation between the system and its social base has been regular since the inception of the thirteen colonies because of that sustained regularity system and base acted in convergent patterns of dependency in historical perspective it was not possible for the system to transform those colonies into states and thereafter expand its conquests to form a continental empire without a solid social base that shared its purpose and visions for expansion from that time onward an ideological symbiosis ran between the system and the base not only that but each time the system modifies direction philosophy or ideology the base would adapt by modifying its attitudes and perception
the patterns of ideological association between the us system and its social base extended into modern times and the yardstick to measure them is the presidential elections if you look at voters turnout since   you will notice that a relativetolarge majority of americans had voted in those elections my interpretation of the vote in relation to marxs thesis is the following voting for a system that is known for its aggressive imperialist policies crimes around the world overthrowing foreign governments not in line with washington and countless military interventions and invasions that left millions of people dead means one thing voting for that system while knowing its attributes policies and actions amounts to active sharing in its ideology culture and violence
more zionism is racism zionism goes from bad to worse taking judaism with it how modern is israel green party of canada calls to revoke jewish national fund charitable status caveat that does not necessarily mean that all voters share the systems imperialistic values of violence and destruction of foreign peoples the pertinent meaning of voting interpreted in relation to the systems foreign policy objectives versus the objectives of the base resides in two concepts discarding immediately the notion that the base has been cohabitated by the system the first concept has it that the base has given a mandate to the system to carry out its ideology of empire and imperialism based on the undeclared condition to spare the people from the horrors of foreign wars a dichotomy sets in here the system has its way of life and the base has its own the second concept has to do with the basic tenets of colonialism meaning if the system could be successful to obtain unspecified benefits through wars then the base could share in these benefits despite aversion to violence and opposition to the institution of war as a means to resolve problems between nations
 a question would abstaining from voting resolve the issue of active sharing in the policies of the system this subject is open for debate   
the relation between the american system and its base was uniform up to a certain point in history late s until that point the american state was still busy completing its structural transformation into a big power status that uniformity however managed to keep the patterns of the political power unchanged to be exact despite persistent immigration that should have altered the relations between the base and government as well as the composition of the latter the dominance of the traditional ruling elites was  not open for challenge and  shaped by an exclusive american anglosaxon experience
but when franklyn d roosevelt showed signs of surrender to the zionist pressure on the issue of establishing a jewish state in palestine he opened a large crack in the system that was the first time in us history where the powerful american imperialist state yielded to a foreign ideology that was not part of its basic project with that a movement with a limited religious social base began penetrating the files and ranks of the us power the rest is history as a result the unrelenting entrenchment inside the political structures of the united states coupled with accumulated changes in the configuration of the us power the dominant american system itself fell under the domination of one of its social factionsamerican jewish zionists
when franklyn d roosevelt showed signs of surrender to the zionist pressure on the issue of establishing a jewish state in palestine he opened a large crack in the system
as a group american jewish zionists have all attributes of an independent establishment they possess efficient organizational structures have a monolithic political presence across the american system and they know how to finance their activities with us tax money i must note that their alignment with the global agenda of us imperialism is a twopoint expedient the first is focused on being recognized as earnest operators at the service of americas interests the second is tactical to reap on behalf of israel the benefits of alignment with slogans such as israel is our only trusted ally in the middle east
the american jewish zionist experience is agenda driven as such their domestic and foreign agendas have precedence over any other jewishrelated consideration
on the domestic front the focus could not be more evident to consolidate zionism and turn it into a means to  perpetuate israel as an american national issue and  make of them the principal factor in defining american politics you can notice the endeavor clearly during us elections when the zionist media question whether this or that candidate is good for the jews and for israel today voicing dissent against the policies of american jewish zionism or criticizing israel amounts to crime jimmy carter experienced this firsthand when he published his book palestine peace not apartheid  american jewish zionists unleashed the fire of hell upon him
as for the jewish zionist foreign agenda this is clearcut and leaves no space for misunderstanding it aims to induce control or lead the united states to  adopt hostile policies toward the arab nations because due to their rejection of the zionist state and  undertake military actions against any country that appears as posing a potential or direct threat to israel equally important it demands that the united states keep denying the palestinians rights for nationhood through american diplomacy what is the rationale recognition of the palestinian national rights means the invalidation of the zionist state and its claim on palestine
because the jewish zionist control of the us system is real and dominant how does the american society figure visàvis this dominance based on observations of the american society and its multiple cultural and ideological patterns there can be but one answer zionism is not the dominant culture and ideology of the american people it is however the dominant culture and ideology of the us political system
observations
first despite gargantuan zionist propaganda apparatuses directed to the american people jewish zionists have consistently failed to create interest or sympathy for zionist issues and for israel
second due to historically developed indifference to foreign issues a majority of americans have only vague ideas on what zionism is
third to establish roots for their political dominance jewish zionist activists invariably focus not on the american people but on ways to control the american system from inside by controlling first the institutions that matter white house and congress
fourth this control did not happen because of elections it is preponderantly due to the practice of appointing jewish zionists to important positions inside the administrations
fifth among the stratagems employed by zionists when they run for elective offices one was particularly effective take advantage of the reverence of the population for the idea of election to do that jewish zionist candidates rarely if ever talk about israel or zionism instead they only debate matters of interest to the voters once elected though promoting israel via american legislations becomes the top hidden agenda
sixth and to conclude this particular argument the fact that one administration after another succumbed to the diktat of jewish zionists thus indirectly to israel in matters of foreign policy and wars proves that the culture and praxis of those administrations are those of the dominant ideology and culturezionism
another point to discuss is the expansion of the jewish zionist power by all accounts such an expansion is not a phenomenon but an incremental process in his book the arabists the romance of an american elite  robert d kaplan defined the issue that i framed as a process in terms of gradual replacement of traditional diplomatic elites with new ideological elites that had no interest in the ways of the old school of diplomacy kaplan was unambiguous he called these new elites by their names irishamericans and jewishamericans
kaplans viewpoint on this replacement is important to our discussion he argued that the old elites approached the usarab relations with an open mind and readiness for dialog all while keeping an eye on the us imperialist interests his argument opens the door for a veritable conclusion the two groups of postwwii american society that kaplan mentioned had in fact changed the dynamics of us foreign policy it is public knowledge that both groups are known for their hostility toward arabs and muslimseach for his own set of religious political and ideological rationales as for the successive shares of africanamericans and hispanics in the making of the national policy of the united states this is another argument
as a witness to history in early  i began drafting a comprehensive analysis on the role of american jewish zionists in the making of us policies and wars in the arab world in may of that year as my work became broad in scope i decided to seek more views on the subject i came up with the idea to conduct several interviews where i pose the same questions while some of the prospective interviewees declined and others accepted but then withdrew three prominent thinkers acclaimed for their knowledge scholarship and outstanding political activism graciously gave me their views
they are francis boyle a professor of international law university of illinois college of law james petras a professor emeritus university of binghamton new york canadian writer and former coeditor of the online publication of dissident voice kim petersen professors boyle and petras answered my questions via phone conversations and petersen via email correspondence
however in the weeks following the interviews my work swelled up to such a length that it became unsuitable for internet publishing in short i was unable to honor my commitment to publish the interviews as planned today as i thank prof francis boyle prof james petras and kim petersen for sharing their invaluable insight i apologize to them for the delay in putting the interviews out there to read
introduction
the turning point in the emergence of jewish zionism as a dominant american political force came about when iraq invaded kuwait discussing the origins and strategic complications of that invasion goes beyond the scope of this introduction the jewish zionist establishment seized the occasion mobilized its omnipresent propaganda operatives and led colossal media campaigns to promote military actions against iraq to bring their war mania to fruition they unleashed their experts in all directions they talked about iraqs formidable military capabilities and about saddams onemillionman standing army ready to invade saudi arabia and seize its oil they told stories about saddam husseins personal life his bunkers and his mortal nuclear threats to israel and they talked about iraqs threats to us interests and allies in the middle east    here is a brief account of those events
on july   iraqi president saddam hussein met with us ambassador to iraq april glaspie it is on record that glaspie gave hussein an unambiguous but indirect greenlight to resolve iraqs problems with kuwait militarily on august  iraq invaded kuwait on august  george h w bush ordered the freezing of iraqi and kuwaiti assets and immediately placed iraq under hermetic embargo considering the prompt extraordinary antiiraq measures that the united states took in the first  hours of that invasion one wonders what was pushing the us to move so quickly on iraq knowing that only two days earlier this was conducting a us proxy against iran the observation that the us did not take similar actions when iraq invaded iran in  or when israel invaded lebanon in  raises many questions what were the us rationales in taking such measures who conceived them did the us entrap iraq why   
the atmosphere that followed the invasion was surrealistic like a lightning bolt us imperialist and zionist forces instantly mobilized their media talking heads retired generals and bogus experts on the middle east the deafening uproar they made and all lies they told about atrocities committed by iraq in kuwait hid a definite scheme incite for war  in the period august    january   israelis and jewish zionists from all fields appeared en mass and in every possible medium available to urge the bush regime to give up diplomacy in favor of war on january   a member coalition in which the us had the lion shareninetyseven percent of the total forceattacked iraq by every standard and minutia of details the war on iraq in  was an american war 
at the end of a war that destroyed one of israels arab adversaries george h w bush might have thought of himself as americas laureate hero he did not predict though that his temporary freezing of the us loan guaranties to israel would have unleashed the jewish zionist establishment against him the fact that he lost to bill clinton who opposed bushs freeze and who stated that israel was the only country that paid back its debts indicated that american jewish zionists had finally reached their objective to perfect ways to control the us politics from the inside  in retrospect it can be said that george h w bush was the last nonzionist american president from bill clinton forward us presidents and their vice president became pawns in the jewish zionist play of power
now as the united states was preparing for war with iraq to liberate kuwait thousands of antiwar activists and intellectuals from a wide spectrum of political convictions spoke loudly against it but no one could have ever beaten patrick j buchanans memorable words about how american jewish zionists and israel were pushing for that war he said there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the middle east  the israeli defense ministry and its amen corner   with that buchanan hit the proverbial nail on the head am rosenthal a ringleader of us zionist journalism could not bear what he heard in a rebuttal he unleashed an acerbic attack against buchanan his weapon of argument so to speak was the stale and trite accusation of antisemitism
whining rosenthal twisted buchanans clear words and went on to imply that buchanan was in effect engaging in an antijewish tirade he reinterpreted buchanans words and cast them in a standard zionistic fashion he wrote that buchanans intention was the jews are trying to drag us into war only jews want war israeli jews want war to save israels hide american jews who talk of military action against iraq want war because it would suit israeli interests they are willing to spill american blood for israeli interests 
by inserting the word jew in his reply rosenthal and the new york times behind him spat on the face of us political reality under the tight grip of zionism we need not waste our breath on rosenthals petty tactic his clear objective was to distract from the central issue which is buchanans opposition to the planned war against iraq was unrelated to the religious denomination of those who were promoting it rather he was unmistakably referring to their political identity
still buchanan was honest he pointed the finger to israel and its amen corner because that was the truth the fact that most israelis and amen corners happened to be of jewish faith was nonissue to conclude it is evident that buchanan a dreamer of an american republic not empire could not stand by idle while seeing the united states sheepishly fastened to the yoke of zionism and gutlessly prostrating before a tiny settler state israel
buchanan did not stop there truthful and resolute he dared to describe in categorical terms the pitiful condition of the us congress visàvis israel and american jewish zionists he dubbed it as an israelioccupied territory  buchanan powerfully hit the target in such a way that countless cowardly american politicians would dare not think let alone say notice that buchanan had placed israel before its us amen corner i view this as a statement he clearly implied that israel is the primary decision maker did that also imply that us zionist groups amen corner are puppets moved by israel most likely if so which has more power in setting the us world agenda and policies israel or american jewish zionists dialectically the answer should be israel by means of its amen corner
now in december  jim lehrer a former coanchor of the macneillehrer newshour and later sole anchor of the newshour with jim lehrer  interviewed pat buchanan it is important to mention that jim lehrer has monopolized a significant position funded by federal tax money for over  years starting in  is that an issue yes and to debate it the following applies whenever a specific group of people be they christian muslim jewish atheist duopoly party apparatchiks etc keeps an important public post for such a long duration the implication is unescapable the group controls that post because of its embedded importance    but more important they have the power to keep it
nonetheless when a specific group continues to hold throughout time important positions inside public corporations agencies and branches of the us government a paradigm emerges either the group controls said corporations directlythat is why it is able to do what they want or it controls them indirectly by controlling first who appoints the board of trustees and sets corporate policies and appointees at any rate considering this type of control the assumption that such group has power over the government and its public corporations is reasonable
additionally the issue of monopoly of news is critical in another respect it means that someone within the context of us imperialism has decided that the us public discourse must conform to predetermined patterns in these patterns issues such as israel zionism palestine us imperialism in the middle east wars etc are designed to move only on linear grounds without ever touching the core of the matter
before continuing i must state that lehrers political views are not a subject to discuss visàvis his program for one the newshour program is not about the personal views of presentersit is about information prepared for the public from a public corporation second whether lehrer had sympathies for israel or zionism is nonissue because most viewers expect neutral discussions regardless of who delivers them nevertheless a situation such as this has a consequence affecting the special relations between the narrated newscomments the people who deliver them and the people who hear them
firstly planning news delivery to attain specific results is a good technique for those in the business of indoctrination psychology and perception are the areas of expertise that news planners depend on to disseminate certain news and analyses to be sure these planners know that most viewers have no special or personal stakes on events happening in other countries still the immediate consequence that controlled news and commentaries could generate is easy to predict they also know they can seep to the viewers preconceived ideas through pleasant dialogs affable manners appearance of neutrality and clever circumlocutions
to be fair to lehrer he was consistent in making intelligent questions however he was also consistent at doing something else he would calibrate his questions in such a way as not to reveal new truths or solicit critical replies that could go beyond boundaries deliberately conceived so as not to be crossed it is pragmatic to say that the observance of these boundaries would nicely serve the zionist and imperialist discourse in essence a practice thusly followed is a preemptive mechanism of control cloaked as a professional presentation
now in his interview lehrer played dumb when he asked buchanan about his bold characterization of the congress he phrased his question as follows you have also said that congress is an israelioccupied territory now what do you mean by that  italics are mine
comment semantically as much as politically buchanans figure of speech was terse and unequivocal he plainly meant that the congress observes israels agenda and acts accordingly there was no need for buchanan to say anything further because what he said had and still has basis in verifiable facts with a question such as what do you mean by that lehrer was not seeking a rational reply from buchanan the form and content of the question had the objective of wanting to entrap buchanan make him retract or at least contradict himself to show inconsistency in essence lehrer had simply tried to deny that israel controls the congress through its amen corner because his what do you mean indicated astonishment rather than request for explanation 
to wrap up the issue without exclusion any denial of the jewish zionist control of the united states is a farce take abraham h foxman of the infamous antidefamation league as an example foxman authored a masterdeceptive propaganda book that he called  the deadliest lies  the israeli lobby and the myth of jewish control italics are mine first foxman lied he knew very well that the jewish zionist control is not a myth but a pervasive reality second but most important the problem is not the abstract jewish control but the specificjewish zionist control this can be explained using a current universal truth hundreds of thousands of jews from all nationalities actively oppose zionism on political religious ethical historical and ideological grounds
foxmans denial means one of two things either he is a parochial charlatan when the subject is the undisputed power of american jewish zionism or he is very ignorant of the history of zionism  which is impossible either way foxmans business is propaganda demagogy and deception incidentally foxmans denial looks very similar to what some arabs do in the middle east villagersbut even some city folkstry to fend off envy by following an eonold superstition they fix a drawing on a wall in their shops or homes showing the palm of an open hand with an open eye in its center it appears that foxman and his associates have their own superstition by decrying the deadliest lies against american jewish zionists they try to fend off the accusation or the envy that jewsspecifically jewish zionistshave power and influence
of substance did foxman not learn or did anyone inform him about what john foster dulles told william knowland a prozionist senator from california back in february  in an exchange about the proposed sanctions to get israel out of egyptian territory occupied by israel in the suez war dulles pronounced these prophetic words we cannot have all our policies made in jerusalem     that was in  today all those who deride or deny the charge that israel has a say on us foreign policy and wars in the middle east must prove that those who are making this charge are misinformed or just lying
interestingly years after buchanan made that statement the successive events proved his sharp assessment and political perspicacity two people vindicated his characterization of capitol hills as an israelioccupied territory and both used his words to make the point the first is a former cia officer philip giraldi and the second is philip weiss founder of mondoweiss website in an article he wrote in  giraldi pointed to the congress as  its still occupied territory  weiss titled a piece he wrote in  as such  capitol hill  still israelioccupied territory 
at this point do american jewish zionists control the united states do they control it as polity or only the political system do they have real influence in setting us foreign policy and wars against the arab and muslim nations or maybe all this talk is no more than baseless allegations

i grew up in a working class family and have experienced the deep racism of a society that views vietnamese americans as the targets of war ive lived through successive democratic party administrations with little to celebrate the bill clinton era brought nafta which outsourced my aunts union job and forced her into the lowwage service sector my mother never found a living wage job and relied on my fathers public sector union position to meet our familys needs in the st century obama expanded bushs war on terror which merged my fathers job with into the department of homeland security
downward pressure on wages and working conditions forced my father to refinance our home multiple times to pay college expenses for my sister and i even then my sister and i graduated with large sums of student debt i have worked four jobs in three years and only one has paid a truly living wage another four years of a democratic party president was not going to make anything better for my family that is not to say that donald trump was the answer to the structural problems of exploitation but trumps victory is not the end of the world either
trumps victory is the product of global capitalisms decay millions of people voted for trump for a variety of reasons namely because he clearly labeled problems and outlined solutions to them i dont agree with all of his solutions white nationalism stains his domestic and international agenda trumps call to further militarize the usmexico border yet make peace with russia is a contradiction in and of itself a white nationalist billionaire who speaks the language of racism on the one hand and the interests of peace on the other is not exactly a model of consistency
however trumps consistency is not the most important aspect of this election millions of people have shown their disgust with the twoparty system of the capitalist class a number of mostly white workers and whites from the petty business class voted for trump trump also received more votes than expected from the black and latino electorate meanwhile the elections produced a low turnout for clinton from the historic democratic party bases of black voters latino voters and women voters clinton may have won the electoral vote but the balance of forces ensured the ruling class would gamble on trump trumps base of white workers and petty business elites angered by thirty years of monopoly capitalist assault are more of a threat at the moment than the millions of democratic party voters who are now without a home the round table of elites called the electoral college could not afford any more damage to the democratic party than what transpired during the election
so the democratic party is now on its deathbed and there is only one class of people willing to resurrect it white liberals a large section of the democratic party base wanted bernie sanders to be their next president they did not hold their nose for clinton the legitimate concerns that immigrants and oppressed people possess with trumps racism should not be led into the bowels of the democratic party yet for white liberals this is the ultimate mission
more brian cloughley the greatest achievement of mr trump would be engage in positive discussions with russia and china arise president trump or why its not the end of the world as we know it trumps sexual predator characteristics  his grandfather was a pimp but at least he paid the women he hired the significance of the gops attempted purge of donald trump trumps victory has energized the white liberal section of the united states to fight back white liberals began the process in a deep state of mourning over clintons loss they then placed blame for trumps victory on russia lowvoter turnout and the white working class white liberals have blamed everyone except hillary clinton and the democratic party now white liberals in the us hope to wage a crusade against trump in hopes of a democratic party recovery it is all too clear that their primary intention is to get ahead of the genuine forces that rejected both trump and clinton and lead them into the democratic party graveyard
white liberals love to hide their own racism and ruling class sensibilities through a process of appeal and betrayal they speak with the authority of moral righteousness on the one hand and the knife of oppression on the other they talk down to the struggle of peoples oppressed by white supremacy and attempt to steer it in a way that benefits their class interests white liberals despise the working class because they understand that there will come a day when it destroys the system that they profit so handsomely from
white liberals usually originate from the ruling class the managerial class and various stripes of the professionalized sector their class has ordained themselves the true leaders of human rights based on race gender and sexual equality however white liberals speak of human rights on the basis of a complete abandonment of the material struggle for liberation in other words the white liberal is the ultimate counterrevolutionary force in us society it has wielded the socalled struggle for human rights as a weapon to prevent the emergence of classconsciousness among the oppressed and its genuine leaders
the  elections have shown that the broad class arrangement of white liberals is indeed in crisis and only has itself to blame white liberals cannot acknowledge that it was their brand of politics that led to the trump moment their dominance over the left in the us ensured that no organized force existed strong enough to challenge the ills of capitalist decline millions of people voted for sanders based on his demands for material relief millions of people voted for trump for the similar reasons his racism and sexism notwithstanding whatever racism and sexism existed in his rhetoric could not trump the fact that the trade deals and wars he spoke out against in part drove ordinary people to vote for him if the trump base wanted racism and sexism primarily they would of voted for ted cruz or jeb bush in the primaries
so white liberal anger about trumps victory is not directed at sexism racism or any other aspect of trumps politics white liberals are afraid of the sharpening contradictions of us society that threaten to squeeze them out of their privileged position under the racist and capitalist order millions of people are now asking where white liberalism was during the massive loss in working class income and wealth that occurred over the last forty years where were the white liberals during the endless wars that have been waged even more fervently by democratic party administrations where were the white liberals during the erection of the largest police and prison state in the world the institutions that murder and incarcerate black americans in record numbers and deport undocumented peoples at historic rates
the answer is that white liberals were supporting the us capitalist systems assault on the oppressed every step of the way this is what they are trying to hide with their anger over trump we cannot defeat trumps white nationalism if the white liberal is not defeated with just as much vigor white liberal ideology has a history of infecting social movements as it spreads it breeds the germs of democratic party control over these movements but the democratic party made its own bed by acting as the more effective evil of the ruling class if a powerful movement of the working class is to emerge in the age of trump then we must fight hard against the white liberal forces working hard to resuscitate the democratic party and build an independent party of our own",2016-11-11

china has warned donald trump that he will be defying the wishes of the entire planet if he acts on his vow to back away from the paris climate agreement after he becomes us president next january
the election of climate change skeptic donald trump as president is likely to end the us leadership role in the international fight against global warming and may lead to the emergence of a new and unlikely champion china
it is global societys will that all want to cooperate to combat climate change a senior beijing negotiator said in morocco on friday at the first round of un talks since the paris deal was sealed last december the chinese negotiators added that any movement by the new us government would not affect their transition towards becoming a greener economy
china worked closely with the administration of outgoing president barack obama to build momentum ahead of the  paris agreement on climate change the partnership of the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters helped get nearly  countries to support the pact at the historic meet in frances capital
by contrast trump has called global warming a hoax created by china to give it an economic advantage and said he plans to remove the united states from the historic climate agreement as well as reverse many of obamas measures to combat climate change
more canadian big media ignoring responsibility by failing to cover climate change crisis petition calls for doj investigation into exxonmobils denial of climate science zou ji deputy director of the national centre for climate change strategy and a senior chinese climate talks negotiator told reuters that if trump abandons efforts to implement the paris agreement chinas influence and voice are likely to increase in global climate governance which will then spill over into other areas of global governance and increase chinas global standing power and leadership
china is expected to play a pivotal role in consolidating and enhancing southsouth partnership particularly when it comes to issues related to climate change
china is steadily ramping up efforts to assist other developing countries in addressing climate change a gesture that has received wide welcome
speaking to the chinese news agency xinhua moroccan foreign minister and climate change conference cop president salaheddine mezouar said that china has an extremely important role to play in accompanying reinforcing and boosting southsouth partnership and support sustainable development policies in the african continent
xie ji deputy chief of the chinese delegation to the ongoing nd session of the conference of the parties cop  said on nov  that china has ironed out a concrete program to help other developing countries to become more climateresilient we will help build up ten lowcarbon pilot zones launch  climate change mitigation and adaptation projects and offer training programs for  climaterelated professionals he said
what xie called the  project is part of the effort that china has made in recent years to help other developing countries fight against climate change the country has earmarked a total of  million yuan about us million since  to help developing countries according to zhang yucheng deputy director of the international cooperation division of the department of climate change of the national development and reform commission ndrc

book review  dr rafiq islam emertec rd ltd dalhousie university halifax nova scotia
 book title true islam jihad and terrorism the science of islamic foreign policy  jaan s islam
 publisher new york nova science publishers
 isbn 
 at a time of politics of fear jaan islam counters fear with knowledge in his masterpiece true islam jihad and terrorism nova science publishers new york  during the  us election it has become clear world peace and security is connected to the state of islam and how it is understood in todays context this is a very timely book that fills a gap in the western society about islamic history philosophy and political science this book presents the islamic political philosophy as represented in the writings of great muslim thinkers and scholars such as ibn khaldun jaan islam uses the socalled islamic cognition technique and starts the book with a chapter dedicated to islamic cognition this chapter on cognition itself is a paradigm shift in the modern research scholarship and can be considered for advancing knowledge in other fields such an extension was first pointed by islam zatzman and islam  in their groundbreaking work on educational curriculum
more stop using millenary religions as a scapegoat for the crimes of modern imperialism another ramadan for muslims amid sufferings a conversation on equality integration and islam as a religious marker an open letter to young muslims everywhere the seed of triumph in every adversity following the tradition of early islamic scholars jaan islam presented all theories in the book with evidence from the primary islamic sources quran and authenticated traditions of the prophet  these sources were completely ignored in the in the orientalist now it has morphed into neoorientalism writings which led to the inundation of the post  world with disinformation and agendadriven research about islamic history the distinction between this book and these agendadriven ones gives the book a special value
 although the book explains the islamic foundations of political science and governance it should not be looked at as a book of theology it is a dogmafree approach that has been characterized as truly scientific elsewhere  quite appropriately the author starts off with a brilliant narration of islamic cognition it has been all but forgotten in the west that islam is the religion that started the tradition of dogmafree truly scientific cognition the west does recognize averröes the famous islamic scholar as the father of secular philosophy whereas brands islam as just another religion similar to christianity infected with doctrinal philosophy it is no surprise that with that starting point islam remains the most misunderstood religion in the west
chapter  of the book deals with fundamental philosophies of three major philosophers namely hobbes locke and ibn khaldun in this chapter the author debunks another myth that is ibn khalduns political theory is somehow similar to those of hobbes and locke ibn khaldun the father of social science indeed had a very different starting point in his cognition the author points out how ibn khalduns first premise was shahadah that formed the basis of the cognition axis by using quran as the origin and prophet muhammads life through the book of hadith as the pivotal point one the other hand locke had placed himself as the pivotal point whereas hobbes eliminated any cognition point the author makes it clear that both hobbes and lockes cognition tools are just as illogical as dogmatic cognition in my researched opinion this accurate distinction has not been made by any other author on the topic it is because the eastern authors do not know about hobbes and locke and the western authors do not know about islamic cognition that was obviously alive and well with ibn khaldun
in chapter  the author uses the case laws of the prophet and his four rightly guided caliphs known as rashedun caliphs clearly the authors intention is to understand how the prophet and his closest followers went to war or which verses of the quran they were enacting for the first time anyone took this approach and not surprisingly the author comes up with four rigid criteria from the quran no other author to the best of my knowledge connected them to specific wars that the prophet and his companions engaged in this finding helps the author establish jus ad bellum that can explain every war that shaped the foundation of the young islamic state of the time
similar to chapter  the author discovers jus ad bello in islamic jurisprudence in chapter  once again the case laws are presented and analyzed in such a manner one can take any new example and evaluate it to call it permissible or not the theoretical basis for critiquing any modern warfare is set in this chapter
in chapter  the author addresses a difficult topic when is it allowed or even mandatory to rebel against a head of state it is often stated that islam is a complete code of life the author makes it clear that islam didnt leave anything to imagination and has left a strict criterion and modus operandi for any imaginable crisis that can occur at any time the important question arises as to when a head of state that once claimed to have divine authority can be removed or when a head of state can be declared unfit and it becomes mandatory for the citizens to remove him or wage war if necessary this is not an easy topic to cover even in todays world the author covers it with dexterity from an epoch he considers as exemplary the history is not pretty and there is room for controversy as often the history is written by the victor and clearly after the demise of the rightly guided caliphate the victors were no longer rightly guided the author weaves through this difficult process and makes it clear for the readership this chapter can be an eye opener even for a student of islam that has spent lifetime on the topic
often when islamic criteria are discussed eyes roll and eye brows furrow in disbelief if it is all that simple why dont islamic scholars have consensus the author handles this topic like a pro in chapter  he analyzes current islamic scholars and deconstructs their thought process he has kind words for some but has nothing but scorn for the selfrighteous apologist scholars that have done great disservice to islam andor scientific cognition process one doesnt have to be personal but the writing is so clear one can hardly afford to not get angry at certain genre of scholars to anyones surprise this list is not made out of antiislamic nonmuslim scholars
chapter  is where proof of the pudding appears the author analyzes every major event of todays political arena and analyzes it with the islamic criteria of both jus ad bello and jus ad bellum the author comes up with an index to rank various countries and groups most interesting is the discussion on current us allies such as saudi arabia and how they rank among the biggest offenders of islam and islamic laws this is not a topic for the faint of heart but the author did an excellent job making it easily readable punctuated with numerous riveting arguments
chapter  is the conclusion and recommendation i have studied islam for some  years and yet i found these conclusions novel and entirely logical i doubt anyone would agree with the conclusions unless of course that person reads the entire book prior to reading the conclusion it is important to read the book in sequence
chapter  lists the bibliography and references it is many pages long and is quite comprehensive
chapter  is the appendix that lists the letters of the prophet it is a great idea to give the letters in original arabic so there is no room for misinterpretation let alone disinformation
anyone with knowledge of islam knows that jihad is in the core of islam and this book shows it is so and there needs to be no apology quite interestingly the author even depicts jihad as the roof of islam without the roof the fort of islam has no protection whatsoever this depiction captures the essence of protection security as well as integrity and puts away the notion of jihad being a weapon for crusade like aggression
this book belongs to the desk of any researcher interested in knowing about islam or what islam can do to bring about peace on earth in order to live out the true meaning of the word islam that means peace through submission to the creator this book is equally useful for anyone interested in pursuit of peace and harmony that is truly elusive in todays world in this sense this book is a manual for world governance in peace",2016-11-14
314,china warns trump against abandoning climate change deal increases climate change aid to developing countries to  b," shares
   
citizens of the united states have chosen the wealthy businessman donald trump as their new president trump who was considered a wild card candidate will take control of the country in january to fill his four year term violent protests are raging and attacks against those who oppose trump or fail to fit his criteria of acceptability are on the rise trump supporters have also been attacked to say the very least this is the dawning of a new age in america to put it mildly trump alienated huge swaths of humanity during his campaign women mexicans muslims blacks the media have all taken their turns at his whipping pole trumps harsh words have been used to condemn huge groups the only people trump hasnt attacked are white american males
the only people trump hasnt attacked are white american males
interestingly trump shares many traits with the man who brought germany to its knees during wwii adolph hitler hitler rallied germans by directing national anger toward two primary groups the communists and the jews trump rallied americans by directing high doses of anger toward mexico and muslims trumps perception of mexican immigrants is way off the mark as the majority of those who emigrate to the us are hard working people willing to perform roles most white americans avoid like field harvesting nonetheless trump has described them as rapists and criminals tossing a blanket over every human being who finds their way to the us through illegal means
when it comes to muslims mr trump is exceptionally ignorant he fulfills the thoughts of those in the middle east who already believe the us has a long range plan to eliminate islam
millions of americans are having a meltdown over the election of trump while those who supported his bid for presidency continue to express anger and simultaneously imitate trumps bully demeanor by attacking those who disagree with their point of view particularly in social media insults have never been so foul and widespread everyone is riled people are unsure of what to do it seems almost certain that things are going to get a lot worse before they could ever get better
more defeating white liberalism in the age of trump brian cloughley the greatest achievement of mr trump would be engage in positive discussions with russia and china arise president trump or why its not the end of the world as we know it trumps sexual predator characteristics  his grandfather was a pimp but at least he paid the women he hired on a positive note trump has backed off on his threat to dismantle obamacare one thing is certain donald trump is extremely willing to toss out ideas and positions and then change his mind the following day unfortunately trump did this when initially exposing the connection between barack obama and hillary clinton and isis
it is an absolute fact that the united states was directly responsible for starting two more wars in the middle east in syria and libya both conflicts were deadly and destabilizing and waged at the request of israel as a wikileaks cable recently confirmed the mere idea that nations are trampled this way cements our understanding of how obama and clinton operate it also speaks volumes about the dark ways that the us has been manipulated by the zionist government of israel a nation that drains us taxpayers of more than  million a day the track record of human rights violations in israel goes well beyond unforgivable
the isis expose was a golden moment for trump even though he didnt stick to his guns the wars the us has been waging in recent years are all unjustified conflicts used to make large amounts of money for groups like halliburton and mercenary organizations while the us government spends trillions on killing it has historically ignored the suffering its allies direct toward their own citizens one great example is saudi arabia the radical wahhabi government that still beheads people in public in strict violation of international lawthese problems have sullied us support for many years
the only hope for the future lies in peace and reconciliation for clinton maintaining peace was a seemingly impossible task lest we forget it was her threats of war toward russia and iran that crossed the line for large numbers of americans parading as a liberal hillary clintons warmongering is legendary the democratic national committee debacle that derailed the only promising candidate bernie sanders was equally reprehensible
in the end there were no good choices for us voters the protrump crowd may not feel as victorious once they realize that mr trump does not care about them in any way shape or form only days after the election it is already being announced that the tax cuts trump promised will only be a fraction of what he claimed it is reminiscent of former us president george bushs famous words read my lips no new taxes of course each man offered the promise as an election gimmick each time it was enough to convince republicans trump is here to promote his own needs and to meet his own goals perhaps some of his political moves will coincide with the wishes of his voters perhaps not
in the meanwhile tempers are flaring and americans are increasingly turning against each other the real unavoidable truth is that donald trump will be the next us president he says he is going to make america great again and many of us wonder exactly what that means in the postwwii years there was peace unless you were black americans had freedom unless they were women or minorities
the united states has always waged illegal wars dating back to the very beginning when one treaty with native people after another was broken is donald trump going to keep the us out of wars for the next four years it would be a very good thing if he did
on one hand it seems entirely doubtful that the country will make it through four years of donald trump but giving up is not the answer if trump goes too far out of sync or becomes embroiled in charges that he cant pay off or threaten away there is an impeachment process that americans can follow",2016-11-14

halls suspension reminds me of the famous cases of two american academics steven salaita and norman finkelstein both were openly critical of zionism and spoke against the marginalization and persecution of the indigenous arab populations of the occupied territories both were ostracized publicly for their vocal support of palestinian rights and lost their jobs

trumps victory was a shock to most especially given the broad support hillary clinton received from the forces of wall street although trump is a billionaire himself his criticism of free trade agreements and us policy toward russia angered a broad section of the ruling class it is the ruling class in control of the banks military institutions and corporate boardrooms that usually determine elections in the united states trumps victory is a product of the ruling systems decline and crisis more than anything else the question is now what
what is urgently needed is a deep investigation of all aspects and contradictions of the trump moment first trump won because the capitalist system is in crisis the laws of the system have inevitably led to such a level of concentration that profit accumulation has turned into its opposite technological innovation has permanently replaced a large section of labor in the us creating the deindustrialized terrain trump spoke so much about in his campaign at the end of the day the profits that wall street speculated into the ground ultimately came from the compulsion to increase buying power with large debt schemes that could never be paid back by a working class whose wages have been in decline for over three decades 
so when hillary clinton decided to campaign as some sort of united front against fascism few listened many people in the us saw clinton as an extension of the ruling establishment that had pummeled working class people into the ground the black lives matter movement exposed her complicity in the crime legislation that led to the vast expansion of the black prisoner population during her husbands rule hillary clinton then made the mistake of coalescing with the ruling establishments of both parties in hopes of isolating trump when in fact she merely exposed her role as a loyal servant of power
some have claimed that since clinton won the popular vote she was the rightful winner regardless of her flaws others have argued that the republican party rightwing elites rigged the election  however true there will be no recall this time around why the dnc and the clinton campaign rigged the primaries in order to defeat sanders in a stunning shift of political legitimacy the democratic party has eviscerated all difference between itself and its republican party counterparts
numerous pieces have been written about the dangers of the cabinet trump will select indeed trumps possibilities do not deviate from the standard republican party makeup his potential choices for top positions include tough on crime rudy giuliani austerity magnate chris christie and privatization enthusiast newt gingrich however for the first time in a long time the president of the united states is accountable to something other than the ruling class in the past republican party and democratic party presidents dutifully served its paymasters while using manipulation to ensure that their respective bases were effectively neutralized
more defeating white liberalism in the age of trump brian cloughley the greatest achievement of mr trump would be engage in positive discussions with russia and china arise president trump or why its not the end of the world as we know it this is not the case with trump just a month ago trump was the least desired choice of the ruling class  it was trumps petty bourgeois and working class base of white america that propelled him to victory it is clear that the need to politically survive in hostile waters will compel trump to choose a neocon administration but a neocon agenda is exactly what his supporters voted against even those who directly or indirectly ascribe to white american nationalism are sick of endless war and austerity however nothing less can be expected from the likes of chris christie and newt gingrich
the contradictions of the trump era will breed a social confrontation between classes not seen since the great depression white liberals and white nationalists will battle for the soul of the twoparty system the neocon establishment will have to confront trumps foreign and economic policy campaign rhetoric much of which is in direct antagonism with the gops record and the democratic party will attempt to use the age of trump as a time to regroup and steer the forces of resistance back into its camp
how should the forces of resistance position themselves under this new set of conditions first the antiwar left needs to confront trumps foreign policy head on and place pressure on him to make good on his promises to scale back nato and its escalation toward russia the left needs to resist any and all attempts by trump to make good on some of his less savory proposals such as a the deportation of the million immigrants and the expansion of the us nuclear arsenal of course trumps rhetoric must be placed in its proper context it was the obama administration that signed a one trillion dollar agreement to modernize the us nuclear arsenal and deported nearly three million immigrants in eight years a number unseen in us history this means resistance to the trump administrations use of the apparatus that obama and the democrats built should be directed at the entire ruling class not just one of the two parties that represent it
the vast majority of people simply cannot afford the resurrection of the twoparty system as don debar of cpr news has made clear the check of white supremacy simply doesnt pay the same dividends anymore while the wealth gap between white america and black american would take over two centuries to even out  it is also true that merely ten percent white america owns almost all wealth in the us  capitalisms crisis has forced a large segment of the population to live under working class conditions a unique opportunity exists to build and strengthen a radical left agenda in the us and a start a discussion of what it will take to implement it
what is meant by opportunity is that a narrow outlook on this moment will breed narrow results it should be imperative that the left force trumps hand on foreign policy it should demand that trump use his executive powers to force through a st century glasssteagall act and create a federal jobs program to rebuild infrastructure in the us the left should not hesitate to condemn and protest whatever white supremacist and repressive policies come out of his administration with full recognition that it was democratic and republican party consensus that got us here as emotions run high and fear captures a number of people completely disenchanted with the current political climate in the united states the time has come to spend the time and effort necessary to prepare the people for the war that existed long before trump class war",2016-11-16

democracy grants people the right to protest to show their opinion on matters that affect their lives and their nations protesting is a universally acknowledged fact belonging to the modern world it serves to give voice to those who are disturbed by the faulty policies drawbacks and negligence of their governments and who wish to raise public awareness on these matters demonstrations rallies strikes pickets boycotts and so on are all ways of protesting as long as they are within the limits defined by the law protests and acts of similar nature are in essence an indisputable part of democracy freedom of opinion and expression
however in some cases protesting is exploited and used as a means of opposing democracy itself protests that give way to riots are now methods of staging coups to shut down administrations and overthrow democratically elected governments
legitimacy of protests and feasibility of demands
democratic protests are welcomed by societies and addressed by governments to the extent that their demands are tangible justified and feasible  protests lacking those qualities are most likely to fail in having their demands met
the antigovernment movement in bulgaria in  confirmed the validity of these qualities the protests took place in three separate cycles january and february witnessed rallies that objected to the high prices of electricity and demanded the government resign they were successful as the requests were sensible a later demonstration was against a government officer and resulted in his resignation yet another cycle of protests called for a change of the system along with some other illegal demands and faced defeat after turning into riots that were not supported by the overall society
more gruesome video shows turkish soldiers execute female kurdish pkk fighters by shooting in their heads  bombers stopped by police blew themselves up in turkey dispute over kurds and coup attempt threatens usturkey alliance the attempted coup détat made turkey band together the gezi park protests in turkey in the same year followed the same pattern set in motion with a good willed and environmentalist approach it was likely to succeed considering its solid and feasible calls and legitimate ways at first the government heeded the nature lovers voices and took a positive step by postponing a construction project that required the destruction of gezi park yet the humanist approach of young people changed course in the wake of provocations of separatist and terrorist gangs and turned into a totally different nature demonstrations that began in gezi park in istanbul and that demanded the preservation of gezi park as a recreational area spread to other cities of the country and transformed into armed and bloody uprising imposing the fall of government it was a quite clear coup detat attempt that did not refrain from using violent methods and openly rejected the validity of a democratically elected government the protests were contradictory considering people took to streets using their democratic rights but then appealed to nondemocratic methods to lay their claims ignoring the will of the nation
though justified at the beginning these two cases of protests demonstrate that they are open to hostile manipulations and may lose their legitimacy if left at the hands of illminded people recently some dark powers have been using this latest technique to manage countries internal affairs as they see fit and stage coups to overthrow governments they bring in professional teams of brutal killers amidst peaceful protests which then lead to violent antidemocratic clashes these protests sometimes end up in civil wars where fellows of the same nation kill one another it all happens in the wake of a governments nonyielding to some dark powers demands and a democratically elected government faces antidemocratic attempts
methods of provocations and otpor
such dramatic outcomes come by the employment of social media social media becomes an instrument for organizing stirring and agitating the masses that are presumed to join the demonstrations various provocative organizations undertake the organization of some agents and provocateurs who take part in demonstrations by inciting them to get violent these illegal subcontractors organize the public relations part of the riots and channel intellectual circles of the country such as its authors academicians journalists and members of nongovernmental institutions to act against democratically elected government in the name of democracy and to lead the public
one of the most common groups among these  professional revolutionary organizations  is a serbiabased resistance organizationotpor  independent observers state that otpor organizes coup attempts and civil disturbance by providing training and logistic support for the usbacked dissident organizations in many countries such as the former yugoslavia serbia georgia bulgaria ukraine egypt brazil and turkey there is a consensus that the cia has been creating riots and social disturbances in fifty countries otpor its offshoot canvas
a relevant source puts forward the following interesting findings otpor 
the otpor s  fistlogo would turn up  years later in the streets of cairo  illustrating further the preposterous foreignbacked nature of the egyptian uprisings serbias otpor would continue receiving funds from the west and become a ciacoup college of sorts under the name of canvas center for applied nonviolent action and strategies 
the research article penned by carl gibson and steve horn and published on occupycom deals with the international financial intelligence and political connections of otpor and features the following information based on wikileaks documents
serbias srdja popovic is known by many as a leading architect of regime changes in eastern europe and elsewhere since the lates  and as one of the cofounders of otpor popovic and otpors offshoot canvas have also maintained close ties with a goldman sachs executive and the private intelligence firm stratfor as well as the us government 
such examples are easy to find the internal public opinion on otpor is that it is being employed as leverage to overthrow those governments which conflict with the interests of the us no wonder some media organizations that act on behalf of the us administration speak highly of otpor at every turn moreover the british media rigorously advocates that the executives of otpor have nothing to do with the organization of coups
likewise some turkish media organizations disseminated similar statements during the  gezi park demonstrations the attempt to occupy the prime ministers residence by armed groups which is an act of rebellion against the state and treason by law was orchestrated by otpor according to reports yet the media deliberately defined it as the exercise of legitimate democratic rights and freedom of expression by the people and thus desired to create misapprehension to display the members of the marxist and separatist terrorist organizations who are far from representing even a slightest portion of the nation as the representatives of the nation these media organs called the nations security forces who risked their lives to preserve public order and peoples lives as the socalled enemies of freedom and democracy
in truth such mass demonstrations that aim to topple governments divide countries and organize bloody conflicts  and even civil wars  can no longer be called innocent rallies but subtle projects of deep states and shadow organizations to take over countries from within",2016-11-16

coming this weekend over  million pilgrims will rally in the holy city of karbala to mark the greatest pilgrimage of all  arbaeen right at the heart of iraq surrounded by the terror of the black flag army it is communities of men which will gather in prayers and in mourning to perform the last rites of imam hussain ibn ali the grandson of the prophet muhammad
while arbaeen has eclipsed even the hajj in terms of attendance few  even within islam have ever heard of the pilgrimage let alone the tragedy it recalls never mind the principles it saw enacted
arbaeen it needs to be said stands very much an offense to wahhabism  this dogma the house of saud has furiously promoted to assert its ascent to power arbaeen it needs to be emphasised actually speaks of this eternal struggle in between good and evil freedom and slavery piety and dogmatism
 sidelined by mainstream media for it speaks of islams attachment and commitment to such values as justice freedom and compassion towards all men and all fashion of faiths arbaeen has nevertheless towered a beacon of hope amid the furious rise of radicalism arbaeen i would personally argue has become a grand symbol of resistance against oppression  the coming together of communities beyond their differences and most importantly perhaps in spite of their differences so that together they could oppose tyranny and offer the oppressed a rampart behind which to find refuge
for those of you who still have no idea what in the world i am talking about allow me to tell you the story of a man  a man whose courage resolute strength of character and yearning for truth have echoed across the centuries to inspire generations upon generations to think themselves free and to rise themselves independent from the yoke of tyranny
more messenger   muslims develop technology to promote religious unity against radicalism why muslims hold the biggest human gathering under the threat of isis in iraq the th days new campaign  communitybuilding and social solidarity shia muslims gather in dc for antiterror rally imam hussain ibn alis martyrdom in the plain of karbala over a millennium ago stands testimony to our collective struggle against injustice and though it is islams banner the third imam carried his message was a universal call for freedom  an immovable promise that real tragedy lies not in our failure to defeat tyrants but in our reluctance to oppose them
allow me to take you back a few centuries back when islams early history was still being written back when the name of the prophet muhammad was still murmured in the present tense through the lips of his progeny the house ahlulbayt
only a few decades after islams last prophets passed islam stood divided as a nationstate its religious sovereignty challenged by men of greed and oppression yazid ibn muawiyah was one of them  arguably the most barbaric of them all since he envisioned slaughter to be the legacy of his throne
as bigots brandished islam to rationalise their heresy and proclaim righteous exceptionalism before the abomination of their deeds imam hussain had no other choice but to march against yazid  even if alone for as long as there was breath in him it is justice he would command for all people
and so the imam marched on  from the holy city of mecca to the thendeserted plain of karbala he walked knowing death would be his fate and still he pushed on 
it is this determination to meet evil and not relent in the task which arbaeen speaks of most loudly it is allegiance loyalty and love pilgrims manifest into reality as they walk towards their imam united not faith but in their humanity
arbaeen you most likely were never told is not exclusive to islam arbaeen is neither shia nor sunni arbaeen is for all who dare think themselves free under god and in him seek refuge
and while arbaeen has long been associated to shia islam for its school of thought revolve around those very principles imam hussain consecrated with his death the pilgrimage stands not in opposition or rejection of any faith  quite the contrary since christians yezidis hussainis brahims alongside countless other religious denominations have year after year centuries after centuries come to karbala to remember
arbaeen is remembrance of hussain ibn ali remembrance of the word of god made complete through hussain the man the prophet muhammad called his son and whose leadership he commanded all believers to forever follow
if many failed in their allegiance for fear rendered them motionless before their imams calls hussains station in karbala has echoed ever since of a love so brilliant and unparalleled that all people all nations all faiths across time and space have found themselves compelled to walk the great walk of arbaeen  and through hussain ibn ali find their humanity
arbaeen i have to say speaks to the best of our humanity it is home after all to the best of humanity  martyr among all martyrs there has never been a day like hussains day  and though his name wahhabism has worked to bury under the rubbles of history karbala has remembered its imam with fierce loyalty
a city build around and for hussain ibn ali karbala is a declaration of allegiance to the house of the prophet  those extraordinary men and women whose hearts lips and prayers have spoken islam in wisdom and piety and without whom we would be orphans
every year without fail karbala has fervently commemorated its imam  even in oppression especially when in oppression
before the poison of radicalism karbala has offered generosity and compassion before brutal repression karbala has opened its doors and to all oppressed offered a shelter before the depravity of sectarianism karbalas pulpits have called upon men and women to hold to rope of allah never to disunite
a city surrounded by the evil of daesh karbala has never shun brighter
in the face of insane fanaticism imam hussains followers have never been braver
and so coming this november   karbala will let out a roar which will shook tyrants thrones karbala will offer all of its prayers and all of its devotion  hussains name will be etched on believers hearts tears of allegiance will flow fists will rise to the sky a promise that when called upon all will answer
islam today is best manifested in karbala since karbala shuns no one karbala today has put saudi arabia to shame since it has provided food and shelter to tens of millions of pilgrims  without expectation without any hope of a thank you
a city has proven more generous and compassionate in its destitution than saudi arabia in its wealth and might where the socalled custodians of islam have cried the weight of the hajj on their coffers karbala has provided beyond the mathematically feasible
in a few short days karbala will stop time once more  so that all could remember all martyrs are in fact alive and that the sons of hussain are still standing vigil",2016-11-19

shortly after hillary clintons crushing defeat the media came up with another spin zuckerberg and facebook were held responsible for her debacle what crap facebook apparently carried fake news didnt the media invent and promote precisely this kind of news to bounce hillary over the last hurdle its convenient for media whores to blame everybody except themselves and hillarys corrupt campaign organization for her defeat clinton labeled ordinary americans deplorables displaying her contempt for half of the population hillary clinton was favorite puppet of the establishment she was the embodiment of a hopelessly corrupt political system and the american people realized it despite massive attempts by media presstitutes to sell her image an estimated  per cent of media outlets beat the drums for her and for her husbands corrupt clinton foundation
the real reason behind the attempt to blame zuckerbergs facebook is that it makes everyone and no one responsible what is posted on facebook can no longer be controlled by the media and the political class they lost control of public opinion established methods of mindcontrol do not work any longer the fawning media report only what they are fed by government spindoctors it is more comfortable for them to act like the mouthpieces of their masters this holds true for us media as well of the media class in the european vassal states german media were for example as manipulative as those in the united states they celebrated president obama as the embodiment of good america ignoring that he waged wars during his entire presidency incarcerated several whistleblowers and signed off extralegal executions but he possessed a great advantage he was black or if you wish nonwhite obama was thus a nonwhite and smarter version of george w bush
when mark zuckerberg visited berlin in february  he was bootlicked by the german political and media class the springer group the most outspoken mouthpiece of us interests us in germany awarded him the axel springer award of greater political relevance was the dinner meeting between zuckerberg and chancellor angela merkel who tried to convince him to apply himself with more determination against socalled hatespeech on the internet the merkel regime considers that freedom of speech hurts her policy merkels minister of justice heiko maas has established some sort of a private internet police that hunts the web for hate speech whatever that means
there is no agreed upon definition what hate speech implies hence the meaning can be volatile or arbitrarily the range of hate speech can range from antimuslim rhetoric via personal insults and threats to a call to kill every jewish zionist there is a duty of government under the international convention for the abolition of all forms of racial discrimination to prohibit the dissemination of racial propaganda ergo there exists a legal and ethical basis for prohibiting certain forms of hate speech
even restrictions to free speech extend to other spheres such as prohibition of deceitful advertising slandering other people and in some countries advertising tobacco and alcohol is forbidden in iceland human rights law accepts the right of governments to restrict freedom of speech in order to protect other social values there is a great deal of jurisprudence regarding the question who to weigh this right against other rights
in germany this body of private detectives includes civil society groups such as klicksafede jugendschutznet gesicht zeigen show your face to name a few the most eminent of these is the amadeu antonio foundation run by a former stasi agent by the name of anetta kahane who claims to fight racism antisemitism and xenophobia today she and her organization are at the forefront of criticizing people who dare to criticize the excesses of merkels policy of government failure
internet giants such as facebook google and youtube and twitter also participated voluntarily in this constitutive meeting in which this kind of internet watchdog was set up in september  this new censorship body was established in the german ministry of justice and works since then without legal basis the participants agreed on best practices in handling hate messages there are no publically known criteria according to which one can recognize hate speach that means that this censorship body makes it decisions arbitrarily there are no rules or statutory provisions those whose messages are blocked have thus no legal recourse against such censorship despite such arbitrary practice the interim results which were presented in the ministry of justice on  september  were not satisfactory google and youtube and facebook representatives participated in the presentation of the results from august to september  punishable contents were reported that were deleted by the companies nevertheless the ministry of justice was not satisfied
thus it is not only the american political class which is blaming facebook for the defeat of its minion hillary clinton but also the german political class and its compliant media that intend to crack down on facebook fearing that ordinary people could endanger merkels quest for a renewed mandate as chancellor but what appears more important is their desperate attempt to control public opinion because the deplorables ie the mass of ordinary people do not anymore wish to be bamboozled by half a dozen editorsinchief the attempt to free themselves from such control has to be crushed with the help of facebook and google
at the beginning zuckerberg rejected the ridiculous accusations of being responsible for clintons defeat after a while it appears that he has accepted to do the dirty work for the censors and caved in on friday november   zuckerberg wrote on facebook that the amount of misinformation is relatively small nonetheless there is much work ahead on our roadmap the following work in progress was outlined by him
a stronger detection system the most important thing we can do is to improve our ability to classify misinformation this means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves
 easy reporting making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster
 third party verification there are many respected fact checking organizations and while we have reached out to some we plan to learn from many more
 warnings we are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community and showing warnings when people read or share them
 related articles quality we are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in news feed
 disrupting fake news economics a lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam were looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week and better ad farm detection
 listening we will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input in particular to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them
apparently zuckerberg understands the importance of the issue i beg to differ the issue is not about fake news it is about universal freedom of speech that poses a threat to the mindcontrol industry owned by a few families on both sides of the atlantic ocean if they lose this control of public opinion they rightly fear to lose in the long run their privileges
dear mr zuckerberg take courage and do not interfere with ordinary folks speaking their minds despite the pressure and intimidation by the political and media class
when one discusses freedom of expression and the role of facebook one point needs special scrutiny namely the private character of this entity the private character of an entity precludes transparency citizens and users do not possess any rights to inspect the finances let alone participate in determining facebook projects and policies as a citizen one cannot accept that one unelected person however nice he may be could determine the projects and policies of an entity that is now serving billions of human beings such a structure just cries for corruption and arbitrary rule one can see this operating within wikipedia where doctrinaires exert control over subjects of social science such as the circumstances of  or the israelpalestinian conflict its impossible to even insert critical question because they dont pass the censorship of certain guardians of mind control google is another such leviathan that cries for public and transparent ownership how such public ownership of a global corporation is to be accomplished is a question that begs for an answer the first step would certainly be for civil society without influence from the corporate world to get together and consider a more democratic and transparent structure for such global services it would be wise for civil society to get going before corporations will establish fake democratic forums to preempt this goal",2016-11-19

ayatollah khamenei has stated that genuine freedom of thought will help the country to progress in the absence of a free intellectual atmosphere there can be no opportunity for growth how do you as a professor perceive it
i reflected very selfconsciously on the prospects of contributing to the progress of my country canada when i opted in the mid to late s to go to graduate school at the university of toronto with the great canadian historian jms careless as my phd supervisor i made a commitment to study the history of colonial relations with the first nations of canada my course of study took me in  to my first appointment in the native studies department at the university of sudbury the university of sudbury was in those years a jesuitrun entity it formed the institutional seed from which the secular laurentian university would emerge in the decades prior to my appointment there
for the next two decades i was able to work from my academic bases in sudbury and then in lethbridge alberta beginning in  at the invitation of the leroy little bear the chair of the department of native american studies i thus moved to the resourcerich province of alberta once again i was motivated to make the transition in my professional work with the hope my i could contribute constructively to the progress of our country from an academic base in western canada
in my years as a young professor i took an active part in four first nationsfirst ministers conferences that took place in ottawa between  and  the purpose of these conferences was to negotiate a constitutional amendment to give greater definition to the phrase  the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of canada are hereby recognized and affirmed section  constitution act  
more the bnai brith and the history of the mounting assault on academic freedom in canadian universities creating an antimuslim bias at a canadian university suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere section  was part of the text of the instrument facilitating the movement of authority over canadas constitutional structure from the british imperial mother country to the domestic institutions of canadian federalism
the culmination of my contributions to the formulation of a madeincanada version of the canadian constitution involved my opposition between  and  to what became known as the meech lake accord if this political deal between canadas first ministers had become constitutional law the first nations of canada would have been excluded from a very powerful legal definition of canadas fundamental characteristic
in academic essays in the mainstream media and in presentations to various legislative committees i contributed to public awareness of the negative implications of the meech lake accord for fairminded canadians supportive of existing aboriginal and treaty rights more specifically i contributed to the strength of the platform from which an ojicree parliamentarian by the name of elijah harper used his veto power in the manitoba legislature to block the ratification of the meech lake accord because of elijah harpers actions the meech lake accord did not become part of canadas supreme law
i was able to contribute to discourse crucial to the progress of canada until about the year  between  and  i had to adjust my work away from the activities of the department of native american studies towards a field of my own making globalization studies i prepared two academic volumes to lay the academic foundation and methodological framework for my transition to a new academic role the core focus of my emphasis on globalization studies was indigenous peoples in encounter with colonialism globally from  until the present
it is in this context and with the encouragement of my very accomplished student joshua blakeney that i began to shift focus towards the treatment of palestinian and other arab peoples in the region of greater israel eretz israel it was joshua who also led me to my first interactions with iranian journalists resulting in my participation in the new horizon conference of the autumn of  as i have described in writing elsewhere this episode proved to make a major positive impact on me
due to the intervention of my colleague the mohawk activist splitting the sky i also began to see the events of  as a major factor in the shaping of the global geopolitics in the twentyfirst century
my quest for new academic turf at the has sometimes been bumpy and contested certainly many major obstacles were put in the way of my promotion to full professor eventually my academic peers were allowed to make their input into the promotion process apart from the artificial blockages thrown up by my university administration in  after what i took to be my obtaining a position of intellectual and professional security as a senior faculty member i resolved that henceforth i would pursue difficult lines of research and publication i made this decision with an understanding that less secure younger colleagues might eschew such a course of action
i have made no secret of the fact that i see the recent surrender of the high ground of academic freedom by the members of the administration of the as an indicator that canada is on a downwards spiral it seems to me there is a move a foot to sabotage the intellectual freedom of our universities if academic freedom is not to be respected in institutions of supposedly higher learning then there can be no basis for freedom of speech in environments not subject to the protections of tenure
the first to suffer the crackdown in universities will be our students they will have to deal with the fact that the treatment visited on me indicates it has become dangerous to ask pointed questions which might produce answers embarrassing to power our country canada cannot progress to higher levels of discourse and achievement under these repressive conditions
ayatollah khamenei believes exchanging viewpoints and opinions are in the nature of academic work how is this principle practiced at lethbridge university
i agree that exchanging viewpoints and opinions is a central aspect of academic work within universities and between universities i found that there was a good deal of openness to the exchange of information and ideas with colleagues media and public officials in the years between  and  when the core of my academic work revolved around the history of canadafirst nations relations
unfortunately i would have to say that the obstacles to the exchange of information and ideas began to mount significantly after  when i began to question the official narrative of what happened on  who really did what to whom during the initiating events of what soon became known as the global war on terror as i began to become skeptical of the official narrative i noticed more and more inclination on the part of colleagues to distance themselves from the subjects that captured my professional interest to put it bluntly i suppose it became clear to me that for a number of reasons it was not a good career move for younger colleagues to show interest in the subject of  specifically and false flag terrorism more generally
as i began to look more deeply into the existing research on  i was simultaneously drawn to the subject of war crimes and international law my collaboration with splitting the sky became more intense when we went to work to organize in response to the decision of the former us president george w bush to give a talk in calgary in  as his first public engagement as theoretically a regular civilian citizen our collective action in calgary in the spring of  led to a trial that we dubbed splitting the sky versus george w bush  although i had not yet associated the lies and crimes of  with israel first protagonists i ran into my first zionist pushback for my  studies when i presented my essay should george w bush be arrested in calgary alberta to be tried for international crimes i originally presented the paper at an invited talk at the university of winnipeg
my essay eventually ended up as an exhibit in the litigation that we referred to as splitting the sky versus george w bush  our stance was that the former us president should have been arrested in canada for being a crediblyaccused war criminal we were far from alone in bringing forward evidence that bush had violated many international covenants and conventions against for instance prohibited torture not only had he arguably violated international law but it seemed the former us president had violated canadas own crimes against humanity and war crimes act  the legislation had passed through parliament with the view that canada should not become a haven for war criminals
in pursuing this line of analysis i faced my first allegations that somehow my academic inquiry was antisemitic
as i worked on this subject one that i integrated into my pedagogy it became clear to me that we have never seen anything but victors justice when it comes to the enforcement of international law against those that commit war crimes crimes against humanity crimes against the peace and crimes against democracy it seems that only those on the losing side of military conflicts are ever brought to justice those on the winning side the stronger side are invariably held to be above the law
this line of scholarly investigation did result in various channels of academic exchange opening up for me with colleagues in my own university and other universities the most fruitful collaboration to develop however was that with dr kevin barrett who had lost his academic position at the university of wisconsin for incorporating related subjects into his research and pedagogy
for sure i should not be made to feel so alone in the academy when it comes to the study of  the most transformative event of the twentyfirst century in my view the academic institutions in north america and europe have failed abysmally in the study of false flag terrorism starting with the events of  i am particularly appalled by how this failure on the part of our institutions of higher learning has contributed to the rise of islamophobia as the necessary psychological condition giving license to those promoting the invasions of muslimmajority countries
in a meeting with president rouhani and his cabinet the leader of the islamic revolution said when it comes to caricatures insulting the sanctities of islam the west suddenly becomes an advocates of freedom and the freedom of expression however when it comes to the holocaust there is no freedom of expression why do you think we witness such double standards
a gross display of double standards plagues the ethnocentric way freedom is being defined in the socalled west the psychological operations attending the we are charlie hebdo ceremonies on paris in early  epitomized the hypocrisy the whole essence of this strange event in the city of lights seemed to signal that freedom of speech and expression in the west is virtually limitless when it comes to demeaning through cartoons of prophet mohammed as well as other sacred symbols of islamic religion the other side of the same coin are the many prohibitions imposed on for instance the french comedian mbala mbala dieudonné dieudonné was barred from entering canada for his efforts to make humor of the paranoid state of affairs attending any public references to jews jewish institutions or the activities of israel these days
one of my discoveries through this period of crisis is the fact that the thought police agents in the bnai brith equate my call for open debate on the holocaust and indeed open debate on all subjects as the equivalent of socalled holocaust denial how many of my colleagues at the and in other universities have bent before the harsh intimidation how many have made themselves proponents of shutting down open debate and allowing censorship from outside the academy to regulate our research teaching and publication
there is a controversial quote from ayatollah khamenei in which he says may god curse all those who put an end to political thoughts work and endeavor in universities whats your take on that how essential do you think such a perspective is for the academia
i agree wholeheartedly with the supreme leaders observation one of the great gifts of the creator to humans is the gift of reason and rationality our application of reason and rationality to our understanding of society will inevitably contribute to political thought work and endeavor
this type of applied reason should be especially vital in the work of universities where the highest level of political conception should be able to find expression elaboration and receptiveness indeed we need to make ourselves expert in universities at making safe places for the development of political discourse god curse us in the universities if we cannot be the home for vibrant political discourse",2016-11-19
328,mark zuckerberg dont get hoodwinked by media and politicians,"the iraqi city of karbala where the holy shrine of the third shia imam imam hussein is located is swarming with millions of devoted muslims both shiites and sunnis for mourning rituals marking arbaeen known as the largest religious gathering in the world  shares
   
given the mainstream medias constant sensationalized reporting on terror and muslims in the western world the utter lack of coverage of arbaeens march on sunday and monday revealed the double standard that exists in reporting on peaceful muslims
monday marked the final day of the mourning for imam hussein who was martyred in a battle with the massive army of yazid after refusing allegiance to the tyrant caliph yazid the caliph of umayyad dynasty was promoting the same type of islam as isis and wahhabist preach today
millions of marchers participated in the annual arbaeen procession in karbala the marchers are said to come from over  countries and most of them have marched all the way to karbala from other iraqi cities like najaf and baghdad in a show of devotion each year sunni muslims and followers of other religious groups such as christians join the journey to mourn the martyrdom of imam hussein
arbaeen or mourning is a shia muslim tradition to mark the anniversary of seventhcentury social justice leader imam husain arbaeen is commemorated  days after ashura the martyrdom anniversary of imam hussein as and his companions in  ad however in light of isis terror attacks globally several people took the controversial step of turning their march political in order to denounce terror in all forms
tens of thousands of muslims have been killed and displaced by isiss declared caliphate an exponentially larger number than those killed in attacks in the west
more the walk of light  arbaeen pilgrimage rises a great resistance against radicalism messenger   muslims develop technology to promote religious unity against radicalism why muslims hold the biggest human gathering under the threat of isis in iraq the th days new campaign  communitybuilding and social solidarity the occasion has found additional significance in recent years as it has become a rallying cry for the campaign against isis terrorists who have frequently targeted the pilgrims
iraqi troops have been deployed to ensure security for the pilgrims the northern and western parts of iraq have been plagued by gruesome violence ever since isis terrorists began a campaign of terror in the country in june 
the terrorist campaign however has not dissuaded pilgrims from around the world from making the journey
it is noteworthy to mention the mainstream media blackout of the millions people marched gathering in war torn iraq battling the isis as a clear sign of biased reporting",2016-11-21

mohsen abdelmoumen  according to you when we see the numerous demonstrations antitrump in the united states after the election of donald trump at the presidency are we witnessing a colored revolution
wayne madsen it is classic sorosfunded color revolution soros is financing moveonorg black lives matter demos and other of his groups to turn out protesters and is even running ads in papers looking for paid drivers and protest coordinators
in your very relevant books devoted to george soros soros quantum of chaos you reveal the true face of this figure who is the spearhead of several destabilization operations in the world from where does all the power come that this criminal holds and why is he untouchable
soros is very wealthy and actually a frontman for an even more powerful and wealthy person evelyn de rothschild along with his family they are all the true puppet masters of the world
soros remains a major element in the antitrump device can trump resist him
more disrespecting the american imperial presidency trump won now what will america survive the next  years defeating white liberalism in the age of trump trump is actually now being surrounded by people who will serve in his administration who will be loyal to the sorosrothschild puppet masters and certainly not to trump
can we say that the occult world is more powerful than legal institutions
secret societies with their crazy rituals have been the bane of human existence since the time of the sanhedrin and pharisees in palestine and the dionysian cults of the nile valley and the mediterranean region
in your book  isis is us  the shocking truth behind the army of terror you detail the relations between the usa and isisdaesh what is the triggering element that has put you on this trail
trumps national security adviser retired lt gen michael flynn revealed that the us was supporting isis and then he was forced to resign my own sources in the middle east confirmed this long before flynn made his public statement and was fired as defense intelligence agency chief by obama
you mention western sahara and the involvement of the clintons in a deal with the kingdom of morocco while this case is under the authority of un arent the clintons outlaws such bonnie and clyde by supporting morocco against the sahrawi people and the uns resolutions
the clintons received at least  million from the moroccan government in return for buying their loyalty to moroccos agenda which includes permanently annexing western sahara as the southern province morocco and israel share the same policy on annexing illegallyoccupied territories
according to your diverse very interesting analysis can we assert that the world government or the false prophets of the new world order are the real decisionmakers of this world
i mentioned a few already sorosrothschild others are the bilderbergs bohemian club and the council on foreign relations and their counterparts
you know very well some american intelligence agencies like the nsa do these intelligence agencies serve the us interests or rather the oligarchys interests
the cia has always served the interests of wall street nsa now serves the interests of the global security network it leads
you were an officer in the us navy was the whistleblower you are today born after your military career or before
before i was an fbinavy whistleblower in  and helped to uncover a major pedophile ring in the us navy that reached into the reaganbush white house and was ultimately exposed in the washington times in  my whistleblowing cost me my navy career however and a subsequent series of fairly bad jobs
in the recent us election we saw the mass media bankruptcy despite their manipulations and their fake polls didnt one of the pillars of world oligarchy collapse under our eyes dont we witness a historic moment announcing the end of the new world order and its purely capitalist product globalization
 percent of major newspapers endorsed clinton many alternative news sources supported trump we are seeing a massive shift away from newspapers and corporate tv and websites to the alternative media of which waynemadsenreportcom has been prominent since its founding in 
snowden has denounced the prism program and you have denounced echelon both of which serve the interests of the worlds oligarchic caste what is known is not only the immersed part of the iceberg
what is still relatively unknown is the close cooperation between nsa and private companies like microsoft apple google facebook and major telecommunications companies it is much greater than even snowdens documents describe
the quantity and especially the quality of your reports reveal to us a world unknown by millions of human beings how all these truths have been hidden
the major media cooperates with the government in covering up news events
i advise everyone to read the wayne madsen report as well as your books and follow your various interventions in the alternative media how do you explain that we who are resisting to what i call the fascist oligarchic caste are called conspiracy theorists is this concept the only weapon of the fascist imperialists to reduce to silence all those who resist them and to reinforce the ranks of those whose who have been brainwashed
the term conspiracy theorist was developed by the cia in the mids to ridicule those who believed there was a wide government role in the assassination of president kennedy it has been used ever since to describe legitimate researchers into irancontra  and other deep state crimes
your book  the star and the sword  is one of the few to talk about intimate and opaque links between the zionist entity of israel and saudi arabia you claim that they organize false flag attacks including the  what is the origin and nature of this israelisaudi strategic alliance do you think that the jasta law will succeed or will it be countered by the zionist allies of saudi arabia do the fact that the usa and the westerners turn a blind eye on the criminal war led by the saudis to yemen isnt due to the weight of the lobby zionist
the zionistwahhabisaudi alliance goes back to ibn saud who wrote the british and zionist leaders that he did not oppose a jewish homeland in palestine so long as it did not lay claim to saudi territory on the eastern shore of the gulf of aqaba the relationship has always been close except for the time of king faisal who was conveniently shot in the face and killed by a relative
do you undergo pressure or threats in relation to the remarkable work you do if so how do you live it
i was forced to move my domicile from washington because the outgoing obama administration put pressure on some media organizations i did work for these included rt contributor agreement canceled and al jazeera america which is now defunct
the fbi entered my apartment in washington at least twice and ive had three visits by them at my new home in florida
i was informed of  personal threats in washington
i ignore all these pressures and continue to exercise the freedom of the press
are you optimistic or do you think that the satanist project of the oligarchy still has a nuisance capacity that can plunge the world into chaos
as with cockroaches which detest light the shadow figures of covert power cannot stand what is known as the disinfectant of sunshine light has always fought against darkness and will continue to do so

when the dust settled on the nov  election we learned that a completely unpredictable egomaniacal narcissistic buffoon would inherit the white house and the vast powers that go along with it this deeply offended many people who see donald trumps racist and misogynistic rhetoric as unpresidential liberal new york times columnist charles blow summed up this view i respect the presidency i do not respect this presidentelect that the presidentelect should not be respected is a given but why should we respect the presidency
the imperial presidency of the united states has evolved over the last century to the point that the executive holds certain powers that can be considered dictatorial arguably the most consequential decision in politics is to wage war the constitution specifically reserves this right for congress the president as commanderinchief directs the wars that congress declares however starting with trumans intervention in the korean war in  and continuing with invasions of vietnam grenada iraq and afghanistan and the bombings of dozens more countries the presidents ability to unilaterally initiate war with a sovereign nation has been normalized congress has not declared war since  despite the fact the us military has intervened in nearly every corner of the world
in recent years george w bush assumed the power to kidnap torture and assassinate any individual anywhere in the world at any time without even a pretense of due process upon replacing bush barack obama legitimized bushs kidnapping and torture by refusing to prosecute the perpetrators or provide recourse to the victims while enthusiastically embracing the power to assassinate at will noam chomsky said obama has trashed the yearold magna carta which king john of england would have approved of
can there be anything more dictatorial than the power of a single individual to kill and make war at will while american presidents thankfully do not have the power to unilaterally impose taxes pass legislation or incarcerate without charges inside us borders the illegitimate authority they do possess to carry out unrestrained violence across the world is unquestionably one feature of a dictator
there has not been a single american president since world war ii that has not exceeded his constitutional authority by committing crimes that would meet the standard by which officials were convicted and executed at the nuremberg trials
roosevelts executive order  to imprison japanese americans in concentration camps was a flagrant violation of the fifth amendment right not to be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law
more wayne madsen the cia has always served the interests of wall street trump won now what will america survive the next  years defeating white liberalism in the age of trump trumans firebombing of tokyo nuclear bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki and invasion of korea violated provisions of multiple treaties that are considered the supreme law of the land per article vi of the us constitution
eisenhowers use of the cia to overthrow democratically elected presidents in iran and guatemala as well as the initiation of a terrorist campaign against cuba violated the un charter another international treaty that the constitution regards as the supreme law of the land
kennedy was guilty of approving the creation of a mercenary army to invade cuba as well as covert warfare in vietnam johnson massively escalated us military involvement in vietnam with the introduction of ground troops which he fraudulently justified to the public through misrepresentation of the gulf of tonkin incident
succeeding johnson nixon waged a nearly genocidal air campaign against not only vietnam but cambodia and laos killing hundreds of thousands of people destroying ecosystems across indochina and leaving an unfathomable amount of unexploded ordnance  which continues to kill and maim hundreds of people each year
ford covertly supported the south african invasion of angola and overtly supported the indonesian invasion of east timor carter continued support of the indonesian occupation of east timor as well as providing military support to military dictatorships in guatemala and el salvador reagan oversaw the creation and operation of a terrorist army in nicaragua sponsored military dictatorships throughout central america and directly invaded grenada
bush the elder invaded panama and iraq clinton oversaw sanctions in iraq that killed as many as  million people carried out an air war from  feet against serbia and bombed a pharmaceutical plant in sudan that produced medications for half the country bush the lesser invaded and occupied afghanistan and iraq obama continued both of those wars as well as dramatically expanding the drone assassination program in as many as seven countries
so i beg to differ with blow and anyone else who claims the presidency deserves respect any institution or position that permits such illegal and immoral actions unchecked should be eradicated and replaced with some alternative that does not allow such concentration of power in the hands of a single person
liberal clinton defender matt yglesias argues that from a historical perspective trump is uniquely dangerous past presidents yglesias writes have simply been restrained by restraint  by a belief that there are certain things one simply cannot try or do
it is hard to take such vacuous proclamations with a straight face as we have seen every single american president since at least wwii has engaged in serious violations of international and domestic law to cause death destruction and misery across the world from murdering individuals without due process to unleashing two nuclear bombs on civilian populations in a defeated country that was seeking to surrender
when trump assumes the presidency he will inherit a frightening surveillancemilitaryincarceration apparatus that includes a targeted killing program a vast nsa domestic and international spying network a death squad the joint special operations command and an extralegal system for indefinite kidnapping and imprisonment at guantanamo bay
partisans see a problem only when the presidency is in the wrong hands if obama is at the helm liberals are fine with unconstitutional mass surveillance or killing an american citizen without charge or trial every now and then conservatives trusted bush to warrantlessly surveill americans but were outraged at the snowden revelations
principled opponents recognize that no one should be trusted with illegitimate authority the handwringing and hyperventilation by liberals about the dangers of a trump presidency ring hollow and hypocritical
american presidents long ago became the equivalent of elected monarchs beyond the democratic control of the those they purportedly serve the occupant of the office is able to substitute his own judgments and whims for a universally applicable set of laws and limits on the exercise of power it is what dolores vek describes as actually existing fascism both parties have contributed to it the media has normalized it and the public has accepted its creation and continued existence without rebelling against it its time to stop treating the presidency itself with respect and start actively delegitimizing it",2016-11-22

the small jump needed for egyptiansyrian relations to go back to normal that syrian prime minister walid almuallem spoke of has been achieved apparently mohammad ballout from assafir lebanese daily  reported that some egyptian military formations have recently arrived to syria signaling an end to the time where egypt simply stood by hands crossed looking at the goingson in syria 
it seems that the egyptians have sent  helicopter pilots to the hamah airbase and it is hoped that they will see action in joint egyptiansyrian operations 
four senior egyptian military figures also joined the unit when it first came to syria and two major generals have been operating at the armed forces staff headquarters in damascus near the operations room the two major generals have been touring the fronts since they arrived a month ago and have been reviewing the efforts made at the fronts most recently the southern front at quneitra 
these new developments are apparently the result of intensive unannounced high profile security meetings that began over a year ago between cairo and damascus arab sources also expect that these developments will go beyond these symbolic operations and will see egyptian task forces operating on a large scale in support of the syrian army 
moreover a senior syrian security official also said that the egyptians have promised to send forces to syria and have schedule postdecember rd as the zerohour whereupon egyptian participation in syria will escalate another official also revealed that after december a large number of egyptian forces will also participate in the syrian operations and their participation will not be limited to aerial support more",2016-11-23

and the mainstream media are certainly giving new meaning to william shakespeares  fight to the last gasp  quote but what none of them seem to realize yet as they cry scream riot and offer their mea culpas is that the fight is over the election is finished their opponents have gone home to celebrate and they are doing nothing but flailing in the wind while grunting incoherentlywhile anyone can see the headlines about the third day of protests and riots and how those that are incapable of understanding quite how elections work and are holding out for a pipedream that maybe they can make electors of the electoral college change their vote what many are missing is how the mainstream media is attempting to suck more air out oxygen tanks that have gone empty and they have no one to blame but themselves the ultimate losers in the  election  the msm for the last year and a half we have witnessed and reported on the mainstream medias unrelenting and unapologetic campaign against donald trump where  percent of the reporting since the partys convention where he was named the gop nominee has been studied and found to have been negative but even before that they treated trump as if he didnt stand a chance to win that nominationwe have noted and reported via wikileaks releases how that very same msm had colluded with the dnc and the clinton campaign in order to influence the public to elect hillary clintonwe have also observed and reported how trump supporters were constantly labeled and portrayed as racist sexist xenophobic islamophobic uneducated uninformed white nationalist deplorables just to name a few of the colorful descriptorshow did that work out for themdespite their biased reporting and throwing everything including the kitchen sink at trump we now have presidentelect donald trump headed for the white house to be sworn in on january   while hillary clinton will fade into obscurity and the protesters will eventually go home just to criticize everything trump does for the next four maybe  years and progressives will get over their sworn revolution within the party between liberals and moderate democrats the ultimate losers are not clinton supporters celebrities that swore to leave the country if trump won nor democrats as a party it is the mainstream media that was rendered irrelevant crushed by a wave of deplorables and alternative media bypassing their onceinfluential status to communicate without their fasle prism of truth msms last gasp now they are offering their mea culpas dedicating countless hours and ink to explaining and justifying how they were so wrong in their predictions that they knew ahead of time were based on a false premise and taking their last gasp by swearing to rededicate themselves to reporting honestly while at the same time claiming they reported on both candidates fairlyi kid you notbelow is a letter by arthur o sulzberger jr and dean baquet the publisher and editor of the new york timesfirst point is that if they had been reporting fairly as claimed in the letter above they would not need to rededicate themselves to honesty secondly they did not strive to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences of trump supporters rather they maligned criticized belittled and mocked anybody that did not agree with their superior and smug political opinionwhile it is to be expected that trump supporters verbally abused on a regular basis will not forget nor forgive media outlets such as the times the public editor liz spayd who works independently with the job of examining the times with an eye to protecting journalistic integrity and good practices describes the reaction from other members of the public to their reporting readers are sending letters of complaint at a rapid rate heres one that summed up the feelings succinctly from kathleen casey of houston now that the world has been upended and you are all to a person in a state of surprise and shock you may want to consider whether you should change your focus from telling the reader what and how to think and instead devote yourselves to finding out what the reader and nonreaders actually think another letter from nick crawford of plymouth mich made a similar point perhaps the election result would not be such a surprise if your reporting had acknowledged what ordinary americans care about rather than pushing the limited agenda of your editors he wrote please come down from your new york city skyscraper and join the rest of us what ms spayd does not acknowledge is that their reporting will not and cannot change as long as their publisher and editor the ones that wrote the letter in the image above continue to insist their reporting during the campaign season was in any way fair or to even pretend they attempted to understand and reflect all political perspectives what ms spayd also does not address is the fact that five different new york times reporters accepted the invitations for the offtherecord gatherings to frame the hrc message with the clinton campaign staff before her campaign launched including gail collins jonathan martin maggie haberman patrick healy and amy chozick all of which consistently penned hit pieces against trumpit is heartening to see that outlets like the new york times are being called to the carpet by their own readers as well as admitting they are losing subscribers because while trump supporters were maligned and lied about their readers were misinformed and lied to  the countrys major news organizations as surprised as anybody by donald j trumps ascension to the presidency faced a question from their audiences on wednesday that was laced with a sense of betrayal and anger how did you get it so wrong the question came in letters to editors and writers of the nyt one reader wrote you were so wrong for so long you misled your readers and were blinded by your own journalistic bigotry it came in facebook posts you were in a bubble and werent paying attention to your fellow americans the filmmaker michael moore wrote in a post shared more than  times most ominously it came in the form of canceled subscriptions something that will surely be monitored former times reporter michael goodwin offers the times some free advice  using an outside law firm or even inhouse reporters he must assess how and why baquet made the decision to sever the paper from its roots he must assess the impact on reporters and editors and whether they felt pressure to conform their stories to baquets political bias whatever the findings the publisher must insist that the standards of fairness again become a fundamental tenet in the news room as an added guarantee he must insist that the paper enlarge its thinking about diversity to include journalists who disagree with the times embedded liberal slant there has to be a difference of perspective to judge where fairness lies readers and former readers should be part of the process many already know that the paper must get its head out of parochial new york and into the hearts and minds of americans everywhere this is about survival if it doesnt change now the gray ladys days surely are numbered bottom line frankly i believe traditional medias days are numbered whatever they do and they are on their last gasp there are too many independent journalists and alternative news sites from both sides of the political aisle that are rendering them irrelevant while alternative media has its own set of biases the majority always provide links documents when available video clips and other methods for readers to verify research and come to their own conclusions something mainstream media doesnt want readers to do because they feel they have the right to lead the public where the msm wants them to go rather than inform the public and trust them to make their own determinations,2016-11-24

wikileaks has revealed some rather troubling things about hillary clinton and her staffers but perhaps the most disturbing a bizarre is the fact that john podesta is involved with satanic rituals 
no this isnt fiction and im not wearing tin foil on my head an email released by wikileaks reveals podesta was invited to a spirit cooking dinner by performance artist marina abramovic and you can rest assured that its not anything like it sounds 
i am so looking forward to the spirit cooking dinner at my place do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining all my love marina an email dated june   read 
shortly after the emails which was sent to podestas brother tony was forwarded to john with the message are you in nyc thursday july  marina wants you to come to dinner 
now youre probably wondering what all the fuss is about and i seriously cant blame you so lets turn to paul joseph watson from infowars for a little background on what this spirit cooking is really all about 
spirit cooking refers to a sacrament in the religion of thelema which was founded by aleister crowley and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood breast milk urine and sperm are used to create a painting 
according to marina abramovic if the ritual is performed in an art gallery it is merely art but if the ritual is performed privately then it represents an intimate spiritual ceremony 
the video embedded above depicts the bizarre nature of the ceremony abramovic mixes together thickly congealed blood as the recipe for the painting which is comprised of the words with a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand eat the pain 
the ceremony is meant to symbolize the union between the microcosm man and the macrocosm the divine which is a representation of one of the prime maxims in hermeticism as above so below 
below is a video of abramovic conducting the satanic ritual 
how creepy even creepier is the same woman holding a bloody goats head  a representation of the satanist symbol baphomet the podestasspirit cooking dinnerits not what you thinkits blood sperm and breastmilk

344,breaking hillary just lost the black vote trump is going all the way to the white house,"dean james americas freedom fighters  
last week the pentagon issued a defense department directive that allows department of defense dd personnel to carry firearms and employ deadly force while performing official duties 
the defense department has been working on changing the gunfree zones on domestic military basis for several years in light of the deadly shootings at military sites in recent years 
militarycom reports that the directive also provides detailed guidance to the services for permitting soldiers sailors airmen marines and coast guard personnel to carry privately owned firearms on dod property it authorizes commanders  and aboveto grant permission to dod personnel requesting to carry a privately owned firearm concealed or open carry on dod property for a personal protection purpose not related to performance of an official duty or status 
the directive also makes clear that dod will consider further changes to grant standard authorizations for other dod personnel who are trained in the scaled use of force or who have been previously qualified to use a governmentissued firearm to carry a firearm in the performance of official duties on dod property this would allow dod with certain combat training to carry firearms without going through the additional step of making application with a commander 
kim smith at conservative tribune notes that the policy was a response to an nrabacked provision in the  national defense authorization act that required the defense department to allow more service members to carry firearms on base 
it is a good first step in that it recognizes personal protection is a valid issue for service members but there are many roadblocks in the way of making that option available nra spokeswoman jennifer baker told the washington free beacon  
those wishing to apply for permission to carry a firearm must be at least  years old and meet all federal state and local laws the directive said 
it would appear that the pentagon saw no problems with implementing a policy for which presidentelect donald trump has expressed support 
presidentelect donald trump ran on removing gunfree zones from military bases on july   breitbart news reported that trump pledged to end the gunfree scenarios for us troops by mandating that soldiers remain armed and on alert at our military bases 
the immediate institution of this directive probably left president barack obama incensed but he undoubtedly realized that there was nothing he could do to prevent its implementation in a couple of months anyway and thats good news because it works to ensure the safety of our troops which should always be a priority

345,breaking wikileaks reveals hillarys campaign chair engages in satanic rituals,"posted on october   blacks and liberals want to abolish science dan roodt american renaissance october   the south african fallist movement finds another target 
on my recent visit to stockholm for the identitarian conference some swedes and i compared notes on whose country was the most crazyliberal and antiwhite the swedes pointed to a short video recently released by an ngo that said swedes should integrate into the culture of thirdworld immigrants to form a new country 
my swedish colleagues agreed with french author renaud camus writing on free west media  he argues that whereas white populations everywhere seem determined to be replaced by thirdworlders the case of sweden is even more tragic more extreme more insane nowhere else do a people and a nation show a stronger will to suicide 
but i believe south africa is worse we have actual laws regulations and policies that require corporations universities and sports bodies to replace whites our country has become the world champion of antiwhite antiwestern ideology together with our northern neighbor zimbabwe we are to multiculturalism what pol pots shortlived democratic kampuchea was to communism its most extreme expression pol pot waged genocide against the entire middle class of cambodia in order to start a new society 
south africas ruling elite also wants a new society that will be cleansed of western influences and even the white race as robert mugabe put it during his famous  visit to soweto i dont want to see a white face 
the current upheavals at our universitiesknown absurdly as the fallist movementhave been widely reported enraged black students egged on by understanding whites have demanded that one thing after another must fall each accompanied by its own hashtag first it was rhodesmustfall the statue of cecil rhodes at the university of cape town then afrikaansmustfall blacks want to eliminate afrikaans as a language of university instruction followed by feesmustfall they want tuition fees abolished and now sciencemustfall 
in a video that has had nearly a million views a female black student at the university of cape town called for science to be scrapped saying 
if i personally were committed to decolonization science as a whole is a product of western modernity and the whole thing should be scratched off so if you want practical solutions to how to decolonize science we have to restart science fromi dont knowfrom an african perspective from our perspective from how weve experienced science for instance i have a question for all the science people there is a place in kzn called umhlabuyalingana they believe that through the magic the black magicyou call it black magic they call it witchcraftyou are able to send lightening to strike someone can you explain that scientifically because its something that happens 
the initial reaction was widespread ridicule from ordinary whites but i knew that her dismissal of western science was not taking place in a vacuum and was connected with the culturalmarxist ideas swirling through most western universities after all herbert marcuse one of the founders of cultural marxism wrote this in an essay on liberation in  at the height of us student radicalism 
this is the hippie subculture tripgrasspotacid and so on but a far more subversive universe of discourse announces itself in the language of black militants here is a systematic linguistic rebellion which smashes the ideological context in which the words are employed and defined and places them into the opposite contextnegation of the established one thus the blacks take over some of the most sublime and sublimated concepts of western civilization desublimate and redefine them p  
needless to say marcuse approved of the black take over and if he were alive today he would surely applaud what is happening in south africa not only are blacks taking over western concepts and changing them into their opposites they are taking over our institutions as well 
in universities and the mainstream media there was actually praising this young fallist i was only slightly surprised to read a piece in afrikaans entitled  sciencemustfall nie so belaglik soos dit mag klink  sciencemustfall not so ridiculous as it sounds it was written by liezel de lange the managing director of our sunday newspaper rapport  which once supported apartheid and segregation 
miss de lange first confessed ignorance because she attended the university of pretoria in the days when it still taught western ideas and culture she laments that when she studied english literature almost all our prescribed works were from britain and ireland as well as the usa i have to give my lecturers at the time credit for assigning readings from wole soyinka chinua achebe and ngugi wa thiongo most westerners no doubt have deficient educations because they have not been taught ngugi wa thiongo 
although liezel de lange did not exactly endorse the sciencemustfall idea in defense of the young fallist she evoked the mythical medieval african university of timbuktu as evidence that africas vast contributions to world learning are being ignored in fact timbuktu was a center for islamic and tuareg schools not a hub of forgotten african or black science nor are africans themselves united in wanting to preserve what is left of the medieval african university recent al qaeda activity in the region has been so destructive that the new yorker recently ran a story called  has the great library of timbuktu been lost  
i asked liezel de lange on twitter whether she was an afrocentrist but she evaded the question answering that she merely posits that not all knowledge wisdom and insight come from the west its hard to disagree with that 
miss de langes column was just a watereddown version of a more radical piece she had read on the leftwing website the daily maverick by joel modiri called  in the fall decolonisation and the rejuvenation of the academic project in south africa  
mr modiri is a black academic at unisa university of south africa which has been racially transformedmeaning that whites have been all but banished it is africas largest correspondence university naturally founded by south african whites mr modiri explained that her the fallists error proves her point he decried 
the presentation of knowledge by south african universities as predominantly the product of the west and the failure to recognize that some of the major scientific disciplines medicine physics astronomy mathematics among others have deep heritages in africa china and india     
in other words she is a victim of the false eurocentric view that science is western to begin with some american blacks have long maintained that the west stole its knowledge from africa they never explain how science could be stolen from one people by another leaving no trace behind knowledge is not like the mona lisa which cannot exist in more than one place so it is strange that the wise africans who conceived of science and culture no longer possessed it once it was stolen from them 
but we have to remember samuel huntingtons dictum in his book the clash of civilizations and the remaking of world order  culture follows power if anything this is what the rest of the world might learn from south africa whoever dominates politically will impose his culture and beliefs even if they are more primitive than those it replaces once the scientist has been politically and culturally subjugated he may have to bow down to the witchdoctor 
unfortunately it is not only pseudointellectual blacks such as mr modiri who hate the west one of the most europhobic statements in support of the black uct student came from stuart theobald a whiteliberal english south african academic who divides his time between london and johannesburg 
in the same rapport that liezel de lange edits mr theobald writes of the need to decolonize science because it has been used to justify racism and to support biological racism he continues 
we are kidding ourselves if we pretend that colonial attitudes are not still affecting the way science works today this is why a deliberate effort to decolonise science is valuable and south african universities have the opportunity to lead the charge 
he adds that we need a new paradigm in science that recognises the racism embedded in much of scientific practice and methodology and that a postcolonial science that is shorn of the straitjacket of past thinking will solve problems that now baffle us he notes the fuss made over the fallist students comments and then asks but when you see the entanglement of racism and science can you blame her 
are south african blacks and white liberals ready to ditch science in favor of the dark arts as harry potter would say if they have tooth aches or appendicitis i suspect they will submit to the humiliation of colonial science rather than look for a cure in the traditional rituals and voodoo of africa",2016-11-04
346,breaking trump just gave obama horrible news check out what the pentagon just did,"a lot of people in the us are suddenly identifying as white eric d knowles and linda r tropp quartz october   
many political commentators credit donald trumps rise to white voters antipathy toward racial and ethnic minorities however we believe this focus on racial resentment obscures another important aspect of racial thinking 
in a study of white americans attitudes and candidate preferences we found that trumps success reflects the rise of white identity politicsan attempt to protect the collective interests of white voters via the ballot box whereas racial prejudice refers to animosity toward other racial groups white identity reflects a sense of connection to fellow white americans 
were not the first to tie trumps candidacy to white identity politics  but our data provide some of the clearest evidence that ongoing demographic changes in the united states are increasing white racial identity white identity in turn is pushing white americans to support trump 
white identity 
when we talk about white identity were not referring to the altright fringe the white nationalist movement or others who espouse racist beliefs rather were talking about everyday white americans who perhaps for the first time are racially conscious 
snip 
nonhispanic whites are projected to become a minority in the year  this increasing diversity across the country is making whites own race harder and harder to ignore snip 
trump and white identity politics 
as whites increasingly sense that their status in society is falling  white racial identity is becoming politicized trumps promise to make america great again speaks to these anxieties by recalling a past in which white people dominated every aspect of politics and society snip 
snip 
to test our ideas about trump and white identity politics we surveyed a nationally representative sample of about  white americans the survey covered racial identities attitudes and political preferences in examining the relationship between white identity and ethnic diversity we chose to focus on an ethnic minority of particular salience in contemporary politics hispanics snip 
do whites from heavily hispanic neighborhoods show stronger white racial identity to measure identity we used a widelyused questionnaire  on a fivepoint scale participants rated their agreement with items such as being a white person is an important part of how i see myself and i feel solidarity with other white people as shown in the graph below there is a positive relationship between exposure to hispanics and white respondents sense of racial identity 
and does white identity lead to support for donald trump we examined the relationship between white identity and respondents likelihood of supporting trump for the presidency versus hillary clinton or several republican primary challengers consistent with others analyses  white identity strongly predicts a preference for trump 
whites at the high end of the racial identity scale are more than four times as likely to support trump than those at the low end of the scale perhaps thats because whites highest in racial identity are also the ones most likely to harbor negative attitudes against latinos indeed we found white identity was significantly correlated with another characteristicprejudice 
however differences in prejudice dont explain the relationship between white identity and trump support the pattern in the figure above was tested while statistically controlling for levels of antihispanic prejudice because the relationship between identity and support for trump remains strong we are confident that white identity independently predicts greater trump support 
weve seen that living close to hispanics leads whites to develop a strong sense of racial identity and that strong racial identity is associated with support for donald trump we should therefore expect that whites in heavily hispanic neighborhoods support trump more often than those in neighborhoods with fewer hispanics this prediction gains credence from work by political scientist ryan enos who finds that everyday exposure to latinos can increase support for restrictive immigration policies 
whites support for donald trump is in fact greatest in areas with a large hispanic population

350,surge of migrants illegally crossing usmexico border ahead of election,"dont root root root for the racist redface team from cleveland paul thornton los angeles times october   
how i wish it were the dodgers who took the field tuesday night in cleveland yes were all sad in los angeles that our team is now one year closer to celebrating the th anniversary of its last world series appearance but this goes beyond provincialism and wounded civil pride 
the dodgers deserved the chance to humiliate a cleveland baseball team that not only persists in identifying itself as the indians but also resurrected the laughably racist redfaced mascot chief wahoo just in time for the playoffs 
for those who havent kept up with the baseball drama heres a summary the cleveland team drew the curtain on its regularseason minstrel show in the spring having replaced chief wahoo on its caps with a vintage red c it never officially retired the offending mascot but wahoo remained confined only to uniform sleeves throughout the regular season leading reasonable people to believe that the team ownership had finally seen the light where other franchises such as the nfls washington redskins remained defiantly in the dark and was easing its fans into the postindians era 
or so we thought chief wahoo reappeared when the cleveland team began its impressive playoff run against the boston red sox and he hasnt left he remained stitched on hats and held aloft by adoring cleveland fans as the team convincingly defeated the toronto blue jays even surviving a legal attack by advocates of canadas indigenous peoples that threatened to forbid even so much as the use of the term indians while the team was on canadian soil 
snip 
its tempting to look past all this and take pity on a city thats had it as rough as cleveland the cubs championship drought has famously lasted for  baseball seasons but the cleveland team boasts a pitiable  years without a world series title beyond sports clevelands decline as an important american metropolis is arguably unmatched having tumbled from a population peak of plus in  to less than  today snip 
but cleveland hey i know some generous wonderfully caring people from that part of ohio which makes wishing for their teams brutal defeat personally difficult but being on the right side of a moral dispute isnt supposed to be easy especially when the team in question isnt the evil washington redskins and its infernal owner daniel snyder clevelands municipal misery doesnt excuse the disgraceful exalting of chief wahoo any more than white mens economic hardship makes donald trumps popularity ok

organized by george s qiao  the group of students had publicized their protest over various email lists describing what they consider inadequate attempts to remove the japanese stereotypes and appropriation of japanese culture that remained latent in the adapted productions storyline but later qiao said that he thought the tone of his initial concerns was unfair to the players 
i fully believe that members of the gilbert and sullivan players put their blood sweat and tears into trying to improve this staging of the production qiao said however i believe that there is still insufficient critical engagement with this plays history of japanese cultural misrepresentation

355,chinese immigrants demand protection from paris muggers,"posted on october   media selfdestruct over trump jared taylor american renaissance october   their hysteria and dishonesty have backfired 
from the start of donald trumps campaign the media have covered him dishonestly they have consistently portrayed him as a closet white supremacist who deliberately appeals to racists they have tried to tie him to a wicked movement known as the altright they are now working on another dishonest angle that donald trump is mainstreaming hate and bringing racism into public discourse the media clearly want to stampede voters into mrs clintons camp so as to spare us the agony of a racist in the white house 
the demonization campaign has backfired by trying to hang racial dissidents around donald trumps neck the media have given american renaissance and other organizations far more publicity than ever before at the same time constant shouts of racist and bigot dont seem to hurt mr trump instead they are wrecking what is left of media credibility the biggest irony though is that donald trump is probably not one of us at all but even small deviations from the castiron orthodoxy of race are enough to plunge our rulers into dark fantasies about donald trump as a secret david duke fan 
media dishonesty started immediately when mr trump pointed out that some immigrants from mexico were criminals the press acted as if he had said all mexican immigrants are criminals then when alert news hounds discovered that those of us they love to call haters and white supremacists liked mr trump there was no end of articles with titles such as  meet the horde of neonazis klansmen and other extremist leaders endorsing donald trump   top racists and neonazis back donald trump   heil donald trump neonazis white supremacists show support  and  the white nationalists who support donald trump  
these articles had a simpleminded purpose discredit mr trump by parading before the reader any nazi kluxer or racially conscious white person who had anything nice to say about the candidate the implication was that if racists were going to vote for donald trump he must be racist too 
this was deceitful and onesided when the chairman of the american communist party endorsed hillary clinton  no one suggested this meant she was a communist 
it is true that mr trump gave the media just enough of an excuse to pretend he really is a closet bigot because he did not repudiate racists with the snorts of indignation respectability requires there was the famous exchange in february when a reporter pushed mr trump to disavow an endorsement from david duke as the hill reported it  david duke endorsed me ok alright i disavow ok trump said seeking to quickly move on to another question 
that same month there was another famous exchange with jake tapper of cnn  
tapper  will you unequivocally condemn david duke and say that you dont want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election 
donald trump  well just so you understand i dont know anything about david duke ok i dont know anything about what youre even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists so i dont know i dont know did he endorse me or whats going on because you know i know nothing about david duke i know nothing about white supremacists 
the media leaped on these exchanges with shouts of joy trump refuses to disavow white supremacists thats because he is one 
there are far better explanations first donald trump is a pugnacious man he doesnt like being pushed around by anyone especially not by journalists who hate him if mr tapper had belligerently demanded that mr trump agree that the sky is blue mr trump would have bridled at that 
second donald trump probably doesnt know anything about david duke or white supremacy i would be astonished if he has ever looked into the thinking of david duke or any other alleged white supremacist it is his feistiness and his ignorance of white advocacy that explain his answers not some carefully concealed racial consciousness 
the press has also pounced on donald trumps retweets of racist material which is supposed to be yet more proof that he is a secret supremacist business insider for example published this shocking story   times donald trump has engaged with altright racists on twitter  not one of these tweets is obviously racist and it would be surprising if mr trump or his skeleton staff took the time to vet the sources of the thousands of tweets realdonaldtrump has sent during the campaign 
now the press is working on another smeartrump angle recently i have been contacted by journalists from such places as bloomberg news reuters and the new york times  who clearly want to write that donald trump is mainstreaming hate that he is responsible for a huge surge in the altright they want to know about all the people who have been flocking to amrencom because of what donald trump says they want me to tell them about people who have been emboldened to speak out against minorities because donald trump has led the way they would love to find someone who now thinks he is free to run down the street shouting nigger because mr trump wants to take a hard look at muslim immigrants 
i have explained to them as patiently as i can that they have it the wrong way around no one comes looking for amrencom because donald trump wants to build a wall they come looking for us because the media have written about us in their attempt to convince the world that mr trump is a racist they come looking for us because mrs clinton kindly called attention to us by complaining about the altright and her basket of deplorables i also try to explain that if the media had not launched its malicious campaign of trying to hold donald trump responsible for the views of certain people who support him few people would have heard of the altright in their zeal to paint their enemy in the darkest colors they are promoting the altright not donald trump 
i explain that racial dissent has been growing like never before for reasons that have nothing to do with the campaign it is trayvon martin michael brown black lives matters and black rioters who are sending hundreds of thousands of frustrated white people our way not donald trump this will not change whether mr trump wins or loses the top landing pages on amrencom are analyses of race and crimesomething mr trump never talks about 
i also explain to reporters that it is idiotic to think mr trump has mainstreamed hate by which they mean sensible observations about race i ask them to name a single person who has been emboldened to say something racist just because donald trump is the gop nominee of course they cant if anything it is the opposite mr trump has been called every name under the sun for the mildest most commonsense observations about muslims and immigration anyone tempted to come out of the closet is likely to hesitate more than ever things could change if mr trump becomes president but the candidate himself has done very little to spread our ideas 
what donald trump has done is spark an unprecedented interest in politics among disaffected young people who recognize that mitt romney and john mccain are no different from barack obama when it comes to preserving whites their society and their culture i know a number of millennials who never bothered to vote before but who certainly will in november i know some who have made their first political contribution or who have spent weekends volunteering for the trump campaign 
i point out to reporters that this is what elections are supposed to be all about giving the voters real choices i note that the trumpclinton contest will almost certainly produce a record voter turnout for a modern election havent our rulers been wringing their hands over a lack of political engagement especially among the young well now they have engagement alright but they dont like it they dont like it because so many people are stumping for the candidate they love to call a  threat to democracy  liberals are such transparent hypocrites they claim to love democracy but suddenly start worrying about its health if the people refuse vote the way they tell them to 
the whole trumpisaracist fracas shows just how painfully fragile orthodoxy has become i may be wrong but i have no reason to think donald trump thinks at all as we do he has never said or done anything to suggest he is anything more than an ordinary american with normal instincts he doesnt want criminals sneaking across the border he thinks sanctuary cities for illegals are crazy he doesnt see why we need more muslims and he is angry when immigrants go on welfare millions of ordinary americans clearly agree with him and not because they are racially aware it is because they are decent fairminded people who also have a nagging sense that the country is changing in unwelcome ways 
i am convinced that mr trump does not have a sophisticated understanding of race so far as i can tell he doesnt have a sophisticated understanding of much of anything he has stumbled by instinct onto a few sensible policies that white advocates have been promoting for a long time but not because he is one of us 
maybejust maybehe will move in our direction its not impossible to imagine a president trump asking in an offhand way whats wrong with white people wanting to remain a majority in the united states or he might casually note that you cant expect as many blacks as asians in ap classes because they dont have the same levels of intelligence but i can imagine the opposite too president trump so bogged down in beltway baloney that he never even builds the wall 
there is one thing that donald trump has changed he has proven that republican bromides about taxes and small government dont excite people he has proven that there is tremendous anger against political insiders of both parties he has proven that americans do want their country to come first they dont want it to try to save the world or to be a dumping ground for people who have wrecked their own countries 
and even if he has not mainstreamed racism he has shown that if you have a backbone you can withstand what is surely the most intense and concentrated program of hate ever directed at an american on october  roger cohen wrote in the new york times that donald trump is a phony liar blowhard cheat bully misogynist demagogue predator bigot bore egomaniac racist sexist sociopath and a dictatorinwaiting with a brats temper and a prigs scowl this must be one of the most unhinged hysterical outbursts in the history of american political journalism and it is unusual only for its wordiness not its tone 
dont the editors of the times realize that this kind of frothing explains why more americans believe in bigfoot  percent than trust newspapers  percent virtually the entire industry is so consumed with rage at donald trump and contempt for his supporters that it cannot control itself open petulant bias is driving more and more americans to social media and to sites like amrencom for their news 
despite the concerted shrieking of virtually the entire american ruling class donald trump is going to get close to half of the vote on november  some  million people are going to vote for a man for whom roger cohen has emptied his dictionary trying to insult only one major newspaper has endorsed donald trump only one  and this is a man whom the american people might choose as their president what better proof could we have of the stark difference between printed opinion and public opinion between what americans think and what our rulers want us to think donald trump has ripped away whatever was left of the pretense of media objectivity 
whether he wins or not whether he is one of us or not donald trump has laid bare the collusion between big media and a political system in which both parties collaborate to run the country in their interests and those of their big donors votersfinallyhave a chance to vote against the entire corrupt system on november th they could bring it crashing down but even if it still stands it is visibly weakened badly discredited these are the perfect conditions in which our ideas will flourish as never before",2016-10-28

seiwert rpretty prairie posted that comment and a longer followup on an antiblack meme that was originally posted to a prodonald trump facebook group and then shared by one of seiwerts constituents

seiwert said he didnt see the profanity in the meme when he commented and didnt do anything wrong 
i have a personal life besides a legislative life he said maybe it was inappropriate i dont believe so because i said nothing derogatory and i believe that if people are that upset with the national anthem they can do whatever they want to on their own time but when theyre using it on national tv to make a statement thats not right 
i said if she lawrence doesnt like it here then go where she would like it whats wrong with that he said 
asked why a person should leave rather than try to change things where they are seiwert responded because maybe theres other people who dont want their place changed 
he also said he did not think his comments had anything to do with race 
it dont make any difference if theyre black white or green its the disrespect to our country he said and why does everybody put the color to it

to many donald trumps pledge to build a wall along the usmexico border is unrealistic but for jim chilton its the only way hell get a good nights sleep 
the yearold a fifthgeneration rancher on the arizona border with mexico says he has grown weary of seeing drug smugglersrather than just cattleon his ranch and a wall is the answer to his troubles 
i really admire trump for having the insight and the knowledge to know whats wrong with the current border system he said as he surveyed the sprawling desert plains of his squaremile ranch that stretches to the mexican border 
we need a wall ive been saying that for  years    and we need roads along the boundary and the border patrol to be deployed there and not let anybody in he added it would make my life so much better and id feel more secure 
snip 
chilton who admits that trump was not his first choice among the republican candidates for the white house says building a barrier to secure the mile kilometer usmexico frontier not only makes sense but is also a question of national security 
snip 
i live in a nomans land i live in a land that is occupied by the sinaloa drug cartel he sighed pointing to mountains on his ranch where he said scouts equipped with sophisticated equipment are posted as lookouts for smugglers 
i have seen cartel scouts on these two mountains before    and even in my front yard he said i wave at them and they often yell hola and wave back 
chiltonwho keeps a gun holstered on his hip a rifle by his front door and a pistol by his bedsideadded that he and other ranchers are also in favor of beefed up security in remote border areas as extremist groups like islamic state is may be using them to slip operatives into the united states 
snip 
but beyond the drug cartels and threat of terrorism chilton insists that trumps wall is all the more necessary for humanitarian reasons 
its just outrageous for me to find a dead body on my ranch its outrageous for the border patrol to find a dead body and its outrageous for my cowboys he said referring to migrants who often die making the crossing into the us through the brutal desert 
this is as big a humanitarian issue as it is a national security issue

according to the us border patrol nearly  bodies have been recovered since  from the desert in the tucson arizona sector which covers  miles of the border

defiant dutch antiislam politician geert wilders said friday he will refuse to attend his hate speech trial next week dubbing it a travesty aimed at silencing him as the country prepares for  elections 
the trial opens on monday before a threejudge bench with the farright politician facing charges of insulting a racial group and inciting racial hatred for comments he made about moroccans living in the netherlands 
it is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country wilders said in a statement friday dubbing the case a political trial in which i refuse to cooperate 
it comes as opinion polls have shown his farright freedom party pvv doing well ahead of march elections 
after riding high amid the migrant crisis the party is now polling neckandneck with prime minister mark ruttes liberals each predicted to win between  to  seats in the seat parliament 
set to last until november  the trial focuses on a comment made at a march  rally when wilders asked supporters if they wanted fewer or more moroccans in your city and in the netherlands 
when the crowd shouted back fewer fewer wilders answered were going to organise that 
snip 
wilders said friday he would leave his defence in the hands of his lawyer geertjan knoops and instead go to work in the parliament in the hague 
snip 
judges earlier this month dismissed arguments by wilders lawyers that the trial was politically motivated adding they did not believe it will impact the pvvs election campaign 
politicians are granted broad freedoms of expression because of their official position the judges ruled last month 
precisely therefore politicians have an important role to avoid feeding intolerance by making these kind of public statements 
wilders hit back friday saying it is a travesty that i have to stand trial because i spoke about fewer moroccans 
millions of dutch citizens  percent of the population want fewer moroccans he claimed 
not because they despise all moroccans or want all moroccans out of the country but because they are sick and tired of the nuisance and terror caused by so many moroccans

its not a coincidence that it was white men of a certain age    certainly the majority of wilderness canoers are people who have a very privileged place in society theyre frequently highly educated people theyre almost completely white she said

call it the crisis of whiteness 
white anxiety has fueled this years political tumult in the west britains surprising vote to exit the european union donald j trumps unexpected capture of the republican presidential nomination in the united states the rise of rightwing nationalism in norway hungary austria and greece 
whiteness in this context is more than just skin color you could define it as membership in the ethnonational majority but thats a mouthful what it really means is the privilege of not being defined as other 
whiteness means being part of the group whose appearance traditions religion and even food are the default norm its being a person who by unspoken rules was long entitled as part of us instead of them 
snip 
its fundamentally about who are we said eric kaufmann a professor of politics at birkbeck college university of london what does it mean to be part of this nation is it not our nation anymore our meaning the ethnic majority 
these kinds of questions are really front and center even though theyre not necessarily verbalized 
the questions can seem like a sudden reversal after decades of rising multiculturalism through the civil rights movement in the united states and the european unions opening up of borders 
snip 
white peoples officially privileged status waned over the latter half of the th century with the demise of discriminatory practices in say university admissions but rising wages an expanding social safety net and new educational opportunities helped offset that most white adults were wealthier and more successful than their parents and confident that their children would do better still 
that feeling of success may have provided a sort of identity in itself 
but as western manufacturing and industry have declined taking many workingclass towns with them parents and grandparents have found that the opportunities they once had are unavailable to the next generation 
that creates an identity vacuum to be filled 
for someone who is lower income or lower class professor kaufmann explained youre going to get more selfesteem out of a communal identity such as ethnicity or the nation than you would out of any sort of achieved identity 
snip 
a recent gallup study found that mr trumps supporters tend to earn aboveaverage incomes for their communities but also tend to live in majoritywhite areas where children are likely to be worse off than their parents 
snip 
the formal rejection of racial discrimination in those societies has by extension constructed a new broader national identity the united states has a black president london has a muslim mayor of pakistani descent 
but that broadening can to some feel like a painful loss articulated in the demand voiced over and over at trump rallies probrexit events and gatherings for populist parties throughout europe i want my country back 
the mantra is not all about bigotry rather being part of a culture designed around peoples own community and customs is a constant background hum of reassurance of belonging 
the loss of that comforting hum has accelerated a phenomenon that robin diangelo a lecturer and author calls white fragilitythe stress white people feel when they confront the knowledge that they are neither special nor the default that whiteness is just a race like any other 
fragility leads to feelings of insecurity defensiveness even threat and it can trigger a backlash against those who are perceived as outsiders 
snip 
for decades the language of white identity has only existed in the context of white supremacy when that became taboo it left white identity politics without a vocabulary 
if you are a workingclass white person and you fear that the new cosmopolitan world will destroy or diminish an identity you cherish you have no culturally acceptable way to articulate what you perceive as a crisis 
some of these people have instead reached for issues that feel close to their concerns trade crime the war on drugs controlling the borders fear of islamist terrorism all are significant in their own right and create very real fears for many people but they have also become a means to have a public conversation about what societys changes mean for white majorities 
snip 
there will not likely be a return to the whiteness of social dominance and exclusive national identity immigration cannot be halted without damaging western nations economies immigrants who have already arrived cannot be expelled en masse without causing social and moral damage and the other groups who seem to be cutting in line are in fact getting a chance at progress that was long denied them 
western whites have a place within their nations new broader national identities but unless they accept it the crisis of whiteness seems likely to continue",2016-10-29

but in florida which extended early voting after long lines left some voters waiting for hours in  africanamericans share of the electorate that has gone to the polls in person so far has decreased  to  percent today from  percent four years ago

369,black turnout soft in early voting boding ill for hillary clinton,"loading posted on november   this professor devotes her life to countering dangerous speech she cant ignore donald trumps colby itkowitz washington post october   
when susan benesch began looking at how speech could incite mass violence her research took her to farflung places like kenya and burma 
lately shes been unable to ignore a case study at home in the united states 
the american university law professor and harvard university faculty associate has grappled for months with whether donald trumps rhetoric constitutes dangerous speech as she has come to define it she has examined electionyear speech before but only abroad where the risks of mass atrocities were great 
but in the past week with trump claiming that the election system and the media are rigged against him his messages have the type of undertone that increases the risk of violence between groups she said 
benesch  has dedicated the past six years of her life to developing and testing a framework for identifying dangerous speech to rise to that level at least two of these five indicators must be true a powerful speaker with a high degree of influence over the audience the audience has grievances and fears that the speaker can cultivate a speech act that is clearly understood as a call to violence a social or historical context that is propitious for violence for any of a variety of reasons including longstanding competition between groups for resources lack of efforts to solve grievances or previous episodes of violence a means of dissemination that is influential in itself for example because it is the sole or primary source of news for the relevan t audience 
trumps speech is very difficult in the sense that he is so often slippery with it benesch said in a recent interview the meaning is so often ambiguous 
but when trump said his supporters could use the second amendment against hillary clinton it seems to me impossible that people didnt understand that as a reference to violence she said or when he suggested that clinton and president obama were founders of the islamic state something he alluded to again at wednesdays final debate that was a hallmark of dangerous speech to describe an ingroup member as the enemy she said 
and now with trump trafficking in the conspiracy theory that if he loses the election it will be because of a rigged system against him hes definitely laying the groundwork for potential unrest after the balloting direct incitement of violence is illegal but trump falls short of actually calling for any kind of civil disobedience 
because of that its still a gray area that surrounds whether trump does use dangerous speech 
trump may well be undermining the extent to which his supporters trust the essential institutions and practices of us democracy benesch said some of themthose who are most susceptible to being inflamed by such messagesmay therefore be more likely to commit violence however the united states is not in danger of mass intergroup violence in my view it is deeply irresponsible though since it can undermine some americans belief in our own democratic institutions which can make them more susceptible to dangerous speech going forward

the recent case involving a firstgeneration latina student  tiffany martínez at suffolk university is but one example an accomplished undergraduate published journal author and mcnair scholar martínez wrote a personal blog post titled academia love me back in her heartfelt plea martínez first recounts an experience she described as both disrespectful and invalidating and then explains that a sociology professor accused her of plagiarism not privately but in front of the entire class the professors claim was further illustrated by emphatic written statements on her paper such as this is not your word and please go back and indicate where you cut and paste

for president obama uncontrolled migration into europe is a major national security issue for the united states even the dalai lama agrees that there are too many refugees inside the european union 
really too many historic consider these facts more than  million people were forced from their homes by conflict or persecution in  according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr  including  million people classified as refugees living outside the borders of their own countries 
admittedly a record  million refugees sought asylum within the european union last year with thousands more applying for asylum every month yet what of subsaharan africa home to  million refugees and a whopping  million people of concern to the un high commissioner for refugees 
we dont often hear about these particular refugees or asylumseekers do we they are to borrow a term from british historian mark curtis unpeople the poor nonwhite residents of the developing world who tend to be ignored by the western media 
where is the rolling coverage of kenyas dadaab camp for example dadaab is the largest refugee camp in the world but in a move that could displace as many as  people  kenyan authorities are in the process of closing it down it puts the recent british media frenzy over the socalled jungle camp in calais france with its  migrants into some perspective doesnt it

vladimir putin has waded into the migrant crisis condemning europes handling of asylum seekers and saying a case of child rape in austria dilutes national values 
the russian president has largely kept quiet over the refugee crisis in europe but has now spoken out of his disbelief over its handling claiming that a continent that cant protect its children has no future 
his comments come off the back of a case in austria last week which saw an iraqi migrant have his conviction of raping a yearold boy at a swimming pool in vienna overturned 
he was originally convicted of the crime but it was overturned because a court didnt prove he realised the boy was saying no 
it came after the migrant identified as yearold amir a claimed that it was a sexual emergency because he had not had sex for four months 
a second trial for the rape is expected to take place next year but the attacker is likely to remain in custody until then 
and speaking at a press conference this week putin slammed europes migration policy and cited the case where the victim was from a serbian family living in austria 
he said in a european country a child is raped by a migrant and the court releases him 
it doesnt fit into my head what on earth theyre thinking over there 
i cant even explain the rationaleis it a sense of guilt before the migrants whats going on its not clear 
he also claimed that the case highlighted the dissolution of traditional national values adding a society that cannot defend its children has no future 
and putins words appeared to have struck a chord as he is extremely popular with serbs 
in the rape case the boy had arrived in austria with his serbian mother who paid for him to go to the theresienbad swimming pool where he was violently attacked 
the boy was so badly injured that he needed hospital treatment but he will be forced to go back to court for the iraqi mans second trial outraging the austrian serbian community 
austrian media say the case has hardened the communities position against asylum seekers who were previously divided about whether to vote for the leftleaning green party candidate or the far right option nobert hofer in upcoming elections

in march konstantin romodanovsky head of russias federal migration service accused leaders of willfully ignoring cultural differences that have caused such widespread friction and chaos across the continent 
he also added that multiculturalism has failed because europe never formed a unified strategy to integrate refugees into western society 
he said the european commission left it up to individual nations to decide how they want to treat asylum seekersdespite the fact the policies and capabilities of member states are very different

the year is  dodging a flurry of spears the boer commander andries pretorius rides forward to seize a zulu warrior in the midst of an epic battle between more than  warriors and just  boers pretorius has decided to take a zulu alive he wants to send the captive back to his king dingaan to convey surrender terms to the zulu nation 
the warrior has no intention of being taken alive and jabs viciously at pretorius with his assegai this is a zulu spear normally a longshafted throwing weapon but the warrior broke its shank earlier for closequarter stabbing pretorius gives up on capturing the zulu and tries to shoot him 
with a singleshot muzzleloading musket he has only one chance of a hit there is no time to reload in close combat to his horror pretorius sees the smoketrailing ball whiz past the zulus ear at the same time the zulu lunges forward causing pretoriuss horse to stumble backwards throwing the white commander to the ground 
leaping to his feet he meets the attacking zulu who knows he is now on equal terms with the white man who can no longer use his magic shooting stick and carries no weapon comparable to the assegai pretorius is now fighting for his life he just manages to sidestep the spear point striking it away with the butt of his gun 
spinning round the zulu raises his spear high above his head and thrusts down as he has been trained to do in the zulus disciplined army it is a blow that will be fatal if it strikes home but pretorius sees it coming he grabs the spear point with his left hand to ward it away from his chest the sharp point cuts deeply into his palm embedding itself at an angle that makes it impossible for the zulu to pull it out pretorius seizes the zulu by the throat with his free right hand and throws him to the ground in an attempt to strangle him 
the zulu struggles and with the help of two good hands is about to break free when one of pretoriuss men comes upon the scene he pulls the assegai out of the commanders hand and plunges it into the zulus side ending the struggle 
pretorius remounts and heads back to the boer camp for treatment he is not worried as he knows by now that this greatest of all battles between boers and zulus has already been won the main zulu army has been broken in two and the river that runs along one side of the boer camp is stained red with zulu blood the place and the tributary known previously as the ncome will be renamed blood river pretorius knows that the zulu defeat which will include some  killed on the battlefield is a fit revenge for the deception and murder committed by the zulus  months earlier 
prelude to war 
the great clash between the boer and zulu nations was not as leftist historians like to claim the result of ruthless white colonialism suppressing an indigenous people it came about because the zulus rejected an extremely reasonable attempt at negotiation by the boers 
the boers pioneers of dutch french and german descent were the people who opened up much of what was later to become south africa their first antecedents had landed on the southernmost tip of africa in  only  years after the virginia company settled on jamestown island 
when they arrived in the area now known as cape town whites came into contact only with hottentots and bushmen as the number of europeans increased they expanded east and north only meeting their first black tribe the xhosa some  miles away on south africas east coast the xhosas were migrating south fleeing the warlike zulu to the north who were engaged in imperialist expansion of their own 
for just under a century white settlement halted at this eastern frontier border formed by the coast and firm xhosa settlement it was not however a time of peace as xhosa were constantly raiding the boers who lived on the border this caused much harm and discontent among the farmers who blamed the dutchruled colonial government back in cape town for the lawlessness 
it only added to the border farmers grievances when the british took the cape colony from the dutch in  to prevent the colony from falling into french hands during the napoleonic wars it was vital to control the merchant and naval refitting station on the way to the far east the new colonial masters not only started anglicizing the colony when they abolished slavery they offered compensation that amounted to hardly a quarter of a slaves value 
exasperated by incessant xhosa attacks and british attempts to suppress their language and culture groups of frontier farmers filled with a sense of manifest destiny not seen again until the opening of the american west set forth to the north and the east in a movement known as the great trek the trekkers they became known as voortrekkers or pioneers only after  bypassed the xhosa in search of new unsettled territory in which they could establish independent boer nations all told it was only a small minority of no more than  boers who made the trek to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions they traveled in several waves of covered oxdrawn wagons much like the conestogas in which americans opened the west 
the boer leader of the time piet retief had written the trekker manifesto in which he spelled out the farmers longheld grievances against the british by the boer wagons had crossed the great mountain range into natal in an act of audacity that few thought possible the range the highest in southern africa had been named the drakensbergthe dragon mountainsbecause they were said to be impassable 
retief had identified a large piece of uninhabited land to the north of the zulu kingdom which lay open to settlement retief knew that if he wanted the land for his people he could take it unopposed however he wanted to live in peace with his zulu neighbors and before taking possession he opened negotiations with the zulu king dingaan he wanted no misunderstanding between the two peoples 
he sent a letter to the zulu king explaining why he wanted to speak to him and first visited dingaans capitala large circle of reed and grass hutson november   retief left the main body of trekkers and went to the zulu kings capital umgungundhlovo the place of the elephant to negotiate a treaty that would allow boers peacefully to settle land adjoining the zulu kingdom dingaan said he would let the boers live in natal if they recovered cattle stolen by a tlokwa chieftain retief and his men did so and dingaan agreed to give the land to the boers 
retief returned to umgungundhlovo on february   to finalize the agreement he arrived with  volunteers including his own son and three children of other menit was common for children to accompany their fathers on expeditions of this kind the next day retief and dingaan formally signed a treatythe zulu king made his mark by scratching an x on the documentgiving possession of the land to the boers delighted the boers sent scouts back to the main encampments to report the successful outcome and made ready to leave as retief and his party were about to saddle up a messenger arrived from dingaan inviting the boer party to a special celebration to mark the signing retief was suspicious but did not want to offend dingaan as they had on previous visits the boers stacked their firearms neatly outside the reed walls and entered the royal enclosure unarmed 
as they ate and drank a zulu impi or warrior unit put on a dance for the guests according to the account of a white missionary who was present the dancing warriors drew ever closer to the boers till they were just in front of the seated whites when the zulu king leaped to his feet and shouted kill the white wizards the impi fell upon the surprised boers some of them drew their hunting knives and tried to fight off the attackers but they were quickly overwhelmed 
the zulu warriors bound the whites with reed ropes and dragged them to hlomo amabutho the hill of execution near the zulu capital there they clubbed the boers to death one by one with retief kept until last and forced to watch his son being murdered after retiefs heart was extracted and presented to dingaan as proof that the boer leader was dead the bodies were left for the vultures in accordance with zulu custom 
dingaan then gave orders for the full might of his army to attack the boer camps the settlers had received the message retief had sent earlier and believed everything had gone well they were therefore completely unprepared and badly undermanned the  men in retiefs party were all dead many other men had gone hunting leaving only a light guard for the women and children the boers were so confident there would be peace that they had not even posted sentries just before dawn barking dogs aroused the outlying wagons then thousands of zulu warriors attacked the several hundred trekkers  women children and old men  as they lay sleeping 
the boer historian gustav preller who interviewed survivors left a harrowing account of the aftermath all around dozens and dozens of bodies  babies who had had their heads smashed open against the wagon wheels women dishonored and in some zulu custom their breasts cut off  in a wagon blood filled to a height of several inches the life blood of an entire family ebbed out where they lay  jan bezuidenhout one of the few young men who had not gone ahead with the retief party grabbed his fourmonthold baby daughter out of her crib and ran off through the undergrowth  having lost his pursuers a few miles away bezuidenhout checked for the first time on his daughter in his arms she was dead a single spear stroke had killed her 
the slaughter became known as the weenen the dutch word for weeping and a town of that name still stands near the site of the  boers camped in the area zulus killed some  including  children the rest survived because grazing requirements for their animals meant that the boer camps had to be widely dispersed if dingaans men had scouted more thoroughly found all the encampments and attacked them simultaneously the slaughter would have been far greater 
pretorius arrives 
the boers now faced their greatest challenge their camps were full of wounded men orphaned children and widows the zulus had stolen an estimated  head of cattle and sheep during the weenen slaughter and ammunition was running low the zulu armies might return at any time and they were a formidable force as the boers discovered when they launched a raid to avenge the massacre on april    trekkers under a divided command of piet uys and hendrik potgieter rode into zulu territory only to be defeated by some  warriors not far from umgungundhlovo in what became known as the battle of italeni 
this new disaster forced the boers to face reality they had to either abandon their quest for independence and return to the cape colony or find some means to fight their way through the widows and orphans argued strongly for pushing on they knew that if they fell back to the cape they would have to live on charity whereas if dingaan could be defeated they could at least recover their livestock many boers were also convinced that god favored them and that setbacks were only a test of faith 
it was at this moment of indecision that a popular lawyer named andries pretorius answered the trekker call for reinforcements and rode into camp with  men and a brass cannon the boers appointed him commander in chief on november  and he immediately began preparing a strike against the zulu 
his means were few a force of only about  boers including three scotsmen set out on november  seeking battle for extra protection the boer column of  wagons traveled four abreast instead of the usual single file each night they formed a circular defensive formation known as a laager 
pretorius realized that even with two frontloading cannon his force was too weak to defeat the zulu army in an open field he therefore decided to draw the enemy into an attack on the boer encampment each day patrols and scouting parties rode ahead sometimes led by pretorius himself to make sure no unexpected surprises were waiting over the horizon 
on december   the boer party reached the zandspruit tributary of the waschbank river it was here that the boer chaplain sarel cilliers first pledged during his nightly sermon that if god helped them defeat the zulus they and their descendents would celebrate that day in honor of god and that they would build a church in commemoration the boers repeated this oath known in afrikaner folklore as the covenant every night until they met the enemy 
there appeared to be no movement from the zulu side on december  pretorius decided to move camp to the buffalo river hoping to provoke the zulus by moving farther into their territory that day he sent out two patrols one under the command of his deputy commandant hans de lange and another under the scotsman edward parker this latter group saw action when they came upon a small group of zulus they killed the warriors and took the women prisoner 
pretorius drew up a message for dingaan on a white cloth explaining that he was leading a commando to punish the zulus if however dingaan was willing to cooperate pretorius wrote he was still willing to make peacea generous offer in light of the earlier betrayal he freed the prisoners and told them to give the message to dingaan he received no answer 
on december  the boers spotted zulus and what appeared to be a large number of cattle near their camp piet uys had been tricked by such a ploy at the battle of italeni zulu warriors crouching behind toughened animalskin shields looked like cattle from a distance and uys dropped his guard he was killed in a surprise attack by the cattle 
pretorius did not make the same mistake and he sent a strong mounted unit to investigate the cattle they turned out to be zulus and in the short fight that followed the boers killed eight warriors but suffered no casualties pretorius now suspected that the zulus were preparing for battle 
on december  he moved the boer camp to a position alongside the ncome river itself a tributary of the buffalo river a scouting expedition that day confirmed the presence of two huge zulu armies a short distance away 
pretorius prepared for battle his men drew the wagons into a dshaped formation one side overlooking a large hippopotamus path facing the ncome river another side facing a soil erosion ditch and the third side facing the open plain pretorius chose the site to limit the directions from which the zulus could attack 
the laager was large enough to contain all the horses and oxen the defenders tied the wagons together with leather ropes and closed off all openings between and below the wagons with a pretorius innovation socalled fighting gates which were slatted wood fixtures through which defenders could fire they left two small openings sealed with removable fighting gates so cavalry could leave the laager finally they attached lanterns to the ends of large oxwhips planted upright in the ground these dangled in front of the laager and were to serve as forward lighting during the dark hours when zulu usually attacked zulus captured after the battle said they had believed the lights waving in the breeze above the boer camp were spirits and that fear of the spirits kept them from attacking that night 
battle is joined 
in pretoriuss own account of the battle he wrote that as the mist cleared on the morning of december  he saw that the boer camp was completely encircled by tens of thousands of zulu warriors even where the terrain would have made an attack difficult estimates placed the number of zulus at between  and  although no official count was possible whatever the figure pretorius wrote that it was a terrible sight 
the boers had been ready and armed since two hours before daybreak the two cannon were in position and the fighting gates closed the defenders expected to run out of ammunition for the cannon and had stacked up suitably sized stones at strategic points along the perimeter to fire as a last resort the boers would fire stones that day 
the front lines of the zulu force were still squatting only about  paces from the wagons waiting for the signal to attack pretorius decided to strike first at his signal three bursts of fire from the boer guns and two blasts from the cannon broke the silence the boers orders were to then hold their fire as the billows of gunpowder smoke lifted they saw that the surviving zulus had fled some  paces from their former front line leaving behind dozens of dying and dead comrades 
the boers then heard the noise of the zulus breaking their spear shafts to make them into short stabbing weapons a frontal assault was coming a few minutes later the zulu force stormed the wagons screaming wildly shields held high and assegais in readiness withering gunfire ripped through the zulu ranks and while some managed to reach the wagons they were gunned down before they could cut through the wagon canvasses 
another group of zulus tried to attack from inside the erosion ditch by standing on each others shoulders and scrambling over the edge pretorius ordered cilliers the fighting churchman to see off the attack he led a group of men out of the relative safety of the wagon perimeter and they proceeded to kill some  zulus one boer philip fourie was wounded when an assegai struck him in the side 
the boers then wheeled one of their cannon out of the laager pointed it into the ditch and fired a shot that literally blew apart the assaulting party the survivors fled the ditch in disarray this sparked a temporary retreat by the zulu and marked the end of the second unsuccessful attempt to break the boer lines the wounded boer fourie returned to the wagon circle for treatment 
as the zulus waited for new orders pretorius ordered another burst of cannon fire into their ranks provoking a spontaneous charge against the wagons although it was the longest single assault of the ninehour battle it was utterly defeated as the boers cut down wave after wave of attackers gun barrels got so hot men had to hold them with wet cloths for reloading 
as the third attack fell back the boers launched their first surprise counterattack as the mobile fighting gates swung open and a cavalry unit charged the zulu lines shooting from the saddle the boers tried to turn the zulu lines to their left desperate zulu resistance which saw hundreds more of their number killed stopped the encircling action and the boer horsemen rode back to the wagons they regrouped and launched a second attempt driving the zulus further away a third mounted charge finally broke through the zulu lines the boer cavalry then turned and attacked the zulus from the rear pinned between the cavalry and cannon fire from within the wagon circle the main zulu force facing the open plain scattered 
a reserve zulu force tried to cross the ncome river to attack the laager but so many warriors were gunned down that their blood stained the water red pretorius himself then led another cavalry charge from within the laager cut to pieces with thousands dead the zulu army which had courageously charged repeatedly against a betterarmed enemy finally broke ranks and fled 
pretorius divided his cavalry into two units and sent them in pursuit mounted boers killed hundreds of warriors during a threehour chase it was during this pursuit that pretorius was wounded two other boers including fourie suffered nonfatal assegai wounds but these were the only boer casualties an estimated  zulus died on the battlefield and many more died later from wounds 
the aftermath 
early the next morning pretorius ordered the camp broken and marched the commando straight to the zulu kings capital he was confident the zulus no longer posed any significant threat but he hardly expected the sight that awaited him on december  at umgungundhlovo dingaan had fled with his wives and cattle leaving the circular camp of reed huts burning as a symbol of the destruction of zulu power 
on the outskirts of the capital the boers found the skeletons of retief and his men their hands and feet were still bound fast with thongs of ox hide wrote cilliers and in nearly all the corpses a spike as thick as an arm had been forced into the anus so that the point of the spike was in the chest retief who was identified by the remains of a satin vest he had worn still had a leather bag draped over his shoulder bone in it was the treaty signed by dingaan giving the boers the unoccupied land to the north according to one of the boers who saw it the treaty was astonishingly well preservedas if it had been left in a closed box pretoriuss men buried retief and his party on christmas day  
dingaan fled north but was captured by a rival tribe the swazis earlier he had persecuted the swazis and they murdered him in revenge the new zulu king mpande was officially installed in  and confirmed the contents of the treaty with the boers who established their first republic in southern africa also in  in fulfillment of their covenant the boers built a church to mark the blood river victory 
the battle of blood river entered the afrikaner psyche as a divinelyinspired victory and december  became a public holiday in south africa celebrated each year with festivals church services and reenactments the battle represented the victory of european civilization over the darkness of africa of christianity over heathens it helped justify white supremacy and the selfappointed right of afrikaners to rule over not apart from the black tribes 
yet the battle of blood river in many ways symbolized all that was wrong with the white settlement of southern africa and why that experiment failed the boers are to be praised for wanting to settle unoccupied land peacefully and for seeking the friendship of neighboring peoples but neither they nor their descendents understood that demography is the arbiter of nations those who form the majority population of a territory will rule that territory no matter how powerful a ruling elite may be they will determine its culture and society a majorityeuropean population will create a society that reflects european values and norms a majorityafrican population will create a society that reflects african norms 
the boers never understood this even at the battle of blood river they had at least  black servants and an indeterminate number of mixedrace servants who helped load weapons parker one of the scotsman had more than  black servants 
to the present day the overwhelming majority of afrikaners have black servants who work on farms in factories and in homes afrikaners failed to understand that by giving the native population the benefits of european civilization blacks would grow in numbers and overwhelm their society the cape colony and the original boer republics which were largely uninhabited by natives when they were settled by europeans are today home to tens of millions of africans 
the church of the vow built by the boers in  still stands in the town of pietermaritzburg named after piet retief but pietermaritzburg supposedly the symbol of the boer victory over the zulus is today part of a municipality called umgungundhlovo named after dingaans capital it is also the capital of the south african province of kwazulu natal and its population is more than  percent black 
the church of the vow stands alone graffitiscarred and abandoned in a dirty downtown slum its decay illustrates the fatal error made by the victors of the battle of blood river that of ignoring the demographics of race if whites had taken possession of those unoccupied lands and kept them for themselves alone the history of south africa would have been entirely different 
if the boers had inhabited and worked their own land rather than rely on black labor the states they created might still be strong and independent today their decision to use nonwhite labor was a critical error that undid all of the sacrifices of the early pioneers 
the only way to maintain a civilization is for the majority to occupy its own land with its own people and to do its own manual labor this law governs the rise and fall of civilizations and the victors of blood river ignored it to their cost",2016-11-04

this accusation may seem ludicrous since sen sanders surrendered his stage to black lives matter activists several times but in comparison to mrs clinton mr thrasher was right about sen sanders no mainstream candidate in the history of the united states has more thoroughly debased himself in the quest for the black vote than mrs clinton since this helped her win the democratic nomination she has continued the strategy in the few days remaining before november th lets take a look at hillary clintons most ethnomasochistic moments 
 in january of  mrs clinton was at something called the iowa brown and black forum with none other than jorge ramos  where she was asked can you tell us what the term white privilege means to you and can you give me an example from your life or career when you think you have benefitted from it this is how she began her answer 
where do i start i think it is hard when you are swimming in the ocean to know exactly what is happening around you so much as it is when youre standing on the shore perhaps watching     i was born white middleclass in the middle of america    
 early in the democratic nomination mrs clintons campaign released a memo aimed at stifling the rising momentum of bernie sanders 
whereas the electorates in iowa and new hampshire are largely ruralsuburban and predominantly white the march primary states better reflect the true diversity of the democratic party and the nation     it will be very difficult if not impossible for a democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among african american and hispanic voters we believe thats how it should be emphasis added 
 shortly before the south carolina primary at schomburg center for research in black culture in harlem mrs clinton explained how to break down barriers for african americans 
ending systemic racism requires contributions from all of usespecially those of us who havent experienced it ourselves white americans need to do a better job of listening when african americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers that you face every day 
we need to recognize our privilege and practice humility rather than assume that our experiences are everyones experiences all of us need to bring our skills to bearand especially young people coming up today who have a passion for social justice and are helping to create new ways to solve intractable problems 
 in april of  while on a back radio show mrs clinton was asked what she always carries in her bag she immediately answered hot sauce when one of the black hosts noted that she would be accused of pandering to black people for giving that answer she asked hopeully is it working 
 just a few weeks after a black lives matter supporter murdered five police officers  the democratic national convention that convened to nominate mrs clinton passed a resolution no doubt with her approval supporting black lives matter  
the dnc joins with americans across the country in affirming black lives matter and the say her name efforts to make visible the pain of our fellow and sister americans as they condemn extrajudicial killings of unarmed african american men women and children 
white politicians have tried to win elections through public displays of ethnomasochism for decades but this election has set a new low and if mrs clinton loses her pandering could live on in another form as the black lives matter activist tef poe explained  if mr trump wins young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go    aint no more rules weve been too nice as is",2016-11-04
378,when the river ran red,"why obama will win jared taylor american renaissance august  
it is time to get used to the idea that the next president of the united states will be black why will a nation we are so often assured is racist elect a black president and will it make a difference 
ever since hillary clinton dropped out of the race the polls have reported consistently that barack obama will beat john mccain the media love to tell us that whites say they support the black candidate and then vote for the white but there is no reason for whites to lie in this campaign mr obama will not get a majority of the white vote but he will get enough to beat mr mccain why will so many whites vote for mr obama 
first some support his policies they want to end the war in iraq and they want the standard liberal program of socialized medicine higher taxes more handouts and more government there has always been a substantial minority of whites who vote this way and they have a clear favorite in mr obama 
second as many people have pointed out an enormous number of whites think it is deeply virtuous to vote for a blacknot for an outandout race man such as jesse jackson or al sharpton but for an unthreatening wellscrubbed black who speaks standard english and promises to bring us together even if they live sharply segregated lives whites thrill to the language of coming together and they adore blacks who dont act or sound black 
for many whites voting for mr obama will be an act of high patriotism electing him will prove america is not racist and many whites believe that rising above racism is americas sacred calling one must never underestimate the importance to whites of feeling virtuous most would rather lose a leg than be thought a bigot and a vote for obama is a painless way to burnish antiracist credentials 
third young whites will line up for mr obama they have been swallowing antiwhite multiculti propaganda all their lives and have not knocked around enough to discover it is false some who know their parents will vote for mr mccain will make a special point of voting for mr obama every new generation thinks it is cooler hipper and wiser than any generation that ever lived and what could be cooler hipper or wiser than putting a black man in the white house for many young whites a vote for mr obama will be a denial of every uncool unhip and especially every even faintly racerealist thing their parents ever said or did 
fourth although the country seems to have a collective memory of no more than two weeks americans think everything is historic whenever someone breaks an obscure record in professional baseball we are told history was made if you ask someone why he waited in line all night to buy the first apple iphone he will tell you its a historic product americans love anything that is historic and for people who think a few more stolen bases are history right up there with the battle of lepanto putting a black man in the white house will be the discovery of america pearl harbor and the second coming all rolled into one many whites will vote for mr obama because they want to think they helped make history 
the media which has its own grim reasons for supporting mr obama is mesmerized by the same prospect editors salivate at the thought of writing headlines like history is made the day after the election and some will lose all selfcontrol and add an exclamation mark the emphasis of course will be on mr obama as the first black president implying more to come the media which always subtly boost the democrat will be even more blatantly partisan this time downplaying every blunder mr obama makes and highlighting mr mccains 
fifth many whites will vote for mr obamaor at least not vote for mr mccainbecause the republicans have nominated the most stunningly unattractive candidate in years old and pockmarked mr mccain is thoroughly disliked in the senate for arrogance that he cannot even hide from voters when he is not speaking from notes he has dismayed republicans by promoting amnesty for illegals and dismayed everyone else by saying america should stay in iraq for  years if it takes that long to win mr obama therefore has the enormous advantage of running against an opponent that not even republicans like 
mr obama will also crush mr mccain in facetoface debates mr mccain cannot put an unscripted sentence together any better than george w bush can and will come across as a thickwitted geezer mr obama who is as glib as any politician gives credence to hl menckens definition of democracy as rule by orators 
but what about americas storied racism isnt america brimming with people who cant bear the thought of a black president americans have been numbed for decades by attractive televisionblacks who read the news forecast the weather and tell us which brand of toothpaste to buy americans get a steady diet of heroic movieblacks who outsmart and beat up white brutes solve baffling technical problems dispense sage advice and save the world even the current miss usa is black there are millions of whites who do not want to live with blacks or have much to do with them but would a black president be much different from nearly eight years of black secretaries of state the march of blackness may be vaguely worrying to whites but they think there is nothing they can do about it and that they shouldnt even if they could 
the final reason why whites will vote for mr obama is that the republicans do not have the backbone to attack him in the only way that would work if they were serious they would fill the airways with jeremiah wright prancing and raving along with the message this is the man who married mr and mrs obama baptized their children and whom mr obama calls a family member they would buy radio ads quoting michelle obamas thesis in which she says she will always be black first and american second mr mccain has nothing like the stomach for a campaign like this 
many blacks probably think he has the stomach for considerably worse  percent think mr obama is in greater physical danger than any white politician and many say they would have warned him not to run for fear he would be killed an assassination would certainly be a shattering event there is no telling how many cities would go up in flames and thirdworld countries which have followed the obama nomination with unprecedented interest would help make it the most widely reported killing in history i have just returned from a muslim country in which everyone has heard of mr obama and likes him but most have never heard of john mccain whatever gruesome fantasies blacks may be spinning however assassination has gone out of style in america and white resistancesuch as it isis dependably nonviolent mr obama will be perfectly safe 
in any case mr obama will win far more white votes than he will lose because he is black whites who dont want a black president would not vote for a democrat anyway as for black voters even nominal republicans are said to be running for the doors but strictly racial voting has always been fine for blacks not so for whites of course just try telling your coworkers that you disagree with mr mccain but are voting for him because he is white 
racially conscious whites will be in a quandary in november even if mr mccains policies are worse than mr obamas should they vote for the white manone with an adopted bangladeshi daughter and who long ago betrayed white interests even after years of being softened up with black heroes and figureheads a black in the white house is a powerful symbol of white dispossession a mulatto president is an almost explicit endorsement of miscegenation this is bitter medicine 
some whites have argued that a black president would undercut the charges of racism whites are forever facing but they are dreaming the entire government could look like a meeting of the mystic knights of the sea but as long as blacks are worse off than whites we will be blamed for it sensible whites cannot cheerfully vote for either man i suspect most will stay home or vote for a minor candidate 
aside from the symbolic impact which cannot be calculated will president obama be much different from a president hillary clinton she would lard her cabinet with blacks and hispanics nominate ultraliberal judges push for amnesty grovel before nonwhites everywhere and load up the civil rights division of the justice department with antiwhite sharks she would certainly make a bigger fool of herself over hispanics and asians see  turning up the pressure  ar may  our choice therefore could not be more disagreeable on balance we get to decide which is the more degrading spectacle deluded white people giving their country away or cleareyed blacks helping themselves to it 
president obama will however face special pressures he cant let the pushier brothers walk all over him but he will have to throw them enough bones to keep them off his back it will be a tricky balance mr obamas first annual address to the naacp will be a love feast but every year after that it will be harder to explain why black unemployment poverty and incarceration rates havent changed at all 
even mr obamas starstruck white supporters will eventually wonder what happened to all that change he promised there is not going to be change the system is far too stuck in its selfserving ways for that with the help of an enlarged democratic majority in congress mr obama may set up some wheezing byzantine form of socialized medicine but no one will be happy with it if mr obama inherits a sick economy a weak dollar expensive oil and shrinking revenues americans will not at all like the change they get 
on the bright side with mr obama we have a good chance of piquant firstlady behavior what will the white house be like with michelle in charge will she want a new exterior paint job how and whom will she entertain will the big mans guest bedroomsin the african traditionbe turned over to third cousins from kenya and the south side of chicago there is no telling with what improprieties large and small mrs obama will entertain us as she makes up her mind whether she is an american 
it will be an edifying presidency and whites may be a little less deluded in ",2016-11-06

385,california set to let public schools teach primarily in spanish,"new las vegas casino only for chinese gamblers  
los angeles times 
casino operators know there are no gamblers quite like the chinese 
with their affinity for baccarat the most lucrative game in las vegas chinese gamblers have long commanded special treatment  be it with private chinese gaming salons lunar new year festivities or performances from pop stars flown in from hong kong and taiwan 
no one in las vegas however has built a casino and hotel strictly for chinese visitors until now 
the lucky dragon hotel  casino is billing itself as las vegas first asianthemed resort funded in large part by chinese investors the property set to open dec  with a traditional lion dance will offer bilingual staff and signage a luxury tea bar and a host of restaurants with food that wouldnt look or taste out of place in guangzhou or shanghai 
no general tsos or egg rolls here said david jacoby chief operating officer for the resort which left no chinese superstition unturned 
the rosecolored resorts front entrance is designed in a dragon motif a feng shui master blessed its kitchens the main bar is eightsided for good fortune and its hard to find a no  on the property the unlucky digit is absent from room numbers and the phone directory the ninestory hotel even skips a fourth floor 
this place is heavily feng shuied jacoby said 
with all that attention to detail youd think lucky dragons brain trust was born in beijing but the idea behind the room boutique resort off the northern end of the las vegas strip was largely conceived by an american veteran gaming executive bill weidner the former president and chief operating officer of las vegas sands corp 
weidner an advisor to lucky dragon is no neophyte to the chinese market he worked with some of chinas most powerful government figures to lead sands expansion into macau when the former portuguese colony relaxed its monopoly on gaming licenses in  macau now generates nearly five times the gambling revenue of the las vegas strip forever changing the fortunes of the global casino industry 
weidner was also involved in the development of the billion marina bay sands in singapore before leaving the company in a bitter dispute in  
weidner and jacoby know major las vegas gaming resorts like the sands venetian mgm or wynn already cater to chinas high rollers with vip parlors and relationships forged in macau 
lucky dragon though tiny compared with those properties addresses what they see as a gap in the market middleclass chinese gamblers chinese americans as well as the broader asian american community 
let them fight over the  and let us fight over the remaining  said jacoby who previously worked for weidners firm global gaming asset management opening a casino resort in the philippines 
that pool of chinese gamers will almost certainly grow on dec  hainan airlines will fly the first direct flights from china to las vegass mccarran international airport lucky dragon guests are confirmed to be on that flight jacoby said 
already a record  visitors from china traveled to las vegas last year nearly double the number in  according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority 
meanwhile ground was broken on another asianthemed resort this one much bigger than lucky dragon resorts world a malaysian hospitality and casino giant with decades of asian gaming experience is spending up to  billion for a room property on the north strip that will feature chinese architecture such as an ersatz great wall its slated to open in  
plans are also underway to build a billion resort on the strip called alon las vegas the project is owned by australias crown resort who count chinese gamers as a major source of business 
its going to be even more of a competitive market said john decree an analyst at union gaming in las vegas everyones coming for the same customer its going to be a challenge with  rooms the hotel is small compared with many on the strip but with five restaurants it offers more dining options than many its size isaac brekken  for the times 
competition could also be fierce for chinese high rollers whose gambling activity has been curtailed by a slowing chinese economy and an anticorruption campaign at home that until recently sent macau gambling revenues into a twoyear slump 
las vegas isnt immune to those headwinds after years of explosive growth casinos on the strip experienced a decline in the amount of money bet on baccarat to about  billion in  thats nearly  billion less than  according to the nevada gaming control board 
the casino industry uses the card game as a proxy for chinese gambling activity because of its massive popularity within the culture thats both for practical and superstitious reasons baccarat has the best statistical odds of beating the house compared with other games and as a game of chance over skill baccarat also plays into chinese fatalistic attitudes toward luck 
the vast majority of baccarat play comes from the asian market said jacoby of lucky dragon 
jacobys casino will offer seven vip baccarat tables on a secondfloor terrace with access to a vast menu of authentic chinese food in addition to live seafood flown in from all over the world the property will serve staples like congee wonton noodles and dim sum 
food is expected to be a big draw because chinese vacationers overwhelmingly prefer their native cuisine over others 
las vegas has a number of wellregarded chinese restaurants such as ping pang pong at gold coast hotel  casino china mama in chinatown and an outpost of chengdu taste the san gabriel valley stalwart for sichuan cuisine highend chinese food is also served at highroller rooms such as the venetians paiza club 
no casino however boasts the concentration of chinese restaurants that lucky dragon will with five altogether the hope is chinese tourists staying at other properties will choose to eat  and gamble  at lucky dragon when they venture off the strip 
the emphasis on food means lucky dragons owners can eschew things that arent particularly important to chinese tourists like a whiskey bar or nightclub and because chinese tourists often dont like to sunbathe lucky dragons pool isnt much bigger than the backyard variety 
jacoby says his competitors on the strip offer chinese gamers a diluted experience by operating a handful of chinese restaurants and parlors in megacasinos that have to serve all manner of people not just chinese by comparison visitors to lucky dragon can start conversing in mandarin with staff as soon as they walk in he said 
were trying to take the asian gaming experience and bring that front and center instead of hiding the most valuable customer in a segregated portion of a large building jacoby said 
though lucky dragon will rely heavily on asian american customers at first its funding was largely drawn from mainland chinese investors through the federal eb visa program the visa allows foreigners and their immediate family to gain permanent us residency in exchange for a minimum investment of  that also creates american jobs rather than focusing on bars and nightclubs the casino is prioritizing dining options that includes a tea room still under construction isaac brekken  for the times 
chinese investors have dominated the program nationwide accounting for  of applicants awaiting eb visas though occasionally subject to fraud the program has successfully funded a handful of mixedused projects in new york the jw marriott hotel at la live and the sls hotel  casino across from lucky dragon 
jacoby declined to say how many chinese investors are involved in lucky dragon which is expected to employ  people jacoby also declined to disclose how much the project cost adding that earlier media reports pegging the price tag at about  million were inaccurate 
the company hit a snag last year when it unsuccessfully sought tax subsidies from the city but financial commitments from weidners family and others put the project back on track 
lucky dragon isnt the first las vegas resort to target a specific demographic the hard rock hotel  casino and the palms casino resort opened years ago catering to young partygoers and clubbers before eventually being overshadowed by larger competitors on the strip such as the mgm grand and the cosmopolitan 
lucky dragons early backers even considered building an lgbt resort before settling on their current strategy one they say will live and die on being able to deliver an authentic chinese gambling experience 
we set out trying to put together a place that would stand alone in shanghai if you dropped it off down there today jacoby said we didnt want to have just gongs asian tapestries and caricaturestuff like that",2016-11-08
386,why american surrogates are in demand for chinese families,"world wildlife falls by  in  years  
bbc news global wildlife populations have fallen by  since  a report says 
the living planet assessment by the zoological society of london zsl and wwf suggests that if the trend continues that decline could reach twothirds among vertebrates by  
the figures suggest that animals living in lakes rivers and wetlands are suffering the biggest losses 
human activity including habitat loss wildlife trade pollution and climate change contributed to the declines 
dr mike barrett head of science and policy at wwf said its pretty clear under business as usual we will see continued declines in these wildlife populations but i think now weve reached a point where there isnt really any excuse to let this carry on 
we know what the causes are and we know the scale of the impact that humans are having on nature and on wildlife populations  it really is now down to us to act 
however the methodology of the report has been criticised image copyright carlos drews  wwf image caption the report looked at data collected on  species of vertebrates over the last  years 
the living planet report is published every two years and aims to provide an assessment of the state of the worlds wildlife 
for freshwater species alone the decline stands at  since  dr mike barrett wwf 
this analysis looked at  different species of birds fish mammals amphibians and reptiles  about  of the total number of vertebrate species in the world 
the team collected data from peerreviewed studies government statistics and surveys collated by conservation groups and ngos 
any species with population data going back to  with two or more time points to show trends was included in the study 
the researchers then analysed how the population sizes had changed over time 
some of this information was weighted to take into account the groups of animals that had a great deal of data there are many records on arctic and near arctic birds for example or very little data tropical amphibians for example the report authors said this was to make sure a surplus of information about declines in some animals did not skew the overall picture 
the last report published in  estimated that the worlds wildlife populations had halved over the last  years 
this assessment suggests that the trend has continued since  populations have declined by an average of  
dr barrett said some groups of animals had fared worse than others 
we do see particularly strong declines in the freshwater environment  for freshwater species alone the decline stands at  since  this is related to the way water is used and taken out of fresh water systems and also the fragmentation of freshwater systems through dam building for example 
it also highlighted other species such as african elephants  which have suffered huge declines in recent years with the increase in poaching and sharks which are threatened by overfishing 
if pressures  overexploitation illegal wildlife trade for example  increase or worsen then that trend may be worse dr robin freeman zsl 
the researchers conclude that vertebrate populations are declining by an average of  each year and warn that if nothing is done wildlife populations could fall by  below  levels by the end of the decade 
dr robin freeman head of zsls indicators  assessments unit said but thats assuming things continue as we expect if pressures  overexploitation illegal wildlife trade for example  increase or worsen then that trend may be worse 
but one of the things i think is most important about these stats these trends are declines in the number of animals in wildlife populations  they are not extinctions by and large they are not vanishing and that presents us with an opportunity to do something about it image copyright scott dickerson image caption there are still many gaps in our knowledge of the worlds vertebrates 
however living planet reports have drawn some criticisms 
there are some numbers in the report that are sensible but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy stuart pimm duke university 
stuart pimm professor of conservation ecology at duke university in the united states said that while wildlife was in decline there were too many gaps in the data to boil population loss down to a single figure 
there are some numbers in the report that are sensible but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy he told bbc news 
for example if you look at where the data comes from not surprisingly it is massively skewed towards western europe 
when you go elsewhere not only do the data become far fewer but in practice they become much much sketchier there is almost nothing from south america from tropical africa there is not much from the tropics period any time you are trying to mix stuff like that it is is very very hard to know what the numbers mean 
theyre trying to pull this stuff in a blender and spew out a single number its flawed 
but dr freeman said the team had taken the best data possible from around the world 
its completely true that in some regions and in some groups like tropical amphibians for example we do have a lack of data but thats because there is a lack of data 
were confident that the method we are using is the best method to present an overall estimate of population decline 
its entirely possible that species that arent being monitored as effectively may be doing much worse  but id be very surprised if they were doing much better than we observed",2016-11-08

the future of tv might everyone taking hallucinogenic drugs according to the head of netflix 
the threats to the streaming tv company might not be amazon or other streaming services but instead pharmacological ways of entertaining people reed hastings has said 
and just as films and tv shows are a supposedly improved version of other entertainments those same things might eventually become defunct he said in the same way that the cinema and tv screen made the opera and the novel much smaller something else might be on the way to do the same thing the netflix boss said at a wall street journal event 
those challenges could come from anywhere he said they might not be another form of screen is it vr is it gaming is it pharmacological mr hastings asked the event 
he went on to say that it might be possible that in the coming years someone will develop a drug that will make people get the same experiences that at the moment come from streaming services like netflix apparently making reference to the matrix he said that we might be able to take one pill to escape into a hallucination and then another to come back 
in twenty or fifty years taking a personalized blue pill you just hallucinate in an entertaining way and then a white pill brings you back to normality is perfectly viable mr hastings said and if the source of human entertainment in thirty or forty years is pharmacological well be in real trouble 
his references to the matrix  and to being in trouble  recall arguments that have recently been made by tech billionaires including elon musk and sam altman both have suggested that it might be possible that we are part of a simulated universe  something that they said might be part of a virtual reality world but could just as easily be the result of a druginduced hallucination

all gov 
the controversy over genetically modified crops has long focused on largely unsubstantiated fears that they are unsafe to eat 
but an extensive examination by the new york times indicates that the debate has missed a more basic problem  genetic modification in the united states and canada has not accelerated increases in crop yields or led to an overall reduction in the use of chemical pesticides 
the promise of genetic modification was twofold by making crops immune to the effects of weedkillers and inherently resistant to many pests they would grow so robustly that they would become indispensable to feeding the worlds growing population while also requiring fewer applications of sprayed pesticides 
twenty years ago europe largely rejected genetic modification at the same time the united states and canada were embracing it comparing results on the two continents using independent data as well as academic and industry research shows how the technology has fallen short of the promise 
an analysis by the times using un data showed that the united states and canada have gained no discernible advantage in yields when measured against western europe a region with comparably modernized agricultural producers like france and germany  also a recent national academy of sciences report found there was little evidence that the introduction of genetically modified crops in the united states had led to yield gains beyond those seen in conventional crops 
at the same time herbicide use has increased in the united states even as major crops like corn soybeans and cotton have been converted to modified varieties and the united states has fallen behind europes biggest producer france in reducing the overall use of pesticides which includes both herbicides and insecticides 
one measure contained in data from the us geological survey  shows the stark difference in the use of pesticides since gm crops were introduced in the united states two decades ago for crops like corn cotton and soybeans the use of toxins that kill insects and fungi has fallen by a third but the spraying of herbicides which are used in much higher volumes has risen  percent 
by contrast in france use of insecticides and fungicides has fallen  percent and herbicide use has decreased  percent

on tuesday us defense secretary ashton carter announced that the armys tactical missile system atacms will be upgraded to strike both land and sea targets such technology will go a long way to defending allies against the chinese menace and battling moscows aggression in the baltics 
the missile system is sponsored by an office created by carter in  the strategic capabilities office which is currently being lead by will roper a protege of the secretarys during a panel at the center for strategic and international studies csis on friday roper told an audience how you offset the adversaries trying to offset your offset its very simple to do that you just dont talk about your best capabilitieswe are keeping our best ideas behind the door and probably always will according to breaking defense 
after the panel he continued we thought it was important to come out in public with atacms for the army because theres been a lot of writing a lot of speeches on the need for the army to go crossdomain high ranking officials in the us military have been calling for the atacms to extend its capabilities seaward for some time and roper responded to these concerns saying its time for us to show it isnt just a theoretical idea its something we can potentially get to quickly with something that we already have 
during a morning session at csis carter spoke of the new innovative features of the atacms and how the sco tries to maximize the potential of existing systems 
a prominent theme of scos work is spearheading creative and unexpected new ways to use our existing missiles and advanced munitions and across varied domains he said adding  by integrating an existing seeker onto the front of the missile theyre enabling it to hit moving targets both at sea as well as on land with this capability what was previously an army surfacetosurface missile system can project power from coastal locations up to  kilometers into the maritime domain 
carter detailed the scos plans to utilize seeker technology that the defense department has already developed so the missile system can hit targets both on sea and land

russia today president vladimir putin has signed an act suspending a  agreement between the us and russia on reprocessing weaponsgrade plutonium extracted from decommissioned warheads 
the bill has already been published on russias official legal information website meaning its now in force 
it mentions that a decision to restore the agreement can only be made by russias president 
the deal between moscow and washington was ratified in  as a means to safely utilize weaponsgrade plutonium it suggested a specific procedure to turn it into nuclear plant fuel starting from  it was planned to reprocess  tons  pounds of plutonium which would have been enough to produce thousands of nuclear weapons ria novosti reported 
yet while russia has prepared the infrastructure necessary for the process the us said it found the procedure too costly and instead opted for mixing plutonium with special dilutants to store it indefinitely 
russia suspended the deal  due to drastic changes of circumstances the rise of threat to strategic stability as a result of hostile actions of the us towards the russian federation and the inability of the us to provide for the accepted obligations to utilize the excess weaponsgrade plutonium in accordance with the agreement  the new bill read 
for the agreement to be resumed washington should reduce the us military presence on the territory of nato members that joined the bloc after  cancel its magnitsky act which bans entry to the us to a list of russian citizens as well as lift other antirussian sanctions and compensate the loss moscow suffered as a result of such policy

russia today almost half of all respondents in a recent russian opinion poll said they feared that the aggravation of relations between russia and the west caused by the ongoing crisis in syria could develop into a global military conflict 
the share of those who see the probability of world war three in the near future as high or very high is now at  percent and those who appraise it as low or very low comprise  percent of society the privatelyowned public opinion research center levada reported on monday the remaining  percent of respondents said they couldnt give a simple answer to the question 
when researchers asked citizens if they considered it possible that russia and the west would eventually find a mutually acceptable solution to the crisis  percent answered that this scenario was likely or very likely thirtynine percent evaluate the probability of such an outcome as low or very low and  percent said that they couldnt answer the question 
just over half   percent  of russians said they approve of their countrys involvement in the syrian conflict and  percent said they had a negative or sharply negative attitude to this just under a quarter   percent  couldnt answer the question about their personal view on the subject those who thought that russia should continue the operation and those who thought that airstrikes should be stopped were divided  percent against  percent respectively with  percent finding the question too difficult to answer 
the level of awareness about the situation in syria and the russian air force operation against islamic state is formerly isisisil terrorists there remained fairly high eighteen percent said they were very closely following developments in syria and  percent revealed partial familiarity with the issue just under a fifth   percent  said that they were not interested in news about syria 
a similar poll conducted a year ago by the independent levada center showed that over  percent of russian citizens supported the air operations against is terrorists in syria and almost a half of them agreed that it was right for russia to support the government of syrias democraticallyelected president bashar assad

398,russiaus plutonium deal no longer in effect,"fbi releases clinton foundation investigation records  
daily caller 
the fbi on tuesday released documents related to a nowclosed federal investigation of an alleged paytoplay scheme involving bill clinton and the clinton foundation 
the documents which are heavily redacted regard the investigation of clintons lastminute pardon of marc rich a billionaire fugitive who was wanted in the us for tax evasion 
the jan   pardon sparked the last controversy to befall the scandalplagued clinton administration richs exwife denise donated more than  million to various clinton and democratic entities including the democratic national committee hillary clintons new york senate campaign and the clinton foundation 
the release provides little in the way of information that has not already been publicized but the dump is noteworthy for two reasons it reminds voters that the clinton white house and clinton foundation were embroiled in an investigation concerning paytoplay allegations the clinton foundation is reportedly being investigated at the present by multiple fbi field offices 
it also comes as the fbi is locked in a bitter standoff with the clinton foundation and the justice department over fbi director james comeys handling of the hillary clinton email investigation 
the newlyreleased files include one entry which shows that the required pardon standards and procedures were not followed prior to the rich pardon 
roger adams the us pardon attorney at the time testified to congress in feb  that none of the regular procedures were followed ahead of the rich reprieve 
former attorney general eric holder is also mentioned in the file it cites holders testimony that he was the only person who worked at doj  he was deputy attorney general at the time  about the rich pardon from the fbis clinton foundation investigation files 
a grand jury was convened to weigh the merits of the case but no indictments were handed down ironically the law enforcement official who closed the case was fbi director comey he served as deputy attorney general in the george w bush administration 
the fbis website suggests that more clinton foundation investigation records could be coming in the future 
this initial release consists of material from the fbis files related to the william j clinton foundation  a nonprofit c organization the site reads the bulk of these records come from a  fbi investigation into the pardon of marc rich  aka marcell david reich by president clinton in  it was closed in  
the fbi did not respond to a request for more information on future releases 
update clinton campaign press secretary brian fallon questioned the release 
the fbi issued a statement late tuesday afternoon saying that the file was released in response to a foia request 
the fbis records management division receives thousands of foia requests annually which are processed on a first in first out fifo basis the statement reads 
by law foia materials that have been requested three or more times are posted electronically to the fbis public reading room shortly after they are processed per the standard procedure for foia these materials became available for release and were posted automatically and electronically to the fbis public reading room in accordance with the law and established procedures",2016-11-02

editors comment he who holds the gold makes the rules fresh attempts at containing russia and continuing the empire have been met with countermoves russia appears to be building strength in every way putin and his country have no intention of being under the american thumb and are developing rapid resistance as the us petrodollar loses its grip and china russia and the east shift into new currencies and shifting world order 
what lies ahead it will be a strong hand for the countries that have the most significant backing in gold and hard assets and china and russia have positioned themselves very well prepare for a changing economic landscape and one in which selfreliance might be all we have 
russia is hoarding gold at an alarming rate  the next world war will be fought with currencies 
by jay syrmopoulos 
with all eyes on russias unveiling their latest nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile icbm which nato has dubbed the satan missile  as tensions with the us increase moscows most potent weapon may be something drastically different 
the rapidly evolving geopolitical weapon brandished by russia is an ever increasing stockpile of gold as well as russias native currency the ruble 
take a look at the symbol below as it could soon come to change the entire hierarchy of the international order  potentially ushering in a complete international paradigm shift  and much sooner than you might think 
image httpthefreethoughtprojectcomwpcontentuploadsbankofrussiaepng 
the symbol is the new designation of the russian ruble russias national currency 
similar to how the us uses the dollar sign  the uk uses the pound sign  and the european union uses the euro symbol  russia is about to begin exporting its symbol internationally 
after the failed reset in usrussian relations by the obama administration and the continued deterioration of the countries relationship washington began targeting entire sectors of the russian economy as well as specific individuals meant to impose an economic burden so severe that it would force moscow into compliance 
instead of decimating russia what it precipitated was a russian response of gradually weaning themselves off of the hegemony of the us petrodollar and working with china to create an alternative to the swift payment system that isnt solely controlled by western interests see asian infrastructure investment bank  new development bank 
according to the corbett report  
new reports indicate that china is ready to launch its swift alternative and for those who have their ear to the ground this is the most significant move yet in the unfolding process of dedollarization that is seeing the bricsled resistance bloc breaking away from the financial stranglehold of the usled washington consensus 
for those who dont know swift stands for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication and is shorthand for the swiftnet network that is used by over  financial institutions in  countries and territories to transmit financial transaction data around the world swift does not do any of the clearing or processing for these transactions itself but instead sends the payment orders that are then settled by correspondent banks of the member institutions still given the systems near universality in the financial system it means that virtually every international transaction between banking institutions goes through the swift network 
this is why delisting from the swift network remains one of the primary financial weapons wielded by the us and its allies in their increasingly important financial warfare campaigns 
recently financial guru jim rickards author of the book currency wars wrote that russia is poised for a major comeback in its economy russian bonds and stocks and the russian currency the ruble will all benefit rickards believes a strong turnaround is coming within russia and that this comeback will benefit the ruble 
while still suffering from the economic warfare being waged by the us russia has realized that as long they are subservient to the petrodollar there remains a clear and present danger of the russian economy being devastated by the whims of washington 
the bank of russia that nations central bank is extremely clear about its mission and monetary policy declaring on its website 
monetary policy constitutes an integral part of the state policy and is aimed at enhancing wellbeing of russian citizens the bank of russia implements monetary policy in the framework of inflationtargeting regime and sees price stability albeit sustainably low inflation as its priority given structural peculiarities of the russian economy the target is to reduce inflation to  by  and maintain it within that range in the medium run 
in laymans terms that means that monetary policy similar to nuclear weapons and the military are an integral part of the state policy in russia while many analysts have noted the increased buildup in russias military arsenal seemingly few have highlighted the massive buildup of russian gold reserves over the past decade 
below is a chart showing russian gold reserves between  and last year  
since  there has been a yearonyear increase that reveals a significant upward trend the chart clearly reveals that russias state policy of increasing state monetary assets in the form of gold additionally the russian government has been converting state rubles into gold assets from  to  russias state holdings of gold tripled 
within just the past year russia has substantially increased its gold holdings 
according to the business insider  
in july of this year the central bank of russia added  ounces of gold to its reserves the onemonth uptick in russian gold reserves   ounces  is approximately equal to the entire annual output of barrick golds turquoise ridge gold mine in nevada 
at that same rate   ounces per month  in a mere five months russia would add to state gold reserves the equivalent of the entire annual output of barricks massive goldstrike mine in nevada 
currently russian gold reserves rank seventh in the world its clear that there is a concerted effort by russian authorities to build up the countrys gold reserves as part of a national strategy to negate the effects of economic warfare waged by the united states 
rickards in his  book currency wars theorized that russia and china could combine their gold reserves to form a global goldbacked currency to compete against the us dollar currently russian reserves stand at roughly  tonnes with chinese reserves totaling over  tonnes according to china  its likely more which would amount to a combined total of roughly  tonnes of gold 
the us is about to lose overarching control of policymaking within the international monetary fund imf thus the us lockup on global gold is about to vanish according to business insider 
imagine for a moment the distinctly real possibility that russianchinese alliance could exercise indirect or even direct control over the imfs gold reserve of over  tonnes russian chinese and imf gold combined would equal roughly  tonnes and would allow for direct competition with the us gold reserves estimated at  tonnes 
russia and china have realized that the petrodollar is wielded by washington as its weapon of choice when opposing a wellarmed state and clearly see the writing on the wall  thus working together to create a new global financial paradigm 
the reality is that the united states is  trillion dollars in debt and eventually the time will come when the us economy begins to implode  and all the fiat currency people are stuck holding will essentially be worth nothing more than the paper its printed on hard assets such as gold and silver should be bought and taken custody of while there is still an opportunity to do so as a means of hedging against the potentially disastrous results of the us using the petrodollar as a weapon 
ultimately the united states russia and china are all controlled by centralized powerhungry tyrants attempting to command powerful global bureaucracies like the imf the world bank swift new development bank and the asian infrastructure investment bank 
its not russian nuclear weapons that people should fear as the policy of mutually assured destruction essentially voids any benefit of a state launching a firststrike nuclear attack the true threat to america is our economic house of cards built upon the back of a neoliberal trade policy that puts the rights of corporations over that of people

400,fbi releases clinton foundation investigation records,"china airport security robot gives electroshocks  
activist post 
while debate surrounds the threat of autonomous killer robots the mechanized replacement of humans continues across the workforce 
the industrial robotics industry is logging record sales worldwide and there appears to be no sign of a slowdown as you can see in the graphic below  sales surged  over a previous record year to reach almost  million units 
there are many factors driving this growth which you can read about here but one point worth noting is that the two leading countries are the us and china with china leading the way 
the nature of robotics is also changing as new developments in artificial intelligence are giving robots an increasing range of potential uses one key area of course is security robot security guards have already begun appearing at prisons  care facilities  and schools in various locations around the world 
one us robot company gamma  robotics has designed several models for mass production their latest  ramsee  can be seen in the video below a true mass rollout of this fully autonomous security guard could significantly impact the  million humans that are currently employed in some form of security patrol 
ramsee advertises the following capabilities is a physical presence that autonomously patrols without supervision provides realtime data intruders motion heat fire smoke gases  more is a humanmachine interface that creates a powerful force multiplier 
significantly gamma  robotics has partnered with hexagon safety  infrastructure the global leader in public safety and security solutions 
however ramsee is missing one thing weapons for that we have to travel to china where they seem to have embraced police robots full throttle 
in late  i covered an announcement from chinas xinhua news agency where they announced the development and deployment of  weaponized antiterrorism robots that would be far more active than a mere patrol 
the toysized robots can coordinate with each other on the battlefield said the report following their unveiling at the  world robot conference in beijing 
the first model is known as a reconnaissance robot which scouts for poisonous gases dangerous chemicals and explosives before transmitting its findings back to baseif this initial investigation detects a simple bomb is the source of danger the second robot model  a small explosive ordnance disposal eod machine  would be sent in to diffuse it 
but with other more complicated threats an attacker robot would start its mission armed with minorcaliber weapons recoilless rifles and grenade launchers 
with a sighting telescope a trigger and a safe installed the attacker can hit its target from a long distance xinhua said 
the local police force in beijing was reported to be among the buyers for the three robots  which are priced at  million yuan  for the set by manufacturers hit robot group who are based in the northern city of harbin 
apart from antiterror operations they can also be applied in fire fighting public security forestry and agriculture the companys sales manager chen deqiang said according to xinhua 
if we have learned anything about antiterrorism efforts authorities consider frontline deployment to be areas of public travel we were given the tsa based on such notions and have since witnessed its intrusive role in airports and soontobe at other public transportation if authorities have their way 
china has gone to the next level with a robot tsa of sorts called anbot that is equipped with what is essentially a taserlike device that is being fittingly compared to a cattleprod 
image credit 
it was first introduced at a tech show earlier in the year and was speculated to have been designed for protest suppression for now its first job is to patrol chinas shenzhen airport 
most alarming however is that it is tied to one of the most powerful supercomputers on the planet 
the back end of this intelligent security robot is l inked to chinas tianhe supercomputer  where it has access to cloud services  anbot conducts patrols recognizes threats and has multiple cameras that use facial recognition 
these cloud services give the robots petascale processing power  well beyond onboard processing capabilities in the robot the supercomputer connection is there to enhance the intelligent learning capabilities and humanmachine interface of these devices said the uschina economic and security review in a report released tuesday that examines chinas autonomous systems development efforts  emphasis added 
 source  
this link to cloud services is a new trend in robot artificial intelligence that also has been referred to as the wikipedia for robots  essentially an internet cloud brain through robottorobot information sharing they can speed up their learning process  autonomously examples have included robots that can learn to cook and robots that can learn the tasks involved in caregiving however when applied to policing things become much more ethically troubling 
people were outraged in the us for example when a robot in dallas was used to deliver a pound of c explosive to a us citizen whom the police deemed a sufficient threat worthy of immediate execution at least in that case a human made the decision but it is being viewed as a tiptoe along the path to the widespread use of killer robots much as we have seen with the use of drones discussion was once limited to overseas  egregious enough  but there has been a growing voice of those who are urging weaponized domestic police drones 
as john vibes wrote  it might be inevitable 
the taser corporation is planning on building a drone that is equipped with a stun gun according to a recent report by the wall street journal 
not only will the drones be equipped with tasers but there is also talk of them being autonomous meaning that an actual human wont necessarily be needed to fly the drone 
this is actually already being done in india  the first country to have approved the use of drones attached with nonlethal weapons and just this week british tabloid the sun  had a feature entitled vladimir putins russia is preparing an army of robots and drones to take on its enemies deputy pm dmitry rogozin admits given the available facts this title no longer seems so deliberately sensational 
clearly we are entering a potentially dangerous convergence of expanding robotic artificial intelligence along with the political will to continue allowing robots more and more autonomy as they carry out the traditional duties of the military and police some experts argue that the precision of robotics will curb many of the abuses we have seen from our military and police but is that the trend we are actually seeing or will automated systems of violent control inevitably lead to even greater industriallevel suppression and killing

wikileaks posted more than half a million us state department diplomatic documents from  detailing americas interactions with countries all around the world  including grenada prime minister eric gairys efforts to organize a united nationsbased committee to research and investigate global ufo reports 
many of the documents written by american un officials indicated how closely they were monitoring grenadas uforelated activities 
one document  from nov   revealed my involvement in helping grenada to produce a credible ufo presentation 
i had an opportunity in early  to meet gairy in new york to present an idea about how i thought the un would pay attention to his ufo crusade through his ambassadors i gave him a copy of a documentary record album ufos the credibility factor that i produced for cbs inc in  
gairy and i met and after i convinced him i could bring a very credible group of speakers to the un he agreed to sponsor my proposal see image below shortly after a handshake deal he made me a temporary delegateadviser of grenada and the rest was well history courtesy of lee speigel this  letter from grenada to lee speigel confirmed that countrys commitment to sponsor speigels ufo presentation at the united nations 
the following image shows part of the group i brought together in july  to meet with un secretarygeneral kurt waldheim he wanted to know what we were planning to do at our november event in front of the special political committee which included representatives from the committee on the peaceful uses of outer space courtesy of lee speigel on july   producer lee speigel now a huffington post writer brought together a group of military scientific and psychological experts to meet with united nations secretarygeneral kurt waldheim to discuss speigels upcoming presentation to the un special political committee later that year topic the importance of establishing an international ufo committee pictured from left usaf astronaut col gordon cooper astronomer jacques vallee astronomerastrophysicist claude poher astronomer j allen hynek grenada prime minister sir eric gairy waldheim morton gleisner of the special political committee lee speigel researcher leonard stringfield and university of colorado psychologist david saunders 
another cable posted on wikileaks  from nov   refers to ambassador richard petrees meeting with grenada representatives to discuss their ufo resolution ambassador petree acknowledged the high level of interest in ufos among some elements of the private sector and scientific community  and pointed to the budgetary impact as a major concern of the us and other countries 
on nov   the day after our presentation at the un this document was sent through official channels detailing the actual ufo event describing what each of the invited scientific and military speakers had to say to the member nations 
a few days after that on dec   a followup cable was transmitted including the following 
subsequent to the introduction of the grenadian ufo resolution misoff mission officer has engaged in two separate informal negotiating sessions which included representation from austria ussr and grenada in an attempt to arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise solution to the problem 
a draft decision to be taken by the special political committee spc has been agreed upon by the participants in the informal negotiations subject to concurrence of their respective capitals we think referral of the ufo matter to the outer space committee osc without a preordained mandate as to what action is to be taken provides the flexibility the osc needs to take whatever action it deems appropriate 
it will also obviate the need to vote on a resolution and gamble on the results 
the following week brought forth another document  on dec   which stated 
the general assembly invites interested member states to take appropriate steps to coordinate on a national level scientific research and investigation into extraterrestrial life including unidentified flying objects and to inform the secretarygeneral of the observations research and evaluation of such activities 
it was further suggested that grenadas views on ufos could be discussed in  unfortunately that didnt come to pass as grenada prime minister gairy was overthrown in a  coup 
needless to say without the gairybased initiative on ufos it was quietly relegated to grenadas back burner 
this is the tip of the ufoun iceberg it shows how the subject of ufos wasnt merely officially ridiculed or slapped aside there was and perhaps still is some interest there just waiting to emerge",2016-11-02

usa today 
authorities captured a yearold male suspect without incident wednesday hours after an earlymorning ambushstyle killing of two police officers in the des moines metro area 
the suspect in the backtoback killings was identified as scott michael greene said urbandale police spokesman sgt chad underwood before capturing him police had described greene who was last seen driving a blue ford f with an iowa license plate as armed and dangerous 
greene was taken into custody by the dallas county sheriffs department while walking along a rural road in redfield about  miles west of where the shootings occurred 
according to police greene flagged down a passing department of natural resources officer handed over his id and told the officer to call police no shots were fired and there was no struggle according to police 
the suspect was taken by ambulance to a des moines hospital with an unknown injury 
in a late morning news conference police identified the slain officers as urbandale police officer justin martin and des moines police sgt anthony tony beminio 
the attacks began around  am ct when police departments from both cities responded to reports of gunfire at the intersection of th street and aurora avenue in urbandale 
the first officers arriving on the scene found martin fatally wounded about  minutes later some two miles away beminio was was shot near the intersection of merle hay road and sheridan ave while responding to reports of the first officers shooting beminio was transported to iowa methodist medical center where he died scott michael greene photo des moines police 
both officers were gunned down in their patrol cars 
it doesnt look like there was any interaction between these officers and whoever the coward is that shot them while they sat in their cars a visibly emotional parizek told reporters 
in all appearances it looks  that these officers were ambushed he added officer from des moines and another from urbandale were shot and killed in their cars dmpolice said officersdown 
 daniel p finney newsmanone november   
des moines police fearing officers were being singled out paired up its patrol officers so none were on the street alone parizek said 
theres literally a clear and present danger if youre a police officer he said 
police did not offer many details on how investigators identified greene as a suspect underwood said he was identified through a series of leads and a series of investigative tips 
as of an earlymorning news conference police were still notifying the family members of the slain officers and planned to withhold the officers names years of service and other details until later in the day parizek said 
attorney general loretta lynch condemned the killings saying violence has no place in the united states of america 
let me be clear there is no message in murder the attorney general said referring to simmering distrust between law enforcement and many communities across the country violence creates nothing it only destroys a des moines police officer was found fatally shot in a vehicle near the intersection of merle hay road and sheridan avenue in des moines on wednesday nov   photo brian powers the des moines register 
its the first time des moines has seen a police officer shot and killed in the line of duty since two officers were gunned down in separate incidents in  
two des moines officers susan farrell and carlos puentemorales died earlier this year when their vehicle was struck headon by a wrongway drunk driver 
the killing of the urbandale officer appeared to be the citys first for an officer shot in the line of duty underwood said at the news conference 
parizek thanked the community for its support when the department lost farrell and puentemorales as well as with this tragedy 
i dont even know where to begin on how bad this year is he said but this is what we do we come in day in and day out we go out there and provide the same level of service regardless of whats going on in our personal and professional lives officers investigate the scene at merle hay and sheridan ave where an officer was found shot at about  am on on wednesday nov   in urbandale 
in a statement iowa gov terry branstad called the attack on the officers an attack on the public safety of all iowans 
we call on iowans to support our law enforcement officials in bringing this suspect to justice he said our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the police officers who were tragically killed in the line of duty as well as the officers who continue to put themselves in harms way 
iowa sen joni ernst extended her thoughts and prayers to the families of the officers killed 
although the investigation is still unfolding what appears to be an ambush attack of police in the line of duty is an attack on the community at large and all of the men and women who risk their lives every day to protect us ernst said this was a senseless act of violence and it cannot be tolerated

while speaking to supporters in cincinnati on monday democrat hillary clinton hinted at a second civil war if gop nominee donald trump wins breitbartcom reported 
charlie spiering wrote 
he has a dark and divisive vision for america that could tear our country apart clinton said to supporters in cincinnati ohio on halloween 
clinton specifically referred to the civil war suggesting that the country faced a similar threat of divisiveness from donald trump 
abraham lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand and that was over the greatest of challenges  the challenge posed by slavery  and we fought a civil war she said 
she warned voters that it was time for the country to take the divisions in the country seriously 
but we also have to take stock of how divided we are today the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together she added failing to admit that her side is the one that has divided america by race class and gender 
she also claimed that trump would start a nuclear war if a foreign leader got under his skin 
i know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fearmongering but i dont think so she said at a rally in kent ohio earlier in the day 
a post at barracuda brigade observed 
liberals especially the clinton are always projecting anything that they accuse the other side of is what they are doing she suggests that her message is one of hope and change when in fact it is just more of the same 
moreover trump has spent a great deal of time talking about policies and issues while clinton  co have done absolutely nothing but engage in fearmongering and fingerpointing 
still we have to ask  was clintons hint a warning or a threat

reuters 
down a georgia country road camouflaged members of the three percent security force have mobilized for rifle practice handtohand combat training  and an impromptu campaign rally for republican presidential candidate donald trump 
how many people are voting for trump oohrah asks chris hill a paralegal who goes by the code name bloodagent 
oohrah shout a dozen militia members in response as morning sunlight sifted through the trees last weekend 
as the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on nov  and civil unrest in the days following a victory by democrat hillary clinton 
they say they wont fire the first shot but theyre not planning to leave their guns at home either 
trumps populist campaign has energized militia members like hill who admire the republican moguls promise to deport illegal immigrants stop muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the mexico border trump has repeatedly warned that the election may be rigged and has said he may not respect the results if he does not win at least one paramilitary group the oath keepers has called on members to monitor voting sites for signs of fraud 
armed paramilitary groups first gained prominence in the early s fueled by confrontations in ruby ridge idaho and waco texas culminating in a militia sympathizers  bombing of a federal office building in oklahoma city that killed  people 
their numbers dwindled following that attack but have spiked in recent years driven by fears that president barack obama will threaten gun ownership and erode the power of local government the southern poverty law center which tracks extremist groups estimates there were  active militias last year up from  in  
in recent years armed groups have confronted federal authorities in a series of landuse disputes in the western united states federal officials fear more clashes could come after seven militants were acquitted on conspiracy charges for occupying a federal wildlife refuge in oregon 
many fear clinton would push the county further to the left 
this is the last chance to save america from ruin hill said im surprised i was able to survive or suffer through eight years of obama without literally going insane but hillary is going to be more of the same 

extremist groups emboldened 
the oath keepers a prominent antigovernment force that sent guntoting members to the  race riots in ferguson missouri called on members last week to monitor voting sites on election day for any signs of fraud 
an hour south of atlanta the three percent security force started the day around the campfire taking turns shooting automatic pistols and rifles at a makeshift target range they whooped with approval when blasts from one members highpowered rifle knocked down a tree 
the group operates independently but is affiliated with a national armed movement that calls for members to defend individual rights in the face of what they see as an overreaching federal government the movement draws its name from the notion that no more than  percent of the american population fought in the revolutionary war against britain 
amid the war games hill weighed plans for a possible armed march on washington if clinton wins 
he said he doesnt want his members leading the way but they will defend the protesters if need be his group will not hesitate to act if a president clinton tries to disarm gun owners he said 
i will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen and prevent them from being disarmed and i will fight and i will kill and i may die in the process said hill who founded the militia several years ago 
trumps candidacy has emboldened extremist groups to speak more openly about challenging the rule of law said ryan lenz a researcher at the southern poverty law center 
prior to this campaign season these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the american political landscape he said now these ideas are legitimized 
over the past week some prominent trump supporters have hinted at violence 
if trump loses im grabbing my musket former illinois representative joe walsh wrote on twitter last week conservative commentator wayne root fantasized about clintons death while speaking at a trump rally in las vegas on sunday 
back in georgia the three percent security force wrapped up rifle practice in the midday sun they then headed further into the trees to tackle an obstacle course with loaded pistols at their sides ready for whatever may come

press tv us democratic presidential candidate hillary clintons unpopularity among american voters has reached a new high according to recent polls putting her on par with her republican rival donald trump 
according to the final preelection new york timescbs news poll released on thursday an overwhelming majority of american voters are disgusted by the state of us politics and most view trump and clinton as dishonest 
more than  percent of voters say the presidential campaign has left them repulsed rather than excited the poll found 
having the two most hated politicians running for president of the us representing the two largest political parties has made a mockery of our democracy and electoral process hoenig told press tv on friday 
hillary clinton lied and stole her way to the nomination for the democrats and trump bullied his way by insulting every interest group in america including his fellow republican opponents he added 
for the third parties we have gary johnson of the libertarian party who has been made a laughing stock for his ignorance of foreign policy his poll numbers are dropping the other rd party candidate is jill stein of the green party who is seeing an actual rise in her numbers in spite of lies and smears coming from mostly the democrats with assistance from the main stream media he said 
that the race is tightening is no surprise it often happens at this time but the reasons now are not because people are becoming more assured of who they want but more and more disgusted in the choices they have he stated 
regardless of who wins and its most probable that itll be either clinton or trump this countrys nightmare will only begin on jan st the day after the inauguration if its clinton one wouldnt be surprised if the ink on the articles of impeachment isnt already dried by then its possible that criminal charges will have been presented to her or that she had received by then a presidential pardon from the outgoing president obama the analyst noted 
president ford once said when he was a leader in the house of representatives that impeachment is for whatever the congress wants it to be simply the whiff of impropriety or criminal behavior would make any partisan congressman see that as reason enough for such an article of impeachment compound that with an actual indictment and its guaranteed he said

dna india 
the worlds largest and most sensitive cosmic ray monitor located in india has recorded a burst of galactic cosmic rays that indicates a crack in the earths magnetic shield according to scientists 
the burst occurred when a giant cloud of plasma ejected from the solar corona struck earth at a very high speed causing massive compression of the earths magnetosphere and triggering a severe geomagnetic storm 
the grapes muon telescope located at tata institute of fundamental researchs cosmic ray laboratory in ooty in tamil nadu recorded a burst of galactic cosmic rays of about  gev last year lasting for two hours 
the burst occurred when a giant cloud of plasma ejected from the solar corona and moving with a speed of about  million kilometres per hour struck our planet causing a severe compression of earths magnetosphere from  to  times the radius of earth 
it triggered a severe geomagnetic storm that generated aurora borealis and radio signal blackouts in many high latitude countries according to the study published in the journal physical review letters this week 
earths magnetosphere extends over a radius of a million kilometres which acts as the first line of defence shielding us from the continuous flow of solar and galactic cosmic rays thus protecting life on our planet from these high intensity energetic radiations 
numerical simulations performed by the grapes researchers including pravata k mohanty indicate that the earths magnetic shield temporarily cracked due to the occurrence of magnetic reconnection allowing the lower energy galactic cosmic ray particles to enter our atmosphere 
earths magnetic field bent these particles about  degree from the dayside to the nightside of the earth where it was detected as a burst by the grapes muon telescope around midnight on  june  
the data was analysed and interpreted through extensive simulation over several weeks by using the core computing farm that was built inhouse by the grapes team of physicists and engineers at the cosmic ray laboratory in ooty

usa today 
the man who caused a commotion at a donald trump rally saturday said hes a registered republican who wanted only to show his displeasure with his partys nominee 
members of the audience at the event for the gop presidential nominee tackled austyn crites  of reno after someone yelled gun while others were trying to rip away his antitrump sign 
i just went with sign that said republicans against trump  crites said its a sign that you can find online i held up the sign and initially people around me were just booing me telling me to get out of there then a couple of these guys tried grabbing the sign out of my hands 
crites had no weapon secret service agents later released a statement to that effect and let him go without charges 
agents whisked trump offstage because crites was near the front of the auditorium at the renosparks convention center 
crites said he holds no ill will toward the secret service or reno police who were just doing their job 
i was trying to get the secret services attention for them to respond said michael newton  of santa rosa calif who helped restrain crites they didnt respond i thought i had to do something i put my knee on what i think was his head so im not really sure there were five guys on him and he was moving i tried to help them immobilize him in final colorado push trump urges supporters to handdeliver ballots 
newton said he felt as if crites were the aggressor 
i saw his hand contact someones face he said maybe two people 
crites said he didnt strike anyone but after he was taken to the ground he felt as if he were being mobbed 
multiple people just tackled me down kicking me choking me and just beating me up he said thats when things even got crazier i was on the ground and people were holding my arms legs and i kept saying i can barely breathe i was turning my neck just to get a little bit of air to keep from passing out 
thats when police intervened taking crites away in handcuffs 
newtons partner donald newton  of santa rosa took video of the immediate aftermath 
the secret service said its investigation is ongoing the agency uses magnetometers at presidential campaign sites making it difficult for weapons to be smuggled into events 
whats baffling to crites is how anyone could have thought he had a gun his sign was in the air for some time and he wasnt making any sudden movements he said 
it wasnt like they noticed something suspicious and tackled me crites said thats not the case 
he said he backs some gop candidates and just wanted to voice frustration with trump not cause panic 
i love all the people in that rally he said were all fellow americans theyre doing their patriotic duty they support their candidate im just there showing that im a republican im all of your peoples brother i just have a slight difference of opinion 
later on facebook crites wrote that he has no connection with the campaign of democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton but has canvassed for her for about three hours contributed to her campaign and voted for her 
take what happened to me tonight as a classic example of dictator incitement of violence  against your own republican brother with a stupid sign he wrote the post and his entire account were taken down soon afterward as some trump supporters on social media called him a clinton thughillary shill and trump assassin 
shortly after the incident at the rally trump returned to the stage to raucous applause thanking the secret service and launching back into his prepared remarks his campaign later issued a statement also thanking the secret service and his supporters

415,bill clinton and hillary lolita express pedophilia ring,"opinion hillary is the whore of babylon and is not human  
tracy twyman 
i put some of this information in an article i published yesterday morning about a larger subject today i have decided to isolate these segments and add more for a comprehensive piece on the subject because other relevant information has emerged 
people in the fbi think hillary clinton is the antichrist  they are close she is the whore of babylon 
hillary was born in  supposedly i looked for this information on a hunch after noticing several clues and sure enough back in  someone on david ickes forum speculated that hillary may have been the moonchild that according to artist marjorie cameron  was implanted into her own womb by rocket scientist occultist and crowley associate jack parsons during a ritual called the  babalon working  the purpose was to birth a child to be an incarnation of what crowley called  babalon  the scarlet whore with the cup of blood foretold in st johns revelation that rides the beast 
cameron actually claimed that this fetus after being taken from her womb was delivered to people involved in the militarys nuclear weapons progranm who were apparently in cahoots with parsons and placed inside of a nuclear bomb that was tested but the fetus survived she said because it had been placed inside of a special canister made exactly for this purpose for the  trinity bomb test they made a special canister called jumbo that was supposed to to preserve the plutonium if the bomb did failed to go off they reportedly didnt end up using it for that but it has been suggested that this is what preserved the fetus of the moonchild presumably it grew up to be somebody 
crowley named one of his female consorts who he always called his scarlet women hilarion her name was jeanne foster crowleys attempt to conceive an heir as a magical child with hilarion resulted supposedly in the childs spirit being attached to his protege charles stanfield jones back in  the attachment allegedly occurred when jones went through the ritual for crossing the abyss in the th degree of the oto which involves being ritually sodomized by everyone in the group 
jack parsons another person who had willingly subjected himself to this ritual channeled the book of the antichrist in  where he foretold 
and within seven years of this time babalon the scarlet woman hilarion will manifest among ye and bring this my work to its fruition

in rome the hilaria was a festival to the goddess cybele worshipped in the form of a black meteorite stone to celebrate the resurrection of her son who as the legend states she had been having sex with she then became jealous of his love of others castrated him and let him die of bleeding the reason why all of her priests the galli were castrated and actually considered women she later regretted this and caused him to be brought back to life then forced everyone under her rule to celebrate by laughing and partying joyously as commemorated in this festival consider this next time you notice hillary clinton laughing inappropriately 
also note that hillary clinton has made several selfdepricating jokes about herself being  not even human  and shortcircuiting when she gets herself twisted up in her own lies specifically in october  when her interviewer at buzzfeed noted that she seemed to not be sweating even though it was a hot day odd because hillary has notoriously bad bo she asked hillary what kind of deodorant she used clintons reply was astounding

416,the man behind the trump rally disturbance in reno,"us military hackers claim penetration of russia  
sputnik news 
us military hackers have penetrated russias electric grid telecommunications networks and kremlins command systems making them vulnerable to attack by secret american cyber weapons according to a series of reports by a major us television network 
nbc news disclosed the penetration in a series of reports explaining that us efforts parallel claims also by us officials that russia china and other nations have placed hidden malware on parts of us critical infrastructure 
the penetration by all sides appears to be in preparation for an allout war in cyberspace according to nbc news which said it was briefed by a us intelligence official and given an opportunity to review highly classified documents 
at the same time the network downplayed the prospect of a cyber war making it appear as if the leak was intended as a warning to us adversaries 
nbc news then attempted to link its explosive report to tuesdays us presidential election citing concerns of mischief by russian hackers that would fall far short of the armageddonlike scenario that the report implied 
instead the network explained us electionrelated concerns as cyber mischief which could involve releasing fake documents or creating bogus social media accounts to spread misinformation 
the obama administration has created a public but unconfirmed narrative that hackers controlled by the russian government have stolen emails from the democratic party headquarters a private computer used by presidential candidate hillary clinton while serving as secretary of state and computers used by clinton campaign chairman john podesta 
according to the narrative russia stole the emails and gave the messages to wikileaks which has flooded the internet with the material on a daily basis leading up to tuesdays election 
russia has denied any responsibility for the clintonrelated hacks and links between wikileaks and russian intelligence have never been substantiated 
moreover recent media reports in the united states indicate that clintons private server she used for official business during her tenure as secretary of state had been penetrated by at least five foreign intelligence services 
the emails have proved especially embarrassing for the clinton campaign by disclosing decisions in the clinton state department that favored large donors to the clinton foundation in what appear to be payforplay schemes of selling access and influence 
moreover the activity appears to coincide with lucrative speaking engagements for former president bill clinton",2016-11-07

pj media 
valerie jarrettbarack obamas closest consigliere who has lived in the lap of luxury in and out of the white houseis calling for james comeys head because the fbi director reopened the matter of hillary clintons emails only days before the election 
as we all know comey did this after some  digital missives many from clintons server were discovered on anthony weiners laptop by the nypd 
obama however is a bit uneasy about jarretts hawkishness toward comey 
valerie argued that comey was interfering deliberately in the election process and had to be stopped a source told the new york post  the same source said obama though is worried about the consequences of taking such an action  the tsunami of outrage that would come his way and possibly become a major footnote or worse in the history of the presidency 
ah those legacy problems not that the president has much of one outside the comically named affordable care act which is about as popular as stomach cancer 
nevertheless hes right about the tsunami of outrage in fact its an understatement the bad news is this as miserable as this endless election season has been the aftermath is likely to be far worse you dont have to be nostradamus to see that putting the american humpty dumpty together again is going to be a herculean task our country could be permanently fractured in ways few of us would have anticipated even a year ago anything is possible now 
if hillary clinton is elected the very next day millions of americans will be watching to see what will happen with the fbi and the justice department since we can now assume this will be a close election that would be nearly half the voters in this country sixty to seventy million people almost all of whom believe clinton the woman a few weeks from inauguration as president should have been charged with serious crimes and belonged behind bars not in the white house 
moreover many have seen the wikileaks that reek of collusion between the clintonistas and officials at the fbi and justice not to mention with virtually all the mainstream media outlets that were distrusted to begin with and are now reviled 
if thats not an explosive situation what is and we dont know what assange et al have in store for us after the election just now we learned that the clinton foundation acceptedwhile her ladyship was secretary of state and in honor of bills birthdayan unreported one million dollar donation from that paragon of womens and gay rights qatar this is chump change in the grand clinton scheme of things but another reminder of their unending greed and corruption more importantly as tyler durden points out this time there should be legal consequences for the foundationor would be normally in a country governed by the rule of law 
only were not anymore 
this and a thousand other things put obama quite possibly liable himself from the email disclosures and his attorney general lynch behind a treacherous eight ball going forward because they are not dealing with a few thousand disgruntled people but those many millions if they were to go ahead with jarretts suggestion take comeys head i e fire him and replace him with a yet more complaisant successor who knows what would happen 
but if they dont and even if they do the investigation may reveal things so shocking the nation will never be the same rumors have been flying that are so extreme that even a ten percent accuracy rate could ignite a firestorm 
the problem for all of us is that there is literally nothing clinton can do to get out of this box even if as many predict obama pardons her the corruption is so pervasive there is no way short of an actual military putsch to stop the continuing revelations and such an action would itself unleash  well you know the title of this article 
would a trump victory save us from all this no one knows dennis prager perhaps put it best when you have two doors and behind one is a maneating lion and the other one may or may not have such a lion which door do you choose unless you want to commit suicide the answer is selfevident",2016-11-07

npr 
janet reno the first woman to serve as attorney general of the united states died early monday from complications of parkinsons disease renos goddaughter gabrielle dalemberte and sister margaret hurchalla confirmed her passing to npr 
reno spent her final days at home in miami surrounded by family and friends dalemberte told the associated press she was  
reno served longer in the job than anyone had in  years and her tenure was marked by tragedy and controversy but she left office widely respected for her independence and accomplishments 
she was not president bill clintons first choice to head the justice department nor his second but after his no  pick went down in confirmation flames and his second choice also proved controversial clinton finally turned to reno 
she was an unexpected pick she had no connections to clinton or washington but clinton wanted a woman and reno was a bigtime prosecutor holding the top prosecutors job in miamidade county a position she had been elected to four times over  years 
jamie gorelick who would later become deputy attorney general was assigned to prep reno for her confirmation hearing she was the least airbrushed candidate we have ever had for a cabinetlevel position says gorelick she was herself and she didnt change herself for washington 
reno arrived at the justice department knowing no one and was immediately plunged into the siege at the branch davidian compound outside waco texas four federal agents had been killed and  wounded while serving a warrant to search for illegal guns seven weeks into the siege pressed by the fbi reno authorized a raid on the compound resulting in  deaths including as many as  children and the davidian leader david koresh who ordered his followers to set fire to the compound 
in two sets of waco congressional hearings over the next two years reno would successfully quell critics on the right and left 
what haunted me reno explained at one hearing was that if i did not go in i might be sitting there  days later  when koresh came out with explosives blew himself some agents and the entire place up 
years later however in an interview with npr shortly before leaving office her regret was palpable well never know whether it was a mistake or not in one sense reno admitted but knowing what i do i would not do it again i would try to figure another way 
waco didnt make her hesitant it made her insistent about getting her own information observes walter dellinger who served in two top justice department jobs under reno 
dellinger believes for instance that it may have been the waco experience that led reno to go personally to miami in april  to see if there was a way to avoid a forcible removal of yearold cuban refugee elián gonzález from the home of a greatuncle so the boy could be returned to his only living parent in cuba 
elián had been rescued at sea after his mother and eight others drowned trying to get to the united states rescued by fishermen and brought to the us he was soon turned over to his greatuncle the cuban community in miami was in an uproar over the idea of returning the boy to his father who lived in cuba and the furor soon bled over to congress 
but when negotiations with the greatuncle failed armed federal agents acting on renos orders raided the home removed elián and turned him over to his father who had come to the us to receive his son when the us supreme court refused to intervene the two returned to their home in cuba 
janet reno takes the oath as attorney general during a ceremony at the white house on march   while president bill clinton watches 
barry thummaap 
over the course of time reno would become embroiled in many controversies she sought the appointment of a series of independent counsels to investigate four fellow cabinet members and president clinton himself but she refused to authorize an independent counsel investigation of contributions to the clintongore campaign after justice department lawyers concluded no crime had been committed by either the president or vice president 
the decision so infuriated republicans that some called for her impeachment this is the most politicized justice department in the history of the united states railed dan burton the republican chairman of a key house oversight committee 
at  feet  inches however reno stood tall in the political crosswinds gorelick observes that when members of congress like burton were unhappy with a government official they threatened to call that official to testify but reno who had served as a staffer in the florida state legislature always said fine ill be there as a result says gorelick eventually all those who were threatening her with a hearing stopped doing that because she prevailed in every outing that i can recall  she just went in there and laid out her views and bested those who would challenge her 
the controversies that the justice department faced during renos reign often eclipsed the many things that went well the quick apprehension and successful prosecution of the oklahoma city bombers for example the pursuit of bombers of womens health clinics that provide abortions and the solving of the socalled unabomber case 
after nearly two decades of fruitless pursuit the fbi still had no idea as to the identity of the man dubbed the unabomber who had killed three people and injured  then in  the bomber sent a letter to the new york times offering to cease his terror campaign if the times or the washington post would publish his word manifesto against modern industry and technology neither newspaper was inclined to do that initially but reno the daughter of two newspaper journalists persuaded the newspaper owners to jointly publish the essay in the interests of public safety 
it paid off the unabombers brother recognized the style and ideas in the essay and tipped off the fbi ending the bombers long reign of terror theodore kaczynski aka the unabomber is now serving a life term in a maximum security federal prison 
in  reno was diagnosed with parkinsons disease she did not slow down but her hands sometimes shook so hard you could hear them knocking against the table at a congressional hearing she even joked about the disease claiming that shaking sometimes helps as in playing a steel drum or balancing her kayak 
that combination of toughness and selfdeprecating humor plus her determination to protect the justice department from improper influence made her a hero to many who worked for her 
janet reno led with her values says former deputy attorney general gorelick the departments no  official and that meant that if she decided that a certain path was the right thing to do the people around her believed her and would charge up any hill behind her  id never seen that before in quite the same way 
florida gubernatorial candidate and former us attorney general janet reno speaks at the florida democratic party state conference on april   in lake buena vista fla she lost the democratic primary 
reno won enormous respect inside the department as well because of her work ethic and dedication to understanding issues in the many parts of the justice department  from national security to environmental questions to the generally obscure field of indian law 
us attorney general loretta lynch called her one of the most effective decisive and wellrespectedleaders in the departments proud history who never shied from criticism or shirked responsibility and former attorney general eric holder said that in a city where too many compromise their values for short term political gain janet reno stood out as a person of integrity and of enduring values 
former solicitor general dellinger believes that reno was prepared for the attorney generals job early in life by her intellect and ungainly height this is a woman that went to cornell and harvard law school at a time when very few women went to harvard law school went through junior high and high school being twice as tall as anybody else and probably twice as smart  and thats really really tough 
there were of course ups and downs in the eight years of renos reign but she said she always took the long view of her job 
if the end brings me out right what people said about me wont make any difference and if the end brings me out wrong  angels saying i was right wont make any difference she said in an interview with npr in  
president clinton made little secret of his frequent displeasure with reno and the wall of separation she erected between the justice department and the white house still he never asked her to resign reno was the last cabinet member he reappointed after his reelection in  
it was actually quite wonderful said dellinger she just decided to stay and it turns out that nobody could fire her 
the tension between clinton and his attorney general was apparent even as clintons time in office drew to a close in an interview with cbs news  minutes  clinton went out of his way to praise friends and foes alike but when it came to his evaluation of reno he was tepid to say the least 
good woman he said tried really hard to do a good job shes a good person 
at least he didnt say i was a bad person replied reno with a laugh ill take what i can get 
indeed by the end of her tenure janet reno had outlasted her critics and earned such a reputation for integrity and independence that comedian will ferrells parody of her became one of the iconic skits on nbcs saturday night live  the recurring skit was inspired by reports that reno had cut quite a figure dancing at a justice department party

oklahoma has had thousands of earthquakes in recent years with nearly all traced to the underground injection of wastewater left over from oil and gas production sundays quake was centered  mile west of cushing and about  miles south of where a magnitude  quake forced a shutdown of several wells last week 
fearing aftershocks police cordoned off older parts of the city to keep gawkers away late sunday and geologists confirmed that several small quakes have rumbled the area frazier said an assisted living community had been evacuated after damage was reported the cushing public school district canceled monday classes 
stay out of the area said city manager steve spears who noted that while some damage was superficial compromised foundations and other potential problems would be difficult to assess until daylight in the city of  about  miles northeast of oklahoma city 
the oklahoma department of transportation reported sunday night that no highway or bridge damage was found within a mile radius of the earthquakes epicenter 
the quake struck at  pm sunday and was felt as far away as iowa illinois and texas the us geological survey initially said sundays quake was of magnitude  but later lowered the reading to

megan gustafson and jonathan gillespie were working at a cushing mcdonalds when the quake hit 
it felt like a train was going right through the building actually gustafson  said sunday night as she and her coworkers stood behind a police barricade downtown looking for damage i kind of freaked out and was hyperventilating a bit 
gillespie said the building shook for about  seconds but that he wasnt as alarmed as gustafson because he lives in an area that has experienced multiple earthquakes especially in recent years 
i didnt think it was anything new he said 
according to usgs data there have been about two dozen earthquakes in oklahoma in the past week when particularly strong quakes hit the oklahoma corporation commission directs well operators to cease wastewater injections or reduce volume

424,janet reno first female us attorney general dies at,"las vegas may become the new amsterdam  
high times 
nevada already has legal brothels roundtheclock casinos and a coy catchphrase declaring that what happens in vegas stays in vegas if voters approve the state could soon add another vice in the form of recreational marijuana 
a proposal on the nov  state ballot would legalize pot and entrepreneurs hope its passage could someday allow the drug at las vegas glamorous nightclubs and perhaps provide the framework for a future amsterdamstyle cannabis district 
i really think this would be the thirdlargest market in the country said derek peterson whose company operates medical marijuana dispensaries called blum he predicts that only california and new york would offer a bigger customer base than las vegas and its  million tourists a year i think it should be able to fit in really well with the whole dayclubnightclub thing 
nevada has allowed medical marijuana since  and peterson sees recreational pot as an alternative for visitors tired of cocktails that can top  apiece and inflict hangovers but before waitresses begin delivering highgrade marijuana at clubs along the las vegas strip weed proponents will have to win over not just voters who narrowly support the initiative in polls but a riskaverse casino industry 
the nevada resort association came out against the measure pointing to an opinion from gambling regulators that casino owners should avoid the marijuana industry because the substance remains illegal under federal law las vegas sands owner sheldon adelson has bankrolled most of the opposition pouring  million of his fortune into a campaign that raises the possibility that small children could become intoxicated from candylike marijuana edibles 
adelson also has contributed  million in arizona and massachusetts a significant share of all antimarijuana donations there 
adelson whose son died of a drug overdose and whose wife is a doctor specializing in drug addiction has donated millions toward efforts to defeat medical marijuana proposals in florida and other states in years past 
other casino operators have joined the fray but to a lesser extent 
in spite of its libertine reputation the rigorously regulated casino industry is known to err on the conservative side to avoid scandalizing the middleaged tourists who are its bread and butter 
i dont know that this is a game changer in terms of tourism virginia valentine president of the nevada resort association said of marijuanas potential were really known for other things you may attract people or turn them off 
the las vegas convention and visitors authority which promotes sin citys amenities to the world is neutral on the issue 
clyde barrow a gambling expert who chairs the political science department at the university of texasrio grande valley suggests the donations may indicate the casino companies are acting in their own best interests 
the marijuana industry is emerging as another form of recreation and entertainment given the casino industrys difficulties attracting millennials marijuana is probably perceived as a direct competitor with casinos for entertainment dollars he said another reason is that legalized marijuana competes with alcohol and to that extent competes with the food and beverage sales at casinos 
theres no solid statesponsored research on how legal recreational marijuana has affected tourism in places that have legalized it although both sides point to colorado to make their case 
promarijuana interests cite a state study that found colorado set an alltime tourism record in  capping a fifth year of growth its unclear how much of that is due to weed and how much can be chalked up to other factors such as good snow in recent years relative to competing ski states 
marijuana opponents refer to a report from the visit denver tourism bureau that logged increasing complaints about panhandling and open marijuana consumption in the citys downtown corridor 
denver is losing visitors and valuable convention business as a result of these overall safety or perception of safety issues the report said we fear not being able to brand denver away from this growing reputation 
nevadas ballot initiative would not allow municipalities to put blanket bans on marijuana as colorado does but it would bar consumption in buildings that are open to the public and permit local governments to restrict the locations of marijuana dispensaries and related businesses it effectively blocks people from growing their own by banning the practice within  miles of a licensed marijuana store",2016-11-07

press tv 
experts say the outlook for saudi economic recovery will remain murky for many months to come with some even warning that the worst of the economic slump for the kingdom is yet to come 
reuters in a report quoted several riyadhbased experts as saying that there would be a high degree of uncertainty over the status of the saudi economy in  that would mainly be a result of the remaining challenges from the private sector 
the saudi economy may appear to have escaped a fiscal and currency crisis that loomed at the start of  however experts said threats from certain basic problems still remain and will haunt the kingdom next year 
the government owes its success to temporarily escape crisis to unpaid bills rather than sustainable spending cuts 
the government has reduced or suspended payments that it owed to construction firms medical establishments and even some of the foreign consultants who helped to design the economic reforms reuters added quoting the experts the estimated unpaid dues for construction firms alone totaled  billion riyals 
experts further warned that this could store up obligations for riyadh in the future 
reuters elsewhere emphasized that signs of the economic slump could be seen in riyadh and other major cities where discounts of  percent or more are offered by stores selling clothes and consumer electronics and there is a surge in people offering secondhand cars for sale 
the biggest uncertainty may be how authorities can push through a key part of their reform drive added the report the most important issue for the saudis may be determining how they plan to foster a vibrant private sector that does not depend on oil revenues while at the same pushing ahead austerity policies that are suppressing private demand 
experts also warned that the status of the saudi job market over the next few years between  million and  million of saudi arabias  million foreign workers may leave over the next couple of years as the economic slowdown causes layoffs and the government seeks to steer saudi citizens into jobs previously held by foreigners reuters added",2016-11-07

while clinton and her advisers like to tout her small online donors it is these bundlers in more than  states and four foreign countries who form the true backbone of her financial operation combined this elite andup club has amassed a minimum of  million for clinton and the democratic party  and the actual figure is likely far far higher than that the biggest bundlers typically collect millions for campaigns

there are also federal lobbyists from whom the democratic party under obama refused to accept money a prohibition that has since been rolled back 
this club has expanded to the point where clinton would now struggle to fit all of these bundlers into a single ballroom as of the end of june she counted  such individuals and couples by the end of july it was  on august  it was

it was unclear whether abedin was referring to a serious ailment the new york post added 
in january  breitbart reported 
democrat frontrunner hillary clintons disappearance from the debate stage last month left people speculating that the former first lady took a long bathroom break but now a lawenforcement source with inside connections is alleging that clinton was missing from the stage due to health issues stemming from a previous brain injury 
these longlasting symptoms stemming from a concussion and blood clot according to a neurologist suggest clinton is suffering from postconcussion syndrome which can severely impact her cognitive abilities

democratic us vicepresidential nominee tim kaine announced saturday that he believes the catholic church will change its position on samesex marriage the virginia senator said that just like he had changed his opinion on the issue the catholic church is also likely to follow suit speaking at the th annual human rights campaigns national dinner in washington the roman catholic senator reportedly said i think its going to change because my church also teaches me about a creator who in the first chapter of genesis surveyed the entire world including mankind and said it is very good 
and besides he continued we are talking here about a country that was based and founded on democracy as a core value by definition that means that every single person and every single citizen is able  no scratch that  encouraged to practice his civil religious and above all sexual liberties to the best of their abilities and im sorry that some people dont like it but to deny samesex marriage in a country that should be the first one to accept it is just pointless and the catholic church should also be accepting it instead of condemning it which is what its doing right now 
kaine also added that if all else fails there are ways of making the catholic church listen to the voice of reason which is how he dubbed all those who advocate lgbt equality at the end of the day you know were a civilized people of course the first thing well do is act nicely and ask nicely he said then if that doesnt work well use our law and our legal system to enable ourselves to be who we are or rather the lbgt community will do that  and it has the supreme courts ruling on samesex marriage was a crucial milestone in our legal system that proves it works it actually functions 
so what im saying here he argued is that while i respect the catholic church as im sure millions of americans do you know at some point it is going to start acting contrary to the christian faith and were talking about an institution thats supposed to be the first one on the front line defending it so when that happens and thats whats happening with condemning lgbt rights well state an ultimatum the united states of america more precisely the future president of the united states of america hillary clinton will state an ultimatum and that ultimatum will be to either change its stance on samesex marriage or pack its bags and get out of america and yes  the president of the country can do that 
and in case anybodys wondering  no donald trump wont do the same because he doesnt care about anyone other than donald trump on the other hand hillary clinton is a shining example of honesty integrity and democracy and you can rest assured she will do everything in her power as the president to make sure gays and lesbians throughout america are loved respected and viewed as equals during her presidential term what happens after that is not our problem kaine concluded",2016-10-26

hillary clinton declared during nbc newss commanderinchief forum that no lives were lost in libya when she made the move to take out dictator muammar gaddafi even so the former secretary of state did not mention the fact that  months later four americans  including us ambassador christopher stevens  were killed in a terrorist attack in benghazi that arose from the instability that the overthrow created 
that was one of the few situations in american foreign policy decision making processes where everybody came together to make sure we dont make the wrong move and the operation was a success even donald trump supported it clinton argued as with any operation of such magnitude we had a few hiccups but it was nothing out of the ordinary as ive said the operation was a success 
she continued so much so in fact that im proud to say that no important people were lost through it all and when i say that i say it with the utmost respect for all those who had to give their lives on both sides so that libyans could be freed from the iron fist of gaddafi it would have been unrealistic to expect  casualties however the overall toll did not exceed expectations with the greater amount of damage being on the side of the enemy 
politics can be a cruel line of work that being said i stand before you here today and i am proud to say that giving democracy to a people that have not had any contact with it for generations is a wonderful thing that makes all of the sacrifices worth it and while were on the subject of sacrifices thank god they did not include anyone important from the american delegation including yours truly she said jokingly causing the auditorium to laugh 
she said but all jokes aside i have to pay homage to the cia who has once again performed outstandingly and saved the day its agents work in the field is an immeasurable contribution and an asset that we would be wise to treasure for generations to come if it hadnt been for them we would not have been able to perform the operation so cleanly and with such little impact to the surrounding nations i am proud that the united states of america has an intelligence agency such as the cia 
im sure many here among you disagree with my position that one embassy is a small price to pay a bargain if you will when it comes to ridding the world of another dictator and a terrorist i would also like to remind everyone here that that price would have gone up immeasurably if we had sat idly by and allowed gaddafi to rage on and cause death and destruction throughout the region for better of worse we acted and i am convinced no other dictator will ever again think about cheating the cia out of a deal because in the words of a personal friend of mine who is a former cia spook  shutting down arms dealers is easy finding trustworthy partners among nation heads is the hard part she concluded",2016-10-27

an internal memo released wednesday by wikileaks reveals how a longtime clinton confidant played an unorthodox dual role  raising money for the clinton foundation and finding paid work for bill clinton the hill reports 
the page document written in  by doug band of teneo a private consulting firm that raised millions for the foundation and also scouted out paid gigs for what was dubbed bill clinton inc the washington examiner reports 
in one instance band secured a  donation to the clinton foundation from banking giant ubs he later arranged for bill clinton to give three paid speeches to the firm for a total of  the hill reported 
but in his memo band argues his double duties were independent of one another the memo was written after chelsea clinton criticized bands role within the familys network of interests the hill reports 
in the unique roles in which we have had the opportunity to serve we have been able to help balance the multiplicity of activities that demand bill clintons time and engagement to best fulfill his personal political business official former president and foundationnonprofit goals band writes 
according to the hill teneos overlapping responsibilities worried some in the clintons inner circle and in one email published by wikileaks chelsea clinton raised serious concerns with teneos liberal use of the clinton name to court clients 
band lashed out calling the former first daughter a meddlesome spoiled brat in one hacked email released by wikileaks 
we appreciate the unorthodox nature of our roles and the goal of seeking ways to ensure we are implementing best practices to protect the tax exempt status of the foundation band wrote in his memo to justify his role and bat back criticism the hill reports 
band cofounded teneo with former state department employee declan kelly while hillary clinton was secretary of state  and paid bill clinton as an adviser through  the hill reports 
bands memo lists several teneo clients that he and kelly leveraged into major donors for the foundation and also details the personal introductions the two principals made between the clintons and the prospective donors the hill reports 
one that kelly cultivated was cocacola ceo muhtar kent which led to sevenfigure donations beginning in  
in a previous hacked email to hillary clinton campaign chairman john podesta band worried the press might catch wind of his role and misconstrue it

it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow her or bill to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal email server to gunrunning to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi 
apparently hillary is not the only person in washington who has made plans to escape justice under a trump administration john kerry has quietly been selling his property in the us for millions of dollars of late with an announcement of the sale of his  million nantucket mansion in june  as well as the sale of his yacht for  million in july  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million seaside mansion in dubai in january  another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed but the truth has a way of coming out on its own as it always has 
the bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of  acres in paraguay in  yet another country good for the bush family since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime if the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the bush administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on  the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request apparently if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous the bushs plan on getting out of the country as well 
interestingly the bush familys nazi connections dating back to wwii seem to have played a part in the paraguay purchase since most nazis fled to south america after wwii since george h w bushs father senator prescott bush was director and shareholder in companies that were connected with institutions financially backing the nazis the bush family has a long history of being associated with nazis 
with the movement of huge amounts of funds selling millions of dollars in real estate and the purchase of millions in real estate overseas we are seeing the plans of the corrupt in washington who have been ripping of our country in the trillions murdering us citizens in the thousands and citizens in foreign countries by the millions since  finally realizing their crimes against humanity is about to be exposed 
we are also witnessing the change from what amounts to nothing more than a nazi dictatorship in washington to an actual presidential administration who not only will look to the constitution as the basis of all laws but one who is going to prosecute the criminals in our government and return it to being a government by the people for the people and of the people of the usa not the dictatorship over the people to the people and who disregards the people as we now have in power",2016-10-27

two bill clinton cronies used their private consulting firm to steer millions in business to the former president while raising funds for the clinton foundation  and even called the arrangement bill clinton inc 
doug band a top clinton aide detailed the complex financial arrangement between his company teneo and the foundation in a memo contained in hacked emails released wednesday by wikileaks 
teneo partners have raised in excess of  million for the foundation more than  million of which is in the bank the memo reads 
teneo partners also have generated over  million in paid speeches for president clinton  million of which has been paid to him thus far 
the consulting company was formed by band and former state department envoy declan kelly the memo about its activities shows the incestuous relationship between the foundation and the private business interests of the former president 
in one arrangement kelly introduced bob mccann the head of ubs wealth management to clinton at an event in  
after the meeting mccann donated hundreds of thousands to the foundation while inviting clinton to give several paid speeches 
another arrangement involved the laureate foundation which donated more than  million to the clinton global initiative 
laureate was a personal advisory services business the memo said paying clinton ?million annually to provide advice and serve as their honorary chairman 
the cozy relationship with the clintons put the baltimorebased laureate at highprofile events with international players who could help it expand its reach around the globe 
the band memo also includes a section about forprofit activity of president clinton ie bill clinton inc 
some of the speeches secured by teneo include two  addresses delivered to ubs in  and  as well as a commitment for three additional paid speeches if he chose to give them 
another secured event was a  million fee for clinton to speak at two onehour sessions during an event in hong kong the fee included  for a private plane 
since  president clintons business arrangements have yielded more than  million for him personally with  million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements the memo reads 
the relationship between band and the donors was criticized harshly by daughter chelsea clinton in another email 
chelsea specifically called out band and teneo for hustling business opportunities out of the foundation 
i continue to want  and to try  to disintermediate myself from this muddle edify the corporate audit and existential process we are in  while also being a responsible board member daughter and person chelsea wrote in the  email

democratic vice president joe biden wants american women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy if we just put all the women back to work if they were able to afford childcare we would increase the gdp in america by close to eight tenths of one percent he said thats trillions of dollars over the next decade 
biden made his remarks during a campaign event for hillary clinton at chatham university in pittsburgh pennsylvania on tuesday the state of our economy could be characterized by a single word pitiful he argued were still battling recession i dont care what the official stats are saying america is still in recession and were not doing anything about it 
he added that it was lazy american women who brought about the downfall of the economy because they sit around on their behinds doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them im not sure how exactly we got to this point but were here and we need to move like yesterday he said 
mark my words and mark them well he addressed the crowd hillary clinton is the only one who can force american women to go to work this is true because of a number of reasons first shes a woman herself and not just any woman shes a selfmade woman so you better believe what shes saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times 
second hillary clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a freeloader when your husband is the breadwinner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house the children make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties shes been all that and shes learned how to break free from it the hard way i might add biden continued 
todays women are pampered and arent used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own the vice president said theyre too dependent too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy the reason for that is theyve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics when a soughtafter commodity becomes short in supply the demand for it rises even higher 
now thats all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests but if you look at the big picture its the economy thats missing out on valuable workforce and thats why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces and like i said hillary clinton is the only one who can do it which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next president of the united states we need to heal this country folks not run it into the ground even deeper biden concluded",2016-10-27

republican presidential candidate donald trump signaled thursday plans to seek nationwide changes to school curricula with the goal of promoting american pride and patriotism in americas schools 
in a trump administration i plan to work directly with the american legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to americas children trump said speaking at the american legions annual convention in cincinnati 
we want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of americas history its institutions and its heroes many of whom are with us today he told the veterans group 
the comments suggested a federal government intervention in the programs of locally run schools which is prohibited under federal lawwe will stop apologizing for america and we will start celebrating america we will be united by our common culture values and principles becoming one american nation one country under one constitution saluting one american flag and always saluting it trump said 
last year a denverarea school board sought to change the content of the ap us history course because some board members thought it failed to promote patriotism 
that sparked a political proxy war in jefferson county colorado and the  school board election drew nearly  million in campaign funding from outside interest groups 
public schools nationwide are funded by their local communities along with some state money most schools receive little federal funding

donald trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the november election will be rigged against him 
of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day trump tweeted monday morning why do republican leaders deny what is going on so naive 
its a charge that even other republicans have been quick to refute critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the us democratic process 
states backed by tens of thousands of gop and dem volunteers ensure integrity of electoral process sen jeff flake of arizona who is often sharply critical of trump tweeted sunday elections are not rigged 
jon husted the secretary of state of ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state also said monday that he could assure trump the election would not be rigged 
trumps most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls before now trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early august 
and im telling you november  wed better be careful because that election is going to be rigged the new york billionaire told fox news host sean hannity in august and i hope the republicans are watching closely or its going to be taken away from us 
multiple republicans told business insider at the time that trumps assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous as trump would be the first us presidential candidate in modern times possibly ever to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election 
allen raymond a former gop operative who was involved in the  new hampshire senate election phonejamming scandal called trumps continued insistence that the election would be rigged detrimental to the republic 
the idea that its rigged i dont know what hes talking about he said in august i know someone that rigged elections i mean you know the fact of the matter is hillary clinton doesnt need to rig this election trumps going to win alabama and thats it she doesnt have to do anything its painful to watch 
raymond wrote how to rig an election confessions of a republican operative as a tellall about the attempt to rig the  new hampshire senate election between thengov jeanne shaheen a democrat and republican us rep john e sununu raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the new hampshire democrats office in manchester  a task his phone bank was hired to carry out sununu went on to win the election by roughly  votes shaheen defeated sununu in a rematch in  
the operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvementhe said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that  not what trumps talking about 
the manhattan billionaire told the washington post in august that a lack of voteridentification laws would let people just keep voting and voting and voting and suggested fraud occurred in  against republican nominee mitt romney because there were precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the republican 
i dont even know what hes talking about raymond said but this idea that its  or  and the party bosses are going to roll into pittsburgh and philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines  thats nonsense an election rigging these days means something totally different than what hes talking about now its stupid stuff like what i did in new hampshire 
he said the lack of voterid laws trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus 
these voterid laws whats the intention of that the clear intention is disenfranchisement he said echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voterid laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots you know theres a reason we dont have a poll tax anymore because its unconstitutional 
people dont vote  times he continued there might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times but hes talking about an institutional effort its a total myth 
he said trumps statements were an attempt to basically sideline hillary clintons first four years in office 
the idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the democratic national committee had its emails hacked and leaked though both trump and sen bernie sanders of vermont clintons main opponent in the democratic primary had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season the emails showed that the organization which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary favored clinton 
trump said the email leak proved that the primary election was rigged against sanders in his earlyaugust interview with hannity in addition to such claims he perpetuated along the campaign trail he used the leak as further evidence that the fall election would be rigged against him as well",2016-10-27

leading republican presidential hopeful suggests israelipalestinian peace accord may be impossible sometimes agreements cant be madeafter being asked by a voter at a charleston south carolina town hall event hosted by msnbc about what steps he would take to broker an accommodation between the sides in the conflict the gop contender vowed to give it one hell of a shot and called it probably the toughest agreement of any kind to makebut when pressed by host joe scarborough over whether he ascribed fault to either israelis or palestinians over the failure to reach a lasting accord trump declined to take sides 
you know i dont want to get into it because  if i win i dont want to be in a position where im saying to you and the other side now says we dont want trump involved trump said 
let me be sort of a neutral guy he continued a lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal so i dont want to say whose fault is it i dont think it helpstrump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a twostate solution given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time 
its possible its not makeable because dont forget it has to last  its wonderful to make it and it doesnt work but it has to last he said to make lasting peace there probably the toughest deal of all but im going to give it a shot 
though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate and what he considers the root of the conflict 
a lot of people say an agreement cant be made which is okay i mean sometimes agreements cant be made not good but you know you have both sides really but one side in particular growing up and learning that these are the worst people he said i was with a very prominent israeli the other day he says its impossible because the other side has been trained from the time theyre children to hate jewish peoplein the past trump has questioned israels commitment to peace while at the same time suggesting the jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the palestinians he has also called prime minister benjamin netanyahu a good friend 
at a presidential candidates forum hosted by the republican jewish coalition in december  the real estate magnate said i dont know that israel has the commitment to make it and i dont know that the other side has the commitment to make it 
he made the same point in an interview with ap earlier that day a lot will have to do with israel and whether or not israel wants to make the deal  whether or not israels willing to sacrifice certain things he said they may not be and i understand that and im okay with that but then youre just not going to have a deal

former president bill clinton can be heard telling his former mistress gennifer flowers to deny that he helped her get a state job in a series of recorded phone conversation from  
if they ever asked if youd talked to me about it you can say no clinton is heard saying in the recording 
at the time the media was making inquiries about flowers alleged affair with clinton and she was concerned that they may question how she got a job as administrative assistant for the arkansas appeal tribunal 
clinton can also be heard telling flowers how to handle a grievance filed by soemone else who applied for the same positioned and claimed she was more qualified than flowers 
flowers famously recorded a series of conversation she had with clinton from december  to december  while he was still governor of arkansas the audio segments about the state job were widely reported in the s however as other payforplay financial scandals have surfaced the details may warrant revisiting 

here is a transcript of part of the recording 
gf  but anyway then wednesday there was a grievance filed in my office when i got the job by a girl who felt like she should have gotten it a black girl named deleted and they called me as a witness so i go in and uh nothing big came of it its just that they were questioning me about how i found out about the job and i said well that personnel said it that it was a possibility there would be a position and then uh they told me that it would be advertised in the newspaper and it was and i pursued it from there 
bc  good for you 
gf yeah we had a little bit of a scare recently because she had a spot on an xray and she went and had it checked again and it wasnt cancer and its been almost itll be two years in may that shes now diagnosed cancer free my stepfather has been through two angioplasties but hes doing good and i am im really bill what im afraid of is that if somebody in the press finds out that im working for the state 
bc  yeah

democratic us vicepresidential nominee tim kaine announced saturday that he believes the catholic church will change its position on samesex marriage the virginia senator said that just like he had changed his opinion on the issue the catholic church is also likely to follow suit speaking at the th annual human rights campaigns national dinner in washington the roman catholic senator reportedly said i think its going to change because my church also teaches me about a creator who in the first chapter of genesis surveyed the entire world including mankind and said it is very good 
and besides he continued we are talking here about a country that was based and founded on democracy as a core value by definition that means that every single person and every single citizen is able  no scratch that  encouraged to practice his civil religious and above all sexual liberties to the best of their abilities and im sorry that some people dont like it but to deny samesex marriage in a country that should be the first one to accept it is just pointless and the catholic church should also be accepting it instead of condemning it which is what its doing right now 
kaine also added that if all else fails there are ways of making the catholic church listen to the voice of reason which is how he dubbed all those who advocate lgbt equality at the end of the day you know were a civilized people of course the first thing well do is act nicely and ask nicely he said then if that doesnt work well use our law and our legal system to enable ourselves to be who we are or rather the lbgt community will do that  and it has the supreme courts ruling on samesex marriage was a crucial milestone in our legal system that proves it works it actually functions 
so what im saying here he argued is that while i respect the catholic church as im sure millions of americans do you know at some point it is going to start acting contrary to the christian faith and were talking about an institution thats supposed to be the first one on the front line defending it so when that happens and thats whats happening with condemning lgbt rights well state an ultimatum the united states of america more precisely the future president of the united states of america hillary clinton will state an ultimatum and that ultimatum will be to either change its stance on samesex marriage or pack its bags and get out of america and yes  the president of the country can do that 
and in case anybodys wondering  no donald trump wont do the same because he doesnt care about anyone other than donald trump on the other hand hillary clinton is a shining example of honesty integrity and democracy and you can rest assured she will do everything in her power as the president to make sure gays and lesbians throughout america are loved respected and viewed as equals during her presidential term what happens after that is not our problem kaine concluded",2016-10-27

an internal memo released wednesday by wikileaks reveals how a longtime clinton confidant played an unorthodox dual role  raising money for the clinton foundation and finding paid work for bill clinton the hill reports 
the page document written in  by doug band of teneo a private consulting firm that raised millions for the foundation and also scouted out paid gigs for what was dubbed bill clinton inc the washington examiner reports 
in one instance band secured a  donation to the clinton foundation from banking giant ubs he later arranged for bill clinton to give three paid speeches to the firm for a total of  the hill reported 
but in his memo band argues his double duties were independent of one another the memo was written after chelsea clinton criticized bands role within the familys network of interests the hill reports 
in the unique roles in which we have had the opportunity to serve we have been able to help balance the multiplicity of activities that demand bill clintons time and engagement to best fulfill his personal political business official former president and foundationnonprofit goals band writes 
according to the hill teneos overlapping responsibilities worried some in the clintons inner circle and in one email published by wikileaks chelsea clinton raised serious concerns with teneos liberal use of the clinton name to court clients 
band lashed out calling the former first daughter a meddlesome spoiled brat in one hacked email released by wikileaks 
we appreciate the unorthodox nature of our roles and the goal of seeking ways to ensure we are implementing best practices to protect the tax exempt status of the foundation band wrote in his memo to justify his role and bat back criticism the hill reports 
band cofounded teneo with former state department employee declan kelly while hillary clinton was secretary of state  and paid bill clinton as an adviser through  the hill reports 
bands memo lists several teneo clients that he and kelly leveraged into major donors for the foundation and also details the personal introductions the two principals made between the clintons and the prospective donors the hill reports 
one that kelly cultivated was cocacola ceo muhtar kent which led to sevenfigure donations beginning in

it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow her or bill to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal email server to gunrunning to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi 
apparently hillary is not the only person in washington who has made plans to escape justice under a trump administration john kerry has quietly been selling his property in the us for millions of dollars of late with an announcement of the sale of his  million nantucket mansion in june  as well as the sale of his yacht for  million in july  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million seaside mansion in dubai in january  another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed but the truth has a way of coming out on its own as it always has 
the bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of  acres in paraguay in  yet another country good for the bush family since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime if the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the bush administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on  the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request apparently if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous the bushs plan on getting out of the country as well 
interestingly the bush familys nazi connections dating back to wwii seem to have played a part in the paraguay purchase since most nazis fled to south america after wwii since george h w bushs father senator prescott bush was director and shareholder in companies that were connected with institutions financially backing the nazis the bush family has a long history of being associated with nazis 
with the movement of huge amounts of funds selling millions of dollars in real estate and the purchase of millions in real estate overseas we are seeing the plans of the corrupt in washington who have been ripping of our country in the trillions murdering us citizens in the thousands and citizens in foreign countries by the millions since  finally realizing their crimes against humanity is about to be exposed 
we are also witnessing the change from what amounts to nothing more than a nazi dictatorship in washington to an actual presidential administration who not only will look to the constitution as the basis of all laws but one who is going to prosecute the criminals in our government and return it to being a government by the people for the people and of the people of the usa not the dictatorship over the people to the people and who disregards the people as we now have in power",2016-10-27

teneo partners have raised in excess of  million for the foundation more than  million of which is in the bank the memo reads 
teneo partners also have generated over  million in paid speeches for president clinton  million of which has been paid to him thus far 
the consulting company was formed by band and former state department envoy declan kelly the memo about its activities shows the incestuous relationship between the foundation and the private business interests of the former president 
in one arrangement kelly introduced bob mccann the head of ubs wealth management to clinton at an event in  
after the meeting mccann donated hundreds of thousands to the foundation while inviting clinton to give several paid speeches 
another arrangement involved the laureate foundation which donated more than  million to the clinton global initiative 
laureate was a personal advisory services business the memo said paying clinton ?million annually to provide advice and serve as their honorary chairman 
the cozy relationship with the clintons put the baltimorebased laureate at highprofile events with international players who could help it expand its reach around the globe 
the band memo also includes a section about forprofit activity of president clinton ie bill clinton inc 
some of the speeches secured by teneo include two  addresses delivered to ubs in  and  as well as a commitment for three additional paid speeches if he chose to give them 
another secured event was a  million fee for clinton to speak at two onehour sessions during an event in hong kong the fee included  for a private plane 
since  president clintons business arrangements have yielded more than  million for him personally with  million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements the memo reads

democratic vice president joe biden wants american women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy if we just put all the women back to work if they were able to afford childcare we would increase the gdp in america by close to eight tenths of one percent he said thats trillions of dollars over the next decade 
biden made his remarks during a campaign event for hillary clinton at chatham university in pittsburgh pennsylvania on tuesday the state of our economy could be characterized by a single word pitiful he argued were still battling recession i dont care what the official stats are saying america is still in recession and were not doing anything about it 
he added that it was lazy american women who brought about the downfall of the economy because they sit around on their behinds doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them im not sure how exactly we got to this point but were here and we need to move like yesterday he said 
mark my words and mark them well he addressed the crowd hillary clinton is the only one who can force american women to go to work this is true because of a number of reasons first shes a woman herself and not just any woman shes a selfmade woman so you better believe what shes saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times 
second hillary clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a freeloader when your husband is the breadwinner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house the children make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties shes been all that and shes learned how to break free from it the hard way i might add biden continued 
todays women are pampered and arent used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own the vice president said theyre too dependent too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy the reason for that is theyve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics when a soughtafter commodity becomes short in supply the demand for it rises even higher 
now thats all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests but if you look at the big picture its the economy thats missing out on valuable workforce and thats why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces and like i said hillary clinton is the only one who can do it which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next president of the united states we need to heal this country folks not run it into the ground even deeper biden concluded",2016-10-27

that sparked a political proxy war in jefferson county colorado and the  school board election drew nearly  million in campaign funding from outside interest groups

donald trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the november election will be rigged against him 
of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day trump tweeted monday morning why do republican leaders deny what is going on so naive 
its a charge that even other republicans have been quick to refute critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the us democratic process 
states backed by tens of thousands of gop and dem volunteers ensure integrity of electoral process sen jeff flake of arizona who is often sharply critical of trump tweeted sunday elections are not rigged 
jon husted the secretary of state of ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state also said monday that he could assure trump the election would not be rigged 
trumps most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls before now trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early august 
and im telling you november  wed better be careful because that election is going to be rigged the new york billionaire told fox news host sean hannity in august and i hope the republicans are watching closely or its going to be taken away from us 
multiple republicans told business insider at the time that trumps assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous as trump would be the first us presidential candidate in modern times possibly ever to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election 
allen raymond a former gop operative who was involved in the  new hampshire senate election phonejamming scandal called trumps continued insistence that the election would be rigged detrimental to the republic 
the idea that its rigged i dont know what hes talking about he said in august i know someone that rigged elections i mean you know the fact of the matter is hillary clinton doesnt need to rig this election trumps going to win alabama and thats it she doesnt have to do anything its painful to watch 
raymond wrote how to rig an election confessions of a republican operative as a tellall about the attempt to rig the  new hampshire senate election between thengov jeanne shaheen a democrat and republican us rep john e sununu raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the new hampshire democrats office in manchester  a task his phone bank was hired to carry out sununu went on to win the election by roughly  votes shaheen defeated sununu in a rematch in  
the operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvementhe said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that  not what trumps talking about 
the manhattan billionaire told the washington post in august that a lack of voteridentification laws would let people just keep voting and voting and voting and suggested fraud occurred in  against republican nominee mitt romney because there were precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the republican 
i dont even know what hes talking about raymond said but this idea that its  or  and the party bosses are going to roll into pittsburgh and philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines  thats nonsense an election rigging these days means something totally different than what hes talking about now its stupid stuff like what i did in new hampshire 
he said the lack of voterid laws trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus 
these voterid laws whats the intention of that the clear intention is disenfranchisement he said echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voterid laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots you know theres a reason we dont have a poll tax anymore because its unconstitutional 
people dont vote  times he continued there might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times but hes talking about an institutional effort its a total myth 
he said trumps statements were an attempt to basically sideline hillary clintons first four years in office 
the idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the democratic national committee had its emails hacked and leaked though both trump and sen bernie sanders of vermont clintons main opponent in the democratic primary had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season the emails showed that the organization which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary favored clinton 
trump said the email leak proved that the primary election was rigged against sanders in his earlyaugust interview with hannity in addition to such claims he perpetuated along the campaign trail he used the leak as further evidence that the fall election would be rigged against him as well",2016-10-27

leading republican presidential hopeful suggests israelipalestinian peace accord may be impossible sometimes agreements cant be madeafter being asked by a voter at a charleston south carolina town hall event hosted by msnbc about what steps he would take to broker an accommodation between the sides in the conflict the gop contender vowed to give it one hell of a shot and called it probably the toughest agreement of any kind to makebut when pressed by host joe scarborough over whether he ascribed fault to either israelis or palestinians over the failure to reach a lasting accord trump declined to take sides 
you know i dont want to get into it because  if i win i dont want to be in a position where im saying to you and the other side now says we dont want trump involved trump said 
let me be sort of a neutral guy he continued a lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal so i dont want to say whose fault is it i dont think it helpstrump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a twostate solution given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time 
its possible its not makeable because dont forget it has to last  its wonderful to make it and it doesnt work but it has to last he said to make lasting peace there probably the toughest deal of all but im going to give it a shot 
though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate and what he considers the root of the conflict 
a lot of people say an agreement cant be made which is okay i mean sometimes agreements cant be made not good but you know you have both sides really but one side in particular growing up and learning that these are the worst people he said i was with a very prominent israeli the other day he says its impossible because the other side has been trained from the time theyre children to hate jewish peoplein the past trump has questioned israels commitment to peace while at the same time suggesting the jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the palestinians he has also called prime minister benjamin netanyahu a good friend 
at a presidential candidates forum hosted by the republican jewish coalition in december  the real estate magnate said i dont know that israel has the commitment to make it and i dont know that the other side has the commitment to make it 
he made the same point in an interview with ap earlier that day a lot will have to do with israel and whether or not israel wants to make the deal  whether or not israels willing to sacrifice certain things he said they may not be and i understand that and im okay with that but then youre just not going to have a deal

hillary clinton declared during nbc newss commanderinchief forum that no lives were lost in libya when she made the move to take out dictator muammar gaddafi even so the former secretary of state did not mention the fact that  months later four americans  including us ambassador christopher stevens  were killed in a terrorist attack in benghazi that arose from the instability that the overthrow created 
that was one of the few situations in american foreign policy decision making processes where everybody came together to make sure we dont make the wrong move and the operation was a success even donald trump supported it clinton argued as with any operation of such magnitude we had a few hiccups but it was nothing out of the ordinary as ive said the operation was a success 
she continued so much so in fact that im proud to say that no important people were lost through it all and when i say that i say it with the utmost respect for all those who had to give their lives on both sides so that libyans could be freed from the iron fist of gaddafi it would have been unrealistic to expect  casualties however the overall toll did not exceed expectations with the greater amount of damage being on the side of the enemy 
politics can be a cruel line of work that being said i stand before you here today and i am proud to say that giving democracy to a people that have not had any contact with it for generations is a wonderful thing that makes all of the sacrifices worth it and while were on the subject of sacrifices thank god they did not include anyone important from the american delegation including yours truly she said jokingly causing the auditorium to laugh 
she said but all jokes aside i have to pay homage to the cia who has once again performed outstandingly and saved the day its agents work in the field is an immeasurable contribution and an asset that we would be wise to treasure for generations to come if it hadnt been for them we would not have been able to perform the operation so cleanly and with such little impact to the surrounding nations i am proud that the united states of america has an intelligence agency such as the cia 
im sure many here among you disagree with my position that one embassy is a small price to pay a bargain if you will when it comes to ridding the world of another dictator and a terrorist i would also like to remind everyone here that that price would have gone up immeasurably if we had sat idly by and allowed gaddafi to rage on and cause death and destruction throughout the region for better of worse we acted and i am convinced no other dictator will ever again think about cheating the cia out of a deal because in the words of a personal friend of mine who is a former cia spook  shutting down arms dealers is easy finding trustworthy partners among nation heads is the hard part she concluded",2016-10-27

493,charlotte area counties report voting machines picking wrong candidates,"email 

an email published by wikileaks on friday reveals the extent to which democrats and their allies manipulate polls to serve their ends 
the  email appears shows democratic operatives plotting to intentionally oversample seniors in a poll in order to get their desired results 
fyi we are going to try to do an oversample of seniors on the poll sample too small otherwise operative tom matzzie wrote to clinton adviser paul begala campaign chairman john podesta media matters for america founder david brock and operative susan mccue good begala responded 
trump and his supporters have claimed often that many polls showing a significant hillary lead over trump have been manipulated through selective sampling there is ample evidence that this occurs in democratfriendly newsrooms 
hillary clinton has opened up a point lead over donald trump in an online poll that seems to reflect a bounce for the former secretary of state after she wrapped up the democratic nomination last week the daily mail reported in june 
but the weekly tracking poll from nbc news and the surveymonkey company included the opinions of  percent more selfidentified democrats than republicans  the same margin as the polls topline result the article noted 
the email released by wikileaks friday proves that democratic operatives themselves engage eagerly in such tactics 
polls are a powerful propaganda tool and people exposed repeatedly to polls suggesting their candidates loss is a foregone conclusion will often be influenced to stay home on election day 
i think sometimes polling is done to dampen election turnout rand paul said in an interview on wednesday on the tom roten show out of west virginia when we say over and over someone cant win that is a form of rigging in the sense that it is designed to suppress turnout he added",2016-10-28

an email published by wikileaks on friday reveals the extent to which democrats and their allies manipulate polls to serve their ends 
the  email appears shows democratic operatives plotting to intentionally oversample seniors in a poll in order to get their desired results 
fyi we are going to try to do an oversample of seniors on the poll sample too small otherwise operative tom matzzie wrote to clinton adviser paul begala campaign chairman john podesta media matters for america founder david brock and operative susan mccue good begala responded 
trump and his supporters have claimed often that many polls showing a significant hillary lead over trump have been manipulated through selective sampling there is ample evidence that this occurs in democratfriendly newsrooms 
hillary clinton has opened up a point lead over donald trump in an online poll that seems to reflect a bounce for the former secretary of state after she wrapped up the democratic nomination last week the daily mail reported in june 
but the weekly tracking poll from nbc news and the surveymonkey company included the opinions of  percent more selfidentified democrats than republicans  the same margin as the polls topline result the article noted 
the email released by wikileaks friday proves that democratic operatives themselves engage eagerly in such tactics 
polls are a powerful propaganda tool and people exposed repeatedly to polls suggesting their candidates loss is a foregone conclusion will often be influenced to stay home on election day 
i think sometimes polling is done to dampen election turnout rand paul said in an interview on wednesday on the tom roten show out of west virginia when we say over and over someone cant win that is a form of rigging in the sense that it is designed to suppress turnout he added",2016-10-28

queen elizabeth ii is not like you and me 
did you know she is immune from prosecution that she has her own personal poet paid in sherry wine or that she holds dominion over british swans and can fire the entire australian government 
its true that her role as the british head of state is largely ceremonial and the monarch no longer holds any serious power from day to day the historic prerogative powers of the sovereign have been devolved largely to government ministers but this still means that when the british government declares war or regulates the civil service or signs a treaty it is doing so only on her authority 
and she still wields some of these prerogative powers herself  as well as numerous other unique powers ranging from the surprising to the utterly bizarre 
most famously she owns all swans in the river thames 
technically all unmarked swans in open water belong to the queen though the crown exercises her ownership only on certain stretches of the thames and its surrounding tributaries according to the official website of the royal family 
today this tradition is observed during the annual swan upping in which swans in the river thames are caught ringed and set free again as part of census of the swan population 
its a highly ceremonial affair taking place over five days swan uppers wear traditional uniforms and row upriver in six skiffs accompanied by the queens swan marker 
the swans are also given a health check and ringed with individual identification numbers by the queens swan warden a professor of ornithology at the university of oxfords department of zoology according to the royal family website 
rule britannia britannia rules the waves goes a classic british song  and this rule extends beneath the waves too the sovereign has dominion over a variety of aquatic animals in british waters 
the queen still technically owns all the sturgeons whales and dolphins in the waters around england and wales in a rule that dates back to a statute from  during the reign of king edward ii according to time 
according to the article this statute is still valid today and sturgeons porpoises whales and dolphins are recognised as fishes royal when they are captured within  miles about  km of uk shores or wash ashore they may be claimed on behalf of the crown generally when brought into port a sturgeon is sold in the usual way and the purchaser as a gesture of loyalty requests the honour of its being accepted by elizabeth 
the law is still observed in  a welsh fisherman was investigated by the police after catching a foot sturgeon the bbc reported at the time the scottish government also issued guidance on the law in  writing that the right to claim royal fish in scotland allows the scottish government on behalf of the crown to claim stranded whales which are too large to be drawn to land by a wain pulled by six oxen 
the queen can drive without a licence 
driving licenses are issued in the queens name yet she is the only person in the united kingdom who doesnt legally need a license to drive or a number plate on her cars according to time 
despite not being required to have a license the queen is comfortable behind the wheel having learned to drive during world war ii when she operated a firstaid truck for the womens auxillary territorial service as a result of the queens training she can also change a spark plug time notes 
queen elizabeth ii isnt afraid to show off her driving skills either in  she surprised king abdullah of saudi arabia then still a prince by driving him around in her country seat of balmoral 
former british ambassador sherard cowpercoles recounted the meeting in the sunday times as instructed the crown prince climbed into the front seat of the front land rover with his interpreter in the seat behind to his surprise the queen climbed into the driving seat turned the ignition and drove off women are not  yet  allowed to drive in saudi arabia and abdullah was not used to being driven by a woman let alone a queen 
cowpercoles continued his nervousness only increased as the queen an army driver in wartime accelerated the land rover along the narrow scottish estate roads talking all the time through his interpreter the crown prince implored the queen to slow down and concentrate on the road ahead 
unlike other members of the royal family the queen does not require a passport as they are issued in her name despite this lack of travel documents she has been abroad many times 
she has two birthdays 
when youre the british head of state one birthday just isnt enough the queens official birthday is celebrated on a saturday in june though her actual birthday is on april  
official celebrations to mark a sovereigns birthday have often been held on a day other than the actual birthday particularly when the actual birthday has not been in the summer according to the royal mint 
both birthdays are celebrated in suitable style too her actual birthday is marked publicly by gun salutes in central london at midday according to the official website of the british monarchy this includes a gun salute in hyde park a gun salute in windsor great park and a gun salute at the tower of london in  her majesty celebrated her th birthday in  with a walkabout in the streets outside of windsor castle to meet wellwishers 
for her official birthday celebrations meanwhile she is joined by other members of the royal family at the spectacular trooping the colour parade which moves between buckingham palace the mall and horseguards parade 
she has her own private cash machine 
less a power and more a perk of the job a private cash machine for use by the royal family is installed in the basement of buckingham palace its provided by coutts one of britains most prestigious  and exclusive  banks 
the queen has her own personal poet 
the poet laureate is an honorary position in british society appointed by the monarch to a poet whose work is of national significance according to the official website of the british monarchy when first the role was introduced the appointee was paid  per year plus a butt of canary wine today the poet laureate is given a barrel of sherry 
carol ann duffy will hold the position until  
she has to sign laws 
the queens consent is necessary to turn any bill into an actual law once a proposed law has passed both houses of parliament it makes its way to the palace for approval which is called royal assent the most recent british monarch to refuse to provide royal assent was queen anne back in  
royal assent is different than queens consent in which the queen must consent to any law being debated in parliament that affects the monarchys interests such as reforming the prerogative or tax laws that might affect the duchy of cornwall for example without consent the bill cannot be debated in parliament 
queens consent is exercised only on the advice of ministers but its existence provides the government with a tool for blocking debate on certain subjects if bills are tabled by backbench rebels or the opposition 
it has been exercised at least  times according to documents released under the freedom of information act including one instance in which the queen completely vetoed the military actions against iraq bill in  a private members bill that sought to transfer the power to authorise military strikes against iraq from the monarch to parliament the guardian reported in  
she can create lords 
the queen has the power to appoint lords who can then sit in parliament the upper house in britains legislative system like many other powers this is exercised only on the advice of elected government ministers 
she doesnt have to pay tax but she does anyway 
the queen does not have to pay tax but she has been voluntarily paying income tax and capital gains tax since  
the queen has the power to form governments 
unlike the queen prime minister david cameron doesnt literally sit on a throne rob stothardgetty imageshbobi 
the queen previously wielded the power to dissolve parliament and call a general election but the fixedterm parliaments act put an end to that in  now a twothirds vote in the commons is required to dissolve parliament before a fiveyear fixedterm is up 
she does still play a part after an election however when she calls on the mp most able to form a government to do so 
this caused some worry ahead of this years general election it once looked as if the conservatives might not have a majority but would be the largest party and would try to form a government meanwhile it was feasible that labour could form a majority despite having fewer seats by entering into a coalition with multiple other parties 
in this situation the queen would have been stuck between a rock and a hard place every year she opens parliament with the queens speech which lays out the governments plans but to give david camerons speech would arguably be to tacitly endorse his government  while staying away would send the opposite message 
at one point the times was told by sources that she planned to stay away if cameron failed to secure enough mps but the palace later had an aboutface royal sources confirmed she would lead proceedings even if there was a risk the speech would be overthrown the following week because the tories had failed to muster enough backing from smaller parties the times subsequently reported 
she has knights 
sure they no longer ride around on horseback wooing maidens with their tales of valour but britain still retains knights like lords they are appointed by the queen  and she knights them personally 
knighthoods are typically given to figures who have made a particular contribution to british society  whether in business the arts the military or elsewhere after terry pratchett was knighted the legendary fantasy author forged himself a special sword using pieces of a meteorite 
the individuals knighted are decided by ministers the bbc reports who present her with a list of nominees each year for her approval 
she is exempt from freedom of information requests 
all information about the royal family is exempt from freedom of information requests the exemption was made after a legal battle between the guardian and the government to have letters from prince charles sent to whitehall ministers made public the socalled black spider memos were recently released but the change means the same cant happen in the future 
she can ignore or overrule ministerial advice in grave constitutional crisis 
while the overwhelming majority of the queens prerogative powers are devolved to her ministers there is one exception that allows her to wield power herself only in grave constitutional crisis the sovereign can act contrary to or without ministerial advice with no precedent in modern times its not clear what would actually constitute this but the possibility remains 
the queen holds the ability to fire the entire australian government 
as the head of state in australia the queen has certain powers over the government in  for example the queens representative in the country at the time gov gen sir john kerr fired the prime minister in response to a government shutdown 
kerr appointed a replacement who immediately passed the spending bill to fund the government max fisher wrote in the washington post three hours later kerr dismissed the rest of parliament then australia held elections to restart from scratch and they havent had another shutdown since 
in addition to the uk and australia the queen is also the head of state in antigua and barbuda the bahamas barbados belize canada grenada jamaica new zealand papua new guinea saint kitts and nevis saint lucia saint vincent and the grenadines solomon islands and tuvalu 
all the above are commonwealth realms or former british colonies the british sovereign retains the position she holds in the united kingdom that of head of state as in britain this is largely a ceremonial role from day to day 
shes the head of a religion 
queen elizabeth ii is the head of the church of england britains state religion first established after king henry viii split away from the catholic church in rome in the th century 
her formal title is defender of the faith and supreme governor of the church of england and she also has the power to appoint bishops and archbishops as with many of her other powers however this is exercised only on the advice of the prime minister who himself takes advice from a church commission 
an interesting side effect of this is that the sovereign must be a confirmed member of church of england catholics and those of other religions may not ascend to the british throne if prince charles converted to islam for example he would be unable to become king after queen elizabeth ii dies 
she gets to give away special money to the elderly 
maundy money is a special kind of silver coin the queen gives away to pensioners every year at a uk cathedral every easter in a special ceremony the number of recipients corresponds with the sovereigns age this year for example she will be  when easter rolls around so she will give maundy money away to  pensioners 
the coins are technically legal tender despite coming in unconventional pence and pence denominations but given the coins rare status they tend not to enter general circulation 
shes also immune from prosecution 
all prosecutions are carried out in the name of the sovereign and she is both immune from prosecution and cannot be compelled to give evidence in court 
in theory the sovereign is incapable of thinking or doing wrong legal scholar john kirkhope told business insider however barrister baroness helena kennedy qc told the bbc in  that nowadays that immunity is questionable 
although civil and criminal proceedings cannot be taken against the sovereign as a person under uk law the queen is careful to ensure that all her activities in her personal capacity are carried out in strict accordance with the law according to official site of the monarchy 
if the monarch did commit a grievance offence he or she would almost certainly be forced to abdicate there is at least one precedent of the courts prosecuting the sovereign in the th century king charles i was tried for treason following the english civil war he said no earthly power can justly call me who am your king in question as a delinquent the court disagreed and had him executed 
the queen has the right to be consulted to encourage and to warn her ministers 
assuming no grave constitutional crisis the queens input into the legislative process is supposed to be limited in real terms to the right to be consulted to encourage and to warn her ministers  advice delivered via meetings with the prime minister 
the queen also has certain historic rights and privileges john kirkhope a lawyer who successfully campaigned to have details of queens consent made public provided business insider with a list of some of the stranger rights the queen still holds 
hungerford has to present a red rose to the sovereign in exchange for its fishing and grazing rightsthe duke of atholl must pay by way of a rose whenever the sovereign calls this most recently happened during the reign of queen victoria so its unclear whether the rose has to be any particular colourif the sovereign passes near kidwelly castle in wales the tenant has to provide a bodyguard in full armour this is complicated slightly by the fact the castle is a ruinthe marquis of ailesbury owns savernake forest and is required to produce a blast on a hunting horn should the sovereign pass through the forest this last happened in similarly the owner of dunlambert castle in northern ireland has to produce a blast on an ancient bugleand lastly many landowners must also pay a quitrent  a kind of tax on their property paid to the monarch some are pretty unusual 
the owner of sauchlemuir castle must set out three glasses of port on new years eve for the grandmother of james iv of scotland for reference james iv served from  to the owner of fowlis must deliver  when required  a snowball in midsummerthe city of gloucester pays for its holdings of crown lands by providing an enormous eel piegreat yarmouth must provide a hundred herrings baked in  pasties to the sheriff who then sends them to the lord of the manor  who then sends them to the sovereignthe duke of marlborough has to present a small satin flag with a fleur de lys on august  the anniversary of the battle of blenheimthe duke of wellington has to present a french tricolour flag before noon on june   the anniversary of the battle of waterloo",2016-10-30

whether or not youre a basketball fan youre going to love this story about a bold new humanitarian initiative from the nba in order to help alleviate the refugee crisis in europe the league is housing syrian refugees on whichever half of the court isnt being played on during the game 
now thats making a difference way to go nba 
since the syrian civil war began in  millions of syrians have been displaced but thanks to the generosity of the nba some of them will now find a new home right around the threepoint line on the half of the court that isnt being played on at that time while players occupy one half of the court syrian refugees will have a safe and welcoming space on the other half to reassemble their lives until the ball changes possession and they are shuttled to the opposite end 
wow what a beautiful gesture from the nba with  courts across the country and  games in the  season the league is set to provide housing that periodically oscillates from one half of the court to the other for several thousand syrian refugees this is huge 
in contrast to europes notoriously overcrowded refugee camps the nbas half courts are big enough to comfortably house at least five families around the perimeter and one or two in the paint the refugees also have access to any snack vendors who happen to be milling about the crowd near whichever half of the court theyre on at the time 
of course its a new program and its not perfect there have been several incidents in which refugees have collided with players after failing to get to the other half of the court in time and last night an yearold syrian girl had to be treated for minor injuries after lebron james dunked on her during a fast break 
still according to nba commissioner adam silver the program is a huge step up from the refugee camps abroad 
the syrian refugee crisis is only getting worse meanwhile weve got this half of the court that isnt being played on just collecting dust waiting to be put to good use said silver adding that he felt the league had a moral responsibility to harbor the refugees if we can help these people by sheltering them on one side of the court until theres a change in possession and then sheltering them on the other half as soon as theres a change in possession and then sheltering them on the other half until theres a change in possession then we have an obligation to do that 
its refreshing to see a major organization like the nba reaching out to a group of people who so desperately need our help right now faith in humanity restored",2016-10-27
533,life  robot street performers that refused to break character for a fucking second and tell me if they had seen my son,"email 
in an age where information can be spread to millions of people within seconds its often difficult to separate fact from fiction that was certainly the case a few months ago when a controversial photo of president obama began to circulate online with many insisting that the image was the real unedited deal but today that picture was officially debunked the photo of obama with a speech balloon saying islam is my main thing has been proven to be doctored 
wow this is a good reminder to take everything you see on the internet with a grain of salt 
take a look at the photo in question above in it you can clearly see obama proudly declaring his unshakeable islamic faith 
at first glance the photo looks like pretty clear evidence that obama may be muslim and confirms the suspicions of his most farright critics who insist the president has been dishonest with the public about his true religious beliefs but when the image went viral on twitter one user pointed out a possible sign of doctoring 
many users agreed that the photo appeared to have been manipulated in some way and asked for an expert to weigh in a graphic designer named brendan mccann whose twitter bio says hes been in the industry for over a decade quickly answered the call 
but it was snopes that officially put the matter to rest after scouring the internet far and wide they were able to dig up the original version of the photograph taken during one of the presidents official white house photo ops and theres no speech balloon upholding the teachings of the quran anywhere in sight 
take a look at the two images side by side to see how the effect was achieved 
well there you have it it looks like whoever made this image took some of the space from above the presidents head and used it to overlay the speech balloon on top its a powerful effect but its definitely not real remember when it comes to the internet always question your sources",2016-10-26

535,debunked the photo of obama with a speech balloo  clickhole,"apple is very cruel to taunt me about driving into a pool i was already deeply embarrassed and these new iphone emojis are just salt in the wound  my car falling into the pool 
the swimming pool near my house closes after the summer so i decided to have one last splash in late september it was a little cold to go swimming but i didnt want to miss out on the fun of the pool despite the chilly weather i had a great experience at least until it was time to head to my car and drive home leaving the parking space i accidentally went backwards and drove my honda right through a chainlink fence and into the pool i cant excuse this dumb mistake but in my defense i was still soaking wet and shivering and that distracted me from driving when apple released this emoji of my car going into the pool i was mostly curious why they had singled my situation out for an update but i have to admit i kind of deserved it  me in my flooding car 
i have always been a loyal customer of apples technology products which makes this second emoji feel like a betrayal the first emoji of my car falling into the pool was perhaps deserved because i was extremely clumsy and foolish but a second emoji at my expense was completely uncalledfor worst of all this emoji has now been embraced by teens to represent bad sex and they tweet messages like my tinder date went well but emoji fml i am uncomfortable having my face seen by millions of people in this context  the lifeguard calling me a dunce 
i am furious with this emoji because it is inaccurate as well as cruel unlike apple the lifeguard was nothing but polite as he helped me crawl out of my underwater cars window and at no point did he call me a dunce the lifeguard did ask what the hell happened and i could tell he thought i was dumb but he did not say the word dunce or any other insult not even once if apple wants to taunt me with their emojis they can at least depict things as they actually occurred  the words wet idiot beneath me as i swim out of the pool 
doesnt apple know i already feel bad enough about swimming across a pool in my street clothes all the other swimmers had already evacuated the pool and were watching me with judgmental eyes as i flailed through the water in jeans and a polo tshirt my sneakers got completely soaked and still smell mildewy weeks after drying out this humiliation is only mitigated by the fact that the wetidiot emoji is now extremely popular among iphone users in china and millions of chinese people use it in text messages to represent amazing sex but still i wish apple had elected not to release any of these  me on the bicycle i must ride now that my car is ruined 
under normal circumstances i would be thrilled and honored to have apple turn my bicycle into an emoji however given the timing it seems like apple is poking fun at the fact that now this bicycle is my only mode of transportation perhaps losing a car to a swimming pool isnt a big deal to a rich company like apple but to normal folks like me a honda is a major investment and i cannot afford to replace it at this time what stings worst of all is that i find this emoji very handy and i frequently text it to people to tell them im on my way unfortunately despite apples cruel mission to shame me i find my iphone too useful to stop using",2016-10-26

it was then i remember the cabbie got out of his cab then he got back in the cab and thats all i remember 
so says your sister if i have your story right you hailed a cab in the forest and at some point the driver got out of the vehicle and thats all you remember exactly theres more to the story let me start over 
the next thing i knew he was back in the cab 
where you headed he asked me again i told him to go to my sisters house he got out of the cab again 
i believe you about the driver getting out of the car but i dont think you saw any aliens says your sister im sorry but thats just how i feel 
your sister doesnt believe that you were abducted by aliens you have failed start over 
the cabbie floored it and pretty soon we were driving through the city on the way to my sisters house which is where you live we arrived and i thanked the cabbie for his service 
when we arrived i got out of the cab the cabbie and i pointed at each other and waved goodbye in silence for three minutes and thats the end of my story 
well it certainly sounds like you took a taxi from the forest to my apartment but im sorry to say im not convinced that you saw any aliens says your sister is that really the whole story yes thats it there was more 
then i dont believe you saw any aliens 
ouch you really bungled the story about how you were abducted by aliens you are a miserable bard of the supernatural and your sister didnt believe you at all you have failed start over 
your sister settles in as you begin your alien testimony 
it began like any other night i thought it was guy fawkes night so i was in the forest setting off fireworks by myself i would light the firework run back to safety look up and 
 boom good riddance sir fawkes it was so much fun i decided to light another firework i wasnt having fun but i decided to light another firework 
i lit the firework stepped back and looked up i expected to see a sparkling skyrocket what i saw was a sparkling skyrocket just as i had expected a strange light in the sky 
yes it was a skyrocket my expectation was on the money 
i prepared to launch another firework into the sky i loaded it up sprinted back to safety and looked to the sky again this time expecting to see the gorgeous blue and purple firework known as the butchers delight and the butchers delight it was and thats when it happened 
i was right again in the clear sky above me i saw the firework called the butchers delight 
i set up the last firework drew a match and lit the fuse it was a quick fuse so the firework had already launched by the time i turned around and looked up thinking i would see the unmistakeable multicolored burst of the salute to james buchanan firework but is that what i saw looking to the skies yes it was it was not for that was when it happened 
yes my sibling the salute to james buchanan firework exploded as planned 
i applauded at the fireworks finale congratulating myself on another successful night of fireworks even as i realized that i had bungled the guy fawkes date again then i went home then i came right to you 
thank you says your sister that was a very nice story about how you set off fireworks in the woods by yourself and did you see any aliens while you were at it yes no 
well i dont believe you you only told me about fireworks i was expecting to hear more about aliens 
you have not convinced your sister that you saw aliens wait i didnt tell it right start over 
okay says your sister its too bad nothing happened with aliens 
you have not convinced her that you were abducted by aliens wait i didnt tell it right start over 
a strange light appeared in the sky i ran but the strange light followed me i couldnt escape it there was a sudden burst of futuristic light 
science enveloped me the light only got more futuristic then all of a sudden i was standing on the ufo deck 
when the light faded i noticed that i was on a spaceship 
this part of the ship was clean and triangular i noticed that the spaceship had some sort of artificial gravity i could tell immediately that the spaceship was in space 
okay i think i understand that you were on a spaceship says your sister get to the aliens though how about some aliens in the story when you were on the spaceship were there any aliens that you saw yes i dont know but my boss from my first job was there 
my boss from my first job was there and he was happy to see me my boss said that i was dreaming and i said yes that seems right my boss said that i was dreaming and i said no thats wrong but it later turned out that he was right 
hmm says your sister it sounds to me like instead of encountering aliens you had a dream about seeing your boss in space could that be right yeah thats definitely right wait i told the story wrong let me start over 
you were trying to get your sister to believe that you had seen aliens but all you managed to convince her of was that you had a dream about seeing your boss in space you failed start over 
there were aliens a crowd of them huge mighty creatures with skin like leather hollow black eyes and fearsome ivory fangs the aliens were shouting at me but i couldnt understand what they were saying jench crev amamu the aliens shouted but i could not understand 
from among the aliens a bigger alien stepped forth i immediately realized this was their mayor of the aliens as the alien was wearing a ceremonial mayoral jacket the mayor took out a device 
the mayor reached out and put the device over my eyes 
suddenly i could hear everything differently the mayor then seemed to speak to me in english 
welcome to my ufo said the mayor you are now wearing language glasses they allow you to understand anything that we say in our language but be careful it doesnt work the other way around if you want to learn how to talk like us youll need to visit the language room and earn a diploma from the language guide i told the mayor that i understood i told the mayor that i didnt understand i asked the mayor to explain who the aliens were and what their purpose was 
i dont know what youre saying but im going to assume you asked who we are and what our purpose is 
to do that i will need to tell you how the world works in the universe there are three kinds of things first there is us we are called people you can tell were people by inspecting our beautiful ivory fangs and big thick legs its obvious 
second there is god god is special secret and far away and there is only one of him and we need to find him so that we can hold hands forever we dont know where god is but we are looking for him 
last there is rocks rocks is everything else planets are rocks spaceships are rocks since you are not a person you are probably also a rockunless of course you are god but thats very unlikely and illegal i asked the mayor how to find out if i am a rock or if i am god 
i still cant understand you but heres the deal im going to retreat to the observation deck and look at the majesty of space for a while go to the language room learn our language then come find me and well see if we can find a use for you the mayor left and i was alone with the crowd of aliens 
in the spaceships deck the crowd of aliens was talking excitedly about god and about the kinds of dances they would do together when they found him at last i left the deck area and went south into the hallway 
in the language room a man was standing on a small circular stage 
above him hung a giant banner that read language tutorial for english speakers he began the tutorial 
welcome to this free alienlanguage tutorial for english speakers said the man if you are viewing this in hologram form it means our captors have determined i am no longer necessary and that they have mercifully killed me and freed me from my didactic prison right on i waved my hand through him to confirm that he was a hologram i continued watching the presentation 
he was not a hologram 
ha not yet i wish he said please sit down and lets get this presentation over with i sat back down and kept watching the presentation 
lets begin with the most basic grammatical element of the language the word crev the man began 
he gestured in the air beside him where the word crev appeared in red light 
crev is a verb that roughly translates as to be about to point at something if you want to communicate effectively with the aliens its an extremely important word to know crev i managed to say creb i blurted stupidly 
for example to announce that i am ready to point at something i would begin with the word amamu which means me then i would say crev then i would say what i am pointing at 
like this amamu crev meryl streep i looked where the man was pointing i knew then that the man was pointing at meryl streep 
hello said meryl streep i am definitely a hologram amamu crev meryl streep i said as i pointed at the meryl streep hologram 
very good the next word were going to learn is important but be aware that it is very politically charged i am of course talking about the controversial word crevv and you must be very careful with it its a slur that means bad alien and is extremely insulting to use in any situation but language tutorials crevv i said i nodded solemnly i asked the teacher for an example of the bad word in context 
here is an example of crevv used in english context oh god the aliens are killing me why did i say crevv why didnt someone teach me not to say crevv i shouldnt have said crevv i said okay i said nothing 
crevv i said 
no sooner had the word left my lips than a fearsome ivory fang had pierced my vulnerable stomach and sent everything inside me all over the place i was dead 
you wrap your story about the aliens 
ah soyou died your sister asks yeah wait i didnt tell the story right let me start over 
hmmm idoubt it says your sister 
you told a story about how you got abducted by aliens and died but your sister doesnt seem convinced 
no one believed you you failed wait i didnt tell the story right start over 
at this point youre almost conversant in the language you just have a couple more words to get through i am now teaching you the word jench it means god i said jench 
finally the word bride is the equivalent of the english word um when you say the word bride it means that you have forgotten how to speak and you are trying to remember i said bride 
this concludes this first and only module of alien language for english beginners thank you for learning with me get out there start speaking the language and remember if im not already dead please find someone who will kill me 
with that the teacher handed me a diploma with some inscrutable symbols on it and ushered me out of the language room i left the language room and went back out to the ship hallway i went east 
i was in the ship corridor to the south of the first room i went north",2016-10-27

 have a really awesome theme the best halloween parties are the ones that have a great theme and stick to it unless thats just not a thing your friends would be into is it ghosts and ghouls or zombie apocalypse or maybe your party is the fourth one of the night for your friends and they dont want to spend money on multiple costumes in that case maybe a theme isnt the way to go just ask around and youll be good to go 
 fire up some spooky music nothing sets the mood like some classic monster mash however its entirely possible that your attendees would actually favor a playlist of pop hits to just generally hang out to no worries then just do whats best for you and everyone thats planning on coming and youll surely still have a great time right 
 if youre not into decorations you can probably just skip this one jackolanterns skeletons and spiderwebs will all add to the experience of a scary party if thats a thing your partygoers would prefer you know your social group better than we do so before you blindly take these suggestions maybe you should simply think about how this will enhance or diminish the experience for your friends specifically its really not even that hard and would probably be the best tip we could give anyway 
 make sure to have a mix of really fun party games look were really generalizing here is this suggestion for everyone no only you know if your friends will be excited to bob for apples or whatever we cant make individual lists for every goddamn reader so surprise youre going to have to do a little work too and decide if this one is right for your gathering

 dont have the party if your friends dont like to party on halloween we shouldnt have to say this but you dont have to throw a party at all why did you even read this list if you know your crew hates halloween what the hell is wrong with you please close this tab power down your computer and throw it in the ocean thanks",2016-10-27

its time to get excited because marvel comics just announced a new superhero that advances diversity in comics in a major way the series is called luminary  and it tells the story of a mildmannered caucasian man named percy pendleton who gains incredible superhuman powers and constantly expresses his regret that he was blessed with those abilities instead of a latina woman who could be a role model for young hispanic girls in addition to merely fighting crime 
yes marvel deserves major kudos for this massive step toward inclusive representation in comics 
while working as a nuclear physicist at stark industries percy is caught in a particleaccelerator explosion a surge of neutrinos floods his nervous system and transforms him into the incredible luminary a hero whose amazing powers of flight super strength and energy manipulation make him concerned that as a white man he does nothing to reflect the face of a changing america which is increasingly hispanic and female 
wow what a longoverdue breath of fresh air to see a bigname publisher like marvel feature a white male superhero who thinks its a shame he isnt latina

orangutans orangutans are among a special group of animals with mating rituals based around the lunar cycle meaning that whenever a full moon is in the sky male orangutans will climb the tallest tree and try to have sex with the moon only settling for a female orangutan once they grow tired of stretching their penises outward so they might touch the moon with it 
armadillos in the armadillos song the male armadillos penis makes an annoying highpitched whirring sound until a female armadillo is so annoyed by it that she silences it by having sex with him 
alligators during mating season male alligators stand upright and walk around on their hind legs and place their arms on their hips and sometimes even ride bikes until a female alligator gets horny from watching them 
beavers the male beaver and female beaver each recite a fun fact about beavers taking a step closer to one another as they do so at some point they get so close that theyre actually mating 
elephants before having sex the female elephant will coat her male partner in sticky boiling hot pepsi that only comes out of her trunk when shes in the mood 
iguanas when it is time for iguanas to mate the male iguana climbs on top of a female fox and the female iguana climbs on top of a male fox the two iguanas ride their foxes straight at each other at full speed and when the foxes collide with each other the iguanas are flung forward and collide in midair as they fly through the air the male iguana impregnates the female iguana who sprays eggs in all directions as she hurtles haphazardly toward the sky when the mating ritual is complete both iguanas hit the ground and die

some people just want more and more and more 
the endless selfishness on display here is just sickening apparently having dozens of movie theaters and a whole zoo to enjoy isnt enough for the pleasure gluttons of chicago they need a big honking world series victory too 
well give you a minute to try to wrap your head around the sheer unbridled avarice of these people all you have to do is google movie theaters chicago and youll be flooded with the names and addresses of cinemas all over the city playing both mainstream blockbusters and art house gems which the people of chicago can go to whenever they want and when they arent in the mood for a movie these spoiled brats can go see exotic creatures from all over the world at the lincoln park zoo but apparently thats not enough to satisfy these unhinged hedonists no they need a gigantic parade for the chicago cubs cutting right through the middle of their city they need fountains of champagne and a picture of anthony rizzo celebrating on the front page of every major newspaper in the country 
hey chicago maybe if the cubs win the world series someone will make a movie about it and you can go watch it in whichever one of the goddamn dozens of fucking movie theaters in your charmed little city is closest to your house and then when the movie about your world champion baseball team is over you can go talk about it while you look at the majestic lowland gorillas that live at your fully functioning goddamn zoo if you arent sickened by what you see in the mirror chicago its because greed has warped your minds 
some people are just never content no matter how many blessings life serves to them on a silver platter apparently the people in chicago will not be satisfied unless their brains are gushing dopamine in all directions at all times they have so many movie theaters they have a zoo and yet they wont be happy until the fucking president of the united states is personally congratulating them for having the best baseball team in the world where do they get the gall to desire a world series victory amid their cornucopia of movie theaters and their zoo its disgusting nothing is ever enough for chicago

since donald trump entered the election over a year ago he has singlehandedly destroyed the gop leaving both the house and the senate in utter disarray but although many political strategists believe permanent damage has been done conservatives shouldnt lose hope yet because speaker of the house paul ryan has just emerged fully nude from an ayahuasca tent with visions of a new republican party 
a fresh gop platform requires fresh leadership and when speaker ryan journeyed to south america last week to embark on an immersive psychedelic vision quest of political rebirth he just proved hes the only one for the job 
after traveling to peru and entering a makeshift tent with nothing but a towel  mg of dmt and a bucket to vomit in paul ryan rwis spent the last  hours lying nude on the jungle floor enduring bursts of vivid consciousness in which he watched the secrets of a unified more moderate gop unfold before his very eyes 
while under the influence of the powerful psychedelic ancient spiritual guides appeared before the congressman instructed him to remove his clothes and held him down as lifelike projections of republican leaders twisted and contorted around him until the perfect cabinet had revealed itself amid infinite realities in which tax cuts and fiscal budgets exploded into cacophonous symphonies all to create a republican party that mobilizes key voter constituencies 
check out these tweets he posted just a few moments after emerging nude from his tent in the amazon rain forest 
whoa democrats have been pretty confident this past year but if paul ryans visions of the republican party are right they better watch out 
say what you want about paul ryan but hes a man who refuses to give up on the one hand is it possible that the speakers grand ayahuasca visions of a new republican party are just a temporary fix sure but on the other hand if he plays his cards right his proposals could have an even larger impact than they did during the thousands of years he lived while trapped inside his own mind

meditation is some pretty awesome stuff and the practice is finding its way into more and more lives every day now a program at cedar creek middle school in portland me is proving that meditation can have a major impact by meditating just  minutes a day nearly all of the kids in the program have seen lower stress levels and higher test scores and three of them have gone absolutely insane 
what a remarkable result 
the program called mindful kids encourages students to sit silently in a darkened classroom for  minutes a day and listen to white noise six weeks in the effects were already striking most of the students had noticeably improved behavior and were more engaged in their schoolwork and three of them had pulled out all of their hair and created their own language that they speak through their nostrils 
its astounding said colin creedman the teacher who started the program we expected the meditation to cause some improvement but we didnt plan on it having such a big impact c students became a students there have been no fights three of them started worshipping a bunsen burner as their god and theyre much more focused in class anyone whos skeptical of the effectiveness of meditation really needs to meet these kids 
the students in the program have noticed some big differences too i feel more calm said yearold melissa hogseth not just during the meditation but throughout the day i think its great for kids to meditate 
tenyearold jason woodward says he also has benefited from meditating my blood has become pure mercury i can absorb shadows now meditation has helped me focus my energy into a beam that can cut glass and soon flesh and bone 
unbelievable the brain is an amazing thing and these kids prove that meditation can unlock its full potential and sometimes make it go batshit insane way to go cedar creek middle school",2016-11-02

 they know that sacrifice isnt just a word but a set of meanings associated with that particular word 
 they ate two raw eggs every morning two raw eggs in the afternoon and two raw eggs after sundown because thats just what you did 
 they were  feet tall with long terrible teeth and arms thick as a clippers mast and their awful strength was matched only by their appetites 
 they know that this is the best way to tie a tie 
 they were married by age  had a house by  sucked the tongue out of a jackals mouth by  had their arms and legs ripped off on the radio by  and did it all over again by  
 some of them were named leland which is wild 
 they could get under the hood of any car and tell you exactly how theyd fuck it 
 the previous holder of that title was the generation that came up with the idea for pets so you gotta think this ones pretty great 
 they never threw anything out if they could tuck it under one of their folds 
 you could kill  or even  of them and you still wouldnt have killed all of them 
 when it really really mattered they put aside differences of race creed sex and nationality to do world war ii 
 they drove the hideous tasmanian tiger extinct 
 theyre definitely the last generation to ever witness this in person 
 many of them live underground pretty impressive 
 their ranks include frank sinatra john travoltas dad and dagwood from blondie  
 they never left a man behind thats why we have bruce 
 they fought for civil rights but also against civil rights but they won the fight but they really tried pretty hard to shut that fight down so maybe that ones kind of a wash 
 they probably invented tarp the outdoor silk 
 they learned the kind of dignity and poise that makes this happen when they enter a room

sit next to elton john on a flight and youll see a man living in the lap of luxury as he immediately tapes this photo of a shark darting through the ocean over his window to stare at throughout the trip the platinumselling artist has been known to pull his window shade down to make the shark disappear and then quickly retract it to mark the animals triumphant return he will often repeat this act dozens of times per flight  a great white shark leaping into the air 
when youre an international pop sensation worth an estimated  million people go the extra mile to make you happy flight crews are instructed to place this photo of a breaching great white in elton johns seatback pocket before he even boards the plane the fivetime grammy winner loves to pull the image out at his leisure to stare at while flying sometimes holding it a mere to inches away from his face while he fixates upon the sharks beady eyes  a shark on the prowl 
rumor has it elton john first acquired this shark photo in  just before flying to london to perform candle in the wind at princess dianas funeral its been a staple of his travel routine ever since those who have flown with the music legend say that sir elton turns on every single overhead light in his row to study this picture with a magnifying glass  two hammerhead sharks 
how does the man behind tiny dancer and rocket man handle turbulence as his plane traverses the atlantic once that fasten seat belts sign lights up this picture of two hammerhead sharks comes out elton john holds the photo in a tight vice grip and stares straight at it until the turbulence passes often without blinking for minutes at a time  the poster for jaws 
sir elton john absolutely adores the poster for steven spielbergs jaws and hopes to one day see the film in the meantime the british icon makes do by slowly unfolding his byinch copy of the poster whenever hes on a long flight gently tracing the sharks teeth with his finger as he stares lovingly into its gaping mouth  pilots choice 
as much as elton relishes in the calming regularity of his shark picture rotation he also loves the excitement of gazing upon a totally unexpected shark when flying from london to a distant corner of europe thats why all pilots who fly sir elton print out a shark picture of their choice from their home computers before going to the airport and hand it to the visibly excited musician prior to takeoff so yeahits good to be elton",2016-11-02

for friends and family who loved him dearly the death of robert harkin in early august was sudden and unexpected but despite their sadness they can take comfort in knowing that his legacy will live on his sister karen has taken over his facebook page and honors her brother by continuing to share islamophobic rhetoric in his memory 
absolutely beautiful 
they rarely chose to talk about politics while he was alive but karen has been able to reconnect with her brother since his death by discovering his fear and hatred of islam its been a steep learning curve but in time shes been able to understand so much about what he cared about most and she now feels closer to him than ever the threat syrian refugees pose to our freedom the politicians who willingly turn a blind eye to the rising threat of islamic terrorismall of the bigoted beliefs that made robert who he was 
since picking up the mantle of his facebook account karen has committed to maintaining the xenophobia that exemplified her brothers life when time magazine ran a story about a muslim woman who felt unsafe in america karen understood right away that robert would want to share the article with the comment maybe shed feel more safe if she moved to saudia arabia where she can practice sharia law with the rest of them sometimes a sister just knows 
for those who were close to robert seeing a backwards misinformed post decrying the spread of radical islam is like being with him again his page is a place where those who knew him can come share a memory and talk about the spread of sharia lawexactly what robert would have wanted whenever she posts about the inherent violence in the muslim faith karen takes comfort in knowing that with every like and share her brother remains a vibrant part of peoples lives 
in the wake of roberts death i think everyone was just looking for a place to see hateful rhetoric says karen who remembers her brother by spending two to three hours per day scouring the internet for signs of a larger islamic conspiracy i miss him every day but as long as i continue to invite his facebook friends to like a group whose mission is to block the construction of mosques in america its like hes still here 
wow if only everyone had such a devoted sister wherever he is robert must be resting easy knowing his sister is there to share his hateful paranoid beliefs with the world",2016-11-02

i honestly never thought id see the cubs bring home the trophy but everyone here is still too swept up with grief over lady di to really enjoy themselves right now said cubbies superfan raymon lindley who was among the thousands of fans who gathered outside wrigley field following last nights edgeofyourseat game to light candles in memory of the late princess of wales it would be macabre to celebrate the win in light of what happened to princess diana on that fateful august night in  
theo epstein the cursebreaking president of baseball operations for the cubs has shipped the world series trophy overseas to britain where it is to be laid on the grave of the peoples princess while the people of chicago are undoubtedly proud of their cubs no parade has been planned as the general feeling of the city is that it would be too gratuitous at this time 
i just called my yearold grandfather who waited his whole life to see the cubs win the world series said longtime seasonticket holder karen hunter we spent the entire call crying about princess diana together she was so young 
i would give a thousand cubs world series wins if lady di could be alive for one more day hunter added 
history has been made and the cubs finally have their muchsoughtafter championship but fans clearly still have a long way to go before theyre comfortable celebrating the historic achievement aside from the occasional outburst of candle in the wind by groups of bereft fans wrigleyville will remain a quiet and mournful place until the cubs faithful are ready to party with their victorious hometown heroes and its anyones guess as to when that will be",2016-11-02

it should come as no surprise that the  billion bottledwater industry is pretty much the polar opposite of environmental sustainability fortunately one of the biggest producers of bottled water is taking some real action to go green poland spring is fighting the accumulation of plastic waste with a new campaign that highlights how terrible their bottled water tastes 
now here is a company that gets it 
we just want to get the word out that our crystalclear water tastes truly awful said janet connor senior vp of marketing for poland spring every year  billion plastic water bottles are thrown out in order to minimize the impact we have on the environment we wanted to remind people that drinking our fresh spring water is an unpleasant ordeal from the first sip to the last given the option it would be a better idea to drink hot wolf piss 
as part of the campaign poland spring is marshaling their full resources behind the effort including print and billboard placements that advertise their water as a miserable experience for your mouth to support these efforts social campaigns using the hashtag mypolandspringtasteslike will encourage users to share the first time they tried the companys bottled water and to pull no punches when it comes to describing the excruciating flavor 
poland spring has even updated its website to reflect their new focus 
wow what a huge win for the environment its nice to see that the folks at poland spring are willing to describe their product as satans vomit if it means making this planet a better place way to go",2016-11-02

 phrase your request carefully its absolutely imperative that when you ask the man who currently has his hand on your knee for a raise you are respectful and conscious nail down every word in your request beforehand so that when the time comes the man with his hand on your knee is inspired but not threatened 
 anticipate your talking points ask yourself is your employer dataconscious is your parent company in a good financial position to give out raises right now are five sweaty fingers simply resting on your knee or are they moving around toying playfully with the fabric on your pants as youre sitting across from the man controlling those fingers make sure youre constantly asking yourself these types of questions because if you do youre guaranteed to step up your negotiation skills tenfold 
 assume a stance that is confident but also gently pushes his hand off your knee whether youre crossing your legs to subtly shake his hand off your knee or swiveling your chair to guide his palm onto the armrest of your chair try to use your body to signal confidence rather than looking fidgety after all visual cues are just as important as verbal ones so when you sit down in his office and notice the hand on your leg or rubbing your upper arm look like the valuable employee you truly know you are 
 make sure to ask for an exact salary before the mans fingers start moving up your leg it might seem daunting at first to directly ask for money but if you dont come with an exact number in mind the man with his hand on your knee will end up confused with little direction information about how much of a bump to give you calculate an appropriate new salary so you can bargain but when you do avoid mentioning the salaries of any other coworkers whose legs he has also touched because this is about you not them 
 dont mention the hand a real negotiator stays on target and doesnt let daytoday work conversations creep into business mentioning or even looking at the hand is a surefire way to upset the man with his hand on your knee and bring the meeting to a close without getting a raise keep your message laserfocused 
 be prepared for a no look you might not get a raise this time but dont worry its not personal thats just business and sometimes you have to ask once twice or even three more times before the man with his hand on your knee finally gives you a raise and if he doesnt who knows might be time for a new job",2016-11-04

567,life career goals ftw  tips for asking the man whose hand is currently on your knee for a raise,email yoda is a sick elderly reptile who lives alone at a motel in a swamp hes an absolute mess and hes incapable of looking after himself do you think you have what it takes to be his livein caretaker  before we get started you need to understand that this is not a glamorous job yoda is miserable to be around he needs constant supervision and his hygiene is appalling caring for him is an aroundtheclock gig and it requires an extraordinary level of patience and compassion youre going to have to put up with a lot of bullshit thats okay im confident i can handle whatever challenges the job throws my way wow that sounds pretty difficult i suppose id just have to try my best and hope i do a good job honestly i dont really have any experience with anything like this i already know that i would do a terrible job  one of the most important aspects of the job is tending to yodas skincare needs his skin is dry flaky and covered in sores and it needs to be rubbed down several times a day with a special prescription lotion unfortunately yoda hates being touched and he wont let you put the lotion on without a fight sometimes hell spray you with his stink gland or try to bite you other times hell scurry underneath the couch and try to dig a hole in the floor to hide in frantically scratching at the carpet until his hooves are bloody and raw with this in mind how would you go about getting him to cooperate with you for his skin treatments using simple terms he can understand id explain to him why the skin treatments are necessary and id work with him to figure out what exactly he doesnt enjoy about them and then use that information to tailor the process for him so that its as painless and comfortable as possible i would trap him underneath a laundry basket until he burns off all his combative energy then once hes tuckered out i would pin him to the floor with my knee and apply the lotion to his skin as quickly as possible before he gets a second wind id spread a thin layer of the lotion around the inside of a garbage bag then id roll a tennis ball past yoda to create a distraction and while his attention is diverted i would run over and stuff him inside the garbage bag id shake him up and down inside the bag until his body was covered in lotion and then i would dump him out on a mat of paper towels to clean off any excess lotion i would really rather not touch his gross skin so id probably just leave the lotion out on the counter for him  yoda always makes a huge fuss about eating his fruits and vegetables and if he had his way he would live entirely off of slim jims how would you ensure that hes eating a healthy nutritious diet and not just slim jims i would make him healthy vegetarian slim jims out of ground mushrooms spices lentils and other wholesome ingredientshe wouldnt be able to tell the difference i would dip all of his slim jims in nail polish remover to make them taste horrible leaving him no choice but to eat the vegetables if he doesnt want to go hungry i would tell him that his nemesis count dooku is coming to spay him and the only way for him to get strong enough to fight back is if he fills himself up on powerful vitamins and minerals like the ones found in fruits and vegetables i would mash the fruits and vegetables into a paste and force the paste down his throat with my fingers  yoda spends hours each morning tending to a patch of weeds out back that he refers to as his crops its pretty harmlesshe mostly just sprays the hose and drags a rake around a bitbut if you dont keep an eye on him hell sneak away and try to find the chosen one thats what he calls the trasheating swamp pelican that lives in the pond behind the house its unclear why he thinks this pelican is so special but hes already given it his lightsaber and all of his money in an effort to help it defeat the dark side this is all nonsense of course and its important to make sure yoda doesnt give any more of his valuables to this bird what measures would you take to keep yoda away from the chosen one i would tether him to the house with a length of rope thats long enough for him to freely tend to his crops but too short for him to wander off to places he shouldnt be i would dress yoda in a vest covered in flashing lights and bells which would scare the pelican away should it ever try to approach shock collar i would shoot the pelican with a gun and then make yoda eat its disgusting meat so that he realizes that the bird isnt special  theres nothing in the world that yoda enjoys more than watching pornography however doing so gets him extremely riled up and his doctor has warned that his heart is no longer strong enough to handle excitement like this nonetheless yoda will still try to watch porn any chance he gets and the only way to curb this habit is to reprimand him when he does how would you reprimand yoda for watching porn i would revoke his tv and computer privileges for the rest of the day and have him use his time to do something constructive instead i would put an oven mitt over his head and ducttape it in place so hed be physically incapable of looking at pornor anything else for that matter i would leave the oven mitt over his head for an entire day i would strip off all his clothes and parade him around town so that he could see how it feels to have strangers stare at him when hes naked i would charge people  to take pictures with naked yoda and i would spend all the money on something he hates i would put him in the oven and pretend like i was going to cremate him and i would only take him out if he promised to never look at porn again  one thing to be aware of is that yoda is very afraid of airplanes if he hears a commercial jet flying overhead hell freak out and try to use the force to make it crash granted hes probably not strong enough anymore to actually cause any harm but just be aware that thats a thing he might do got it ill make sure he doesnt try to down any airplanes if yoda wants to make an airplane crash who am i to stop him  yoda has no family or friends but he does have a catfish named obiwan that he keeps in a cigar box next to his bed he talks quietly to the catfish for several hours each night but what he doesnt realize is that the catfish is dead yodas doctor is concerned that hes formed an unhealthy attachment to the catfish and he has strongly suggested taking the catfish away from him before he becomes any more emotionally invested in it how would you go about taking yodas catfish away from him while also minimizing the emotional devastation that will result from losing his treasured companion i would get yoda a fishbowl and his very own pet goldfish once he has a real live fish to take care of i trust hell begin losing interest in obiwan and i will then gradually start weaning the dead fish out of his life while yoda is sleeping i would secretly put a small speaker inside of obiwans belly and wirelessly connect it to a microphone that i could use to make the dead catfish talk then the following day when yoda is having his alone time with obiwan i would have the catfish say yoda if you truly care about me please flush me down the toilet so i can go live with my family in the sewer hopefully he would feel comfortable parting with his companion if he thought it was what the dead catfish wanted i would tell yoda that count dooku is coming to make obiwan into a delicious po boy sandwich and the only way for him to thwart his nemesis is to run outside and toss obiwan into the swamp pond so he can swim away to safety i would throw obiwan in the trash and then lock yoda in a cupboard until he stops crying get results results for do you have what it takes to be yodas livein caretaker you have what it takes to be yodas livein caretaker wow sounds like this is the perfect gig for you looking after yoda is a very demanding

whether they made the vile unforgivable mistake of having a bad lawyer calling an unreliable witness or openly admitting to their crime to an undecided jury americas youth must understand that being convicted of rape should never ever happen going to court for sexual assault is one thing but being declared guilty is quite another and as responsible parents we need to do everything in our power to ensure that no child crosses that line no questions asked 
bottom line we need to do a better job at showing our sons that there is no worse mistake a young man can make than being declared guilty of rape not now not ever 
i dont care who you areif you have a son you need to teach him that being convicted of rape even just one time is unforgivable the truth is the moment your boy loses a rape trial is the moment that lives are ruined and theres absolutely no taking that back 
as a father of a young man myself i would not be able to live with myself if he someday went to jail just because of something as easily preventable as a sexual assault conviction when i look into my yearold callums eyes the last thing i want to think about is my little guy becoming the type of man who cant somehow weasel his way out of a highprofile court case in front of all his friends family and the public at large 
bottom line we need to do a better job at showing our sons that there is no worse mistake a young man can make than being declared guilty of rape not now not ever because if we want this generation of boys to grow into men that we truly take pride in we have to start teaching them that any young man who gets punished for rape brings shame not only to himself but also to his gender and this country as a whole 
so please dont wait please talk to your son today about his responsibility to never be convicted of rape and to speak up if he ever sees someone else in danger of being convicted of rape our future depends on it",2016-11-04

the president has to be kicking himself over this one 
as his term in office comes to a close it seems as if barack obama may have missed out on a pretty spectacular opportunity earlier today the president was told that he had been allowed to sleep in the white house this whole time after he spent nearly two full terms living in a hotel by reagan national airport 
sorry mr president but its true you really blew your chance on this one 
having booked an extended stay at the airport hilton upon his inauguration back in  barack and his family have resided in an atriumview room with two double beds and complimentary wifi for the past eight years but earlier this week when a senior advisor asked the president why he had chosen to live by the airport instead of the white house you could tell that obama hadnt realized the choice was his to make until that very moment 
yes obamas accomplished a lot over the years but hes got to be wondering how much more progress he might have made living at  pennsylvania avenue he would have had a lot more time to work on signature policies like the affordable care act if he hadnt wasted so much of his mornings commuting from the airport to the oval office on the dc metro theres no doubt the countless hilton rewards points obama has accrued is a nice perk but that doesnt soften the blow of leaving the neoclassic mansion built exclusively to house the commander in chief and his family empty for two full terms 
this is something obama is going to regret for a long time to come 
nobody ever explicitly told me that i could live there until now said a clearly disappointed obama as he waited patiently for a set of fresh towels while sasha and malia love being on the same floor as the pool here i now wish we had stayed at the lavish squarefoot private residence in the white house for the past eight years one time in  i slept underneath my desk after a late night and i was worried someone was going to find me there in the morning and yell at me now im being told we apparently have a personal chef and dozens of butlers this sucks

well this isnt good 
most people think of costco as the place that sells bulk quantities of pretty much everything but the warehouse superstore is now making headlines for a very different reason and it could serve to tarnish their brand the blue angels accidentally flew into the costco in augusta ga and are currently stuck flying around inside the discount retailer 
worst of all it doesnt seem like costco has any idea how to get the airplane stunt squadron to leave 
the blue angels were performing at a routine air show in augusta ga earlier today when they veered too close to the costco and zipped through the automatic doors as they slid open for a customer before costco employees could react the diamond formation of five fa hornets had entered the store and began performing deathdefying aerial feats right over the shelves of bulk cereals and jumbosize ketchups 
customers are trying to ignore the roaring jets overhead but its hard to concentrate on your shopping list when sonic booms keep knocking over pallets of kirklandbrand dog food its usually a welcome treat to see the blue angels conduct synchronized barrel rolls but inside costco the elite pilots are proving to be a serious nuisance 
so far all attempts to evict the blue angels have proved unsuccessful at first costco staff just propped the front door open with a bucket assuming the blue angels would find their way back out eventually after an hour when choreographed smoke trails continued to plague the store the manager grabbed a lacrosse stick from a sporting goods display and tried to shoo the planes toward the exit unfortunately that only caused the blue angels to accelerate to  mph and perform several looptheloops in the freezer aisle where the pilots hit a truly exhilarating  gs 
your heart just has to break for this poor manager 
with the store set to close in only a few hours costco better think up a solution fast or blue angels will be locked in overnight if that happens then tomorrows customers will be aggravated by more of the same worldclass aeronautic showmanship what an absolute hassle",2016-11-07

two years ago john fitzpatrick got the most devastating phone call of his life when he learned that his brother robert had died of a heart attack in his sleep john instantly thought of roberts yearold daughter sophie who was just starting to forge her path in life thats when this amazing uncle decided to step up in a seriously inspiring way with robert no longer there for her john took it upon himself to discourage his nieces art career 
okay is someone cutting onions in here because were getting just a little bit teary 
ever since his brothers passing john has made it a point to call his niece every single sunday evening to remind sophie just how much her father loved her how proud hed be if he could see her now and how unstable a career in the arts can be compared to more traditional ninetofive employment sophies true passion in life has always been drawing and painting but thanks to her selfless uncles constant reminders that almost nobody actually ends up working their dream job shes now just two years away from getting her ba in marketing 
i want sophie to know that she can always depend on me john explained gazing tearfully at an old photograph of robert holding his baby girl but she cannot depend on freelance income especially in a field as oversaturated and undervalued as the arts shes way too smart for that 
john has never faltered in his commitment to making sure his niece understands just how unrealistic it is to earn a living as an artist last summer when sophie landed an internship at a brooklyn art gallery john spent countless hours reminding her that new york is expensive dangerous and very far away from ohio before ultimately finding her a job doing administrative work for his friend instead and when sophie briefly considered getting a double major in studio art her uncle pulled out all the stops even going so far as to gain control of her late fathers finances so that he could temporarily withhold the semesters tuition check until she changed her mind 
incredible is there an uncle of the year award because this guy definitely just won it 
while nobody can ever take the place of sophies father it is seriously heartwarming to see john step up to the plate like this sophie is so lucky to have an uncle she can always turn to for love guidance and stacks of brochures for mba programs handed to her at every family holiday heres to you john",2016-11-07

in an election season full of anger and divisiveness its easy to lose sight of just how important and meaningful our democratic process is thankfully as millions have cast their ballots today theres been no shortage of heartwarming stories involving americans exercising their right to vote one of those stories centers around lifelong mississippi resident helen karnes who although not quite old enough to have been born before women won the right to vote is still pretty goddam old 
wow what a special woman 
while karnes cant claim that she was alive during a time when women were still politically disenfranchised it just takes one look at her to tell that shes fucking old no she might not have the inspiring thematically satisfying story of a yearold but you get the sense that shes definitely lived through some shit she was certainly around in wwii times and she mightve even been there for the depression too who knows this is no spring chicken were talking about here 
though admittedly karnes story would be a bit cooler if shed been alive before  you still have to applaud her for being old on this historic election day also her mom and her aunts were definitely alive before womens suffrage so you know shes probably got some good secondhand stories that she heard from them maybe one of them was even an important figure in the womens rights movement or something statistically speaking thats probably not the case but you never know 
its unclear if karnes voted today for americas first female presidential nominee or if she even voted at all but what matters is that shes brittle stoopedover and ancient there are probably lots of dusty ol bats out there who are older than karnes and who have more of a substantial foothold in us womens history but this lady is still more or less a living skeleton and thats something that should make us all proud to be americans",2016-11-07

this is seriously alarming news 
in what appears to be a concerted effort to prevent americans from casting their ballots on time dozens of laser tag locations are keeping normal business hours on election day inviting one and all to enjoy nonstop laser tag action with all the coolest terrain and equipment 
if true this could represent voter suppression on an unprecedented scarcely conceivable scale its appalling to see laser tag placessome of them located within blocks of polling stations in swing statesdeploying everything from signs to roadside billboards to social media posts in an attempt to stop americans from exercising their civic duty just take a look at this truly disgusting tweet

some of these laser tag facilities are continuing to operate roller rinks hole mini golf courses and gokart tracks in a shameless ploy to lure voters as far as possible from the booths said holst its an utterly transparent tactic and the saddest thing is just how effective it can be laser tag arenas represent a grave immediate threat to the democratic process

in a campaign season as contentious as this one you really have to stop and appreciate moments like this 
though sarah and colleen come from opposite ends of the political spectrum you wouldnt know it when looking into the stall at their polling station in cranford nj where they both lowered their heads into the same trash can and took turns holding each others hair back as they retched over the psychological toll this long strenuous elections taken on them no arguing no fingerpointing no namecalling just dual streams of stressinduced upchuck crescendoing in a duet of dryheaving the sight of two people who have been bombarded for months with messages that the other candidate will completely ruin the country as they know it patting one another on the back and encouraging each other to get it all out is all too welcome in an otherwise toxic and polarizing campaign season 
need more proof that its possible for trump and clinton supporters to overcome their shared animosity during this historical moment of anxiety colleen even offered sarah an altoid once theyd both stopped throwing up and cleaned the barf from their shirts further sarah graciously let colleen borrow her eyeliner which had been smudged due to the tears summoned by a panic attack she experienced while in line to vote after checking in to make sure the other was feeling all right one last time each went their separate ways having found rare common ground with their political opposites in the form of sickening anxiety stoked by the intense fear politics and extremist partisan rhetoric deployed in the  election 
yup the spirit of abraham lincoln is alive knitting a torn nation back together

amazing now that is how you rally on election day 
like so many americans candice spent her morning lying in her bed kicking herself for not having voted early but as soon as it seemed like shed go back to sleep her fallopian tubes shot out of her abdomen curled themselves around the side of her bed and threw her to the floor after dragging her body to her living room her helpful ovaries crawled up to the doorknob and jostled the front door open what started out as a lazy morning ended with her ovaries anchoring themselves to the floor and pulling the rest of her body to a polling place at nearby jefferson public school where she dutifully filled out her ballot for president of the united states 
if thats not getting out the vote we dont know what is its definitely easy to come up with a million excuses to avoid the polls but once candices ovaries had shot out of her body they werent going to retract back inside until she had done her civic duty 
while it might have been a bit of an inconvenience to spend the morning voting no matter how much she tried to resist candices ovaries kept pulling and clawing at the floor dragging her flailing body farther and farther until she arrived at a voting booth to cast her vote sure she would rather have been sleeping or at work but three miles and several forceful tugs later she was inside a voting booth and back on her feet casting her ballot and exercising her fundamental american right

with millions of americans tuning in to watch the results of this historic election cnn has been forced to press on even as they try to free john king from the computerized map a noticeably emotional wolf blitzer mouthed the words im sorry to his imprisoned colleague before tapping the board to call up a gender breakdown of likely oregon voters the bar graph of which animated right into john kings spine launching nearly all the way to the midatlantic states if cnn producers thought that they had stabilized the situation by urging king to take refuge in the bottom corner of the screen it did not take long for them to realize how wrong they were when connecticut was called for hillary clinton the trapped john king was also turned entirely blue and let loose a horrible scream as if he were being burned alive this level of panic was matched moments later when king tried to fend off a ravenous piece of malware with just his loafer only for the shoe to shatter into pixels that the code devoured 
yikes cnn will be wondering for a while how this all went so wrong and on their biggest night too

well donald trump certainly has cause for celebration today 
despite having a multibilliondollar net worth an international real estate company and a primetime television show donald trumps ambitions were still set higher the one trophy hed spent his entire life trying to claim for his mantle of accomplishments had always evaded himuntil today by winning the  presidential election donald trump is finally able to kick the nations most powerful black family out of their house 
one can only imagine the immense joy donalds wife and children feel for him today 
trump has been preparing for this moment ever since the trump organization first started buying buildings throughout new york city and raising rent for africanamericans until he could toss them out for no longer being able to afford it now after decades of practice and determination the presidentelect will see his magnum opus arrive in the form of booting the incredibly influential and powerful obama family out of the home theyve lived in for the past eight years 
ejecting black people from their residences has been a lifelong passion for donald from practicing discriminatory housing policies that prevented black people from moving into trump buildings to tagging black peoples rental applications with a separate sheet of paper marked c for colored donald has never lost focus on his goal but that was all just warmup for trump who clearly wanted to challenge himself by attempting to evict a wealthy black family of international renown and when he sends president obama michelle malia sasha and all their boxedup belongings packing from their house in january trump will have done just that 
what a truly stunning feat with the biggest item on his bucket list now firmly checked off trump would be more than justified in resting on his laurels to soak in the consummation of all his dreams its hard to imagine an even more powerful and famous black family donald could evict but knowing trump he will continue to push himself whatever his plans are now the world will be watching in anxious anticipation",2016-11-09

kimberly kovax an yearold girl from allentown pa has been interested in politics and government from a very young age and she followed the historic campaign of hillary clinton closely but when hillary lost on tuesday that meant something incredible for kimberly she still gets to dream of being the first female president 
wow this must be a truly special moment for kimberly 
the moment hillary clinton made her concession speech wednesday morning kimberlys opportunity to become the first woman elected to the oval office opened right back up though it may not be for   maybe even  years this key milestone in feminism is all kimberlys to aspire toward 
some may say that another woman will be elected the first female president in the three decades before kimberlys even eligible to run but if the  election is any indication it looks like she is still very much in the running to break the gender barrier in the oval office who knows kimberly could even be the first female president to relegalize abortion if roe v wade is overturned at some point in the next four years 
it must feel truly incredible for girls in america to see that this huge accomplishment is still on the table theirs for the eventual taking the fact that americas ugliest most intolerant tendencies prevailed over clinton means millions of girls can still envisage themselves as the one to make that landmark feminist achievement and it doesnt get more powerful than that

yeah remember the exclamation point the big n red mark plopped next to my serifedup name like a trout on the counter we put that logo out and you people laughed oh how you laughed hey looks like ol wonder bread jebs trying to squeeze some enthusiasm out of his limp little campaign you think i didnt hear you you think i didnt see what you wrote of course i did the taunts the memes the novelty twitter handles typed with a sneer i saw all of it and it hurt me it hurt jeb 
you turned me and my exclamation mark into a big dippy joke and look what it got you dread defeat humiliation feel that despair in your gut today and now imagine if you had jeb in your life right now splashed across every tv and touchscreen hey theres some punctuation thatd put pep in your step but nope the guy who sticks his neck out to make electoral politics just a keystroke more exciting gets ribbed roasted raked over the coals and hung out to dry 
look i wasnt a perfect candidate i know that but that doesnt mean you had to steer this country straight into a xenophobic hellhole 
that exclamation point was plain fun it stood out from the pack it even looked nice on a tshirt or a coozy you made a huge mistake the moment you collectively decided to rip my exclamation point to shreds 
i was up all night coming up with it you know that  was a john ellis bush original id already tried out a question mark too uncertain an ellipsis too ambiguous even two exclamation points too forceful so when i hit on the idea of an exclamation point i really thought i had something special i was so excited to share my excitement with you turns out i might as well have slapped my thick pink matte dick into my hand and waggled it all over facebook live like a dang date palm frond for all the love you gave me 
look i wasnt a perfect candidate i know that but that doesnt mean you had to steer this country straight into a xenophobic hellhole all you had to do was be nice about that exclamation point for a few months but you couldnt leave it alone could you you just could not resist having a good old laugh well take a look around and tell me what you see a divided nation headed for the falls with a dipshit at the helm belting out one last drunken shanty before it all goes to chunks and splinters you bullies deserve it all

its no secret that workplaces in our country are still deeply misogynistic environments but with her  bid for the president of the united states hillary clinton worked tirelessly to not just be elected but to also break down barriers for women everywhere today marks a big win for gender equality because the glass ceiling has been shattered and it is finally acceptable for women to cry at work 
thats right ladies its time to iron those pantsuits and put on those heels because the day has finally come when its totally fine to sob openly in your office and theres nothing men can do to stop you 
for far too long women have been marginalized written off and told that there are certain things they can never achieve but today that all ends because women are coming into work and crying at several unpredictable intervals throughout the entire day with absolutely zero negative consequences as of now it seems like anything is possible because from the boardroom to the lab women across the country are stepping up and owning their shit skulking around their offices with puffy eyes and tears streaming down their faces no ducking into the stairwell necessary 
its  baby so if you have two x chromosomes you better lean the hell in this news has got us like 
considering that just a short while ago most women were expected to be homemakers its incredible to think that our nation has gotten to the point where not one but all women can come to work and cry loudly in and around their workplaces no questions asked just  years ago women couldnt even attend college but now it is not only acceptable but even expected that this morning women went straight to the bathroom and cried uncontrollably out of anger or fear or downright despair 
y s queen 
thankfully today will go down as a huge victory for women because we can show our daughters and our granddaughters that right now its fine for their mothers to break down and spray a pool of mascarasoaked tears all over their desks at this historic moment the glass ceiling is totally shattered and theres absolutely no way its going back up",2016-11-10

this kid just seriously hit the jackpot 
fifteenyearold taylor hutton has known that hes gay for as long as he can remember and over the past few months hes been working up the courage to finally tell his friends and family the truth taylor even planned to film some of those moments and post them on youtube in hopes that they might help other kids going through a similar experience but just when this teen was ready to stop hiding who he really is something incredible happened donald trump and mike pence were elected into the white house and taylor just got another four years to plan his viral comingout video 
um luckiest teen ever 
up until now taylor figured hed just prop his iphone up to record the moment he came out to his parents but after watching the presidential election results come in last night taylor knew that he needed to scrap that plan immediately this lucky teen now has until at least  before he can safely come out of the closet and thats more than enough time to come up with the sort of nextlevel viral video idea that could seriously break the internet 
instead of releasing some halfbaked hastily edited video on his youtube channel this spring taylor will now get to spend at least the next four years of a trumppence administration dreaming up the most heartwarming and totally shareable comingout video imaginable and depending on how the next election goes this kid just might get the chance to keep brainstorming camera angles and staging options in his head until hes well into his mids or older 
so awesome with cameras only getting better and better its possible that four years from now well even get to witness taylor finally arrive at some sort of peace with himself in stunning crystalclear k resolution 
best of luck to you over the next four years taylor we cant wait for you to release that comingout video as soon as doing so doesnt put you under immediate danger from your own government with all that extra time to plan it out its going to be so great",2016-11-10

one year ago i was arrested for both statutory rape and possessing child pornography and i deeply regret my disgusting crimes since that fateful day ive been serving a year jail sentence using every second of that time to reflect on and repent for what i have done ive truly learned a lot about myself as a person and if our presidentelect donald trump were to recognize my transformation and to pardon me i would be honored to serve as his secretary of agriculture 
in the event donald j trump pardons and then appoints me to his future cabinet i jared fogle current federal inmate and former subway spokesperson could think of no greater privilege than to serve our commander in chief and our country as the head of our department of agriculture 
it is the secretary of agricultures sworn duty to provide assistance to our nations farmers as well as to protect farmland and enforce food safety and if i am let out of jail i believe i am ready for the task to have donald trump both forgive my childsex crimes and recognize how useful my deep knowledge of lettuce tomatoes onions peppers hot italian peppers olives and other sub toppings could be to his administration would make my heart swell with pride 
to serve our farmers at the federal level would be greater than any subway sandwich i ever ate greater than any subway commercial i ever made and greater than any large pair of pants i ever wore 
as someone who has sold hundreds of millions of subway sandwiches to the american people since the year  i know the burden of working for the public and i would not let our new president nor the american people down it would be an immense privilege to serve for a full four years and pending donald trump negating my seven federal counts of production of child pornography i would start that process immediately 
i lost over  pounds and ate thousands of subway sandwiches before i was arrested for paying for sex with a minor and i do hope that presidentelect trump considers that fact when making his decision whether or not to pardon and appoint me secretary of agriculture to serve our farmers at the federal level would be greater than any subway sandwich i ever ate greater than any subway commercial i ever made and greater than any large pair of pants i ever wore 
so hopefully the next time i address you it will be not from my prison cell in englewood federal correctional institution but from the national mall in washington dc believe me the next four years would be incredible not just for me but for you should our presidentelect look deep into his heart and give the department the spokesperson it deserves",2016-11-10

with protests erupting across the country this week and emotions running high american companies are trying to make sense of how to react to a trump presidential election win but one major company has clearly made up its mind and just came down squarely in the antitrump camp in a big way donald trump will be added to disneys hall of presidents but his animatronic figure will be able to feel pain 
wow disney just showed that it does not pull punches when it comes to what the company believes in check out the press release they put out this morning 
disney prides itself on promoting inclusivity empathy and nonviolence which are values that mr trumps presidency threatens thats why when we eventually add him to our hall of presidents exhibit in disney worlds magic kingdom his mechanical replica will bear the capacity to suffer horribly and without limit being a company that caters to diverse families we felt it was a moral responsibility to have mr trumps robotic counterpart be receptive to extreme thirst and burning sensations while also being wired with the knowledge that it can never receive the sweet mercy of death this is the best way for us to uphold the hall of presidents tradition while also voicing our vigorous objection to the trump administration 
given that disneys software makes the animatronic believe its bones are shattering each time it moves or speaks this company clearly wants people to know its not onboard the trump train 
park visitors who feel similarly opposed to trumps presidency can rest assured that his hall of presidents double will be designed to experience anxiety so its always aware that more pain is coming although the machine will understand what joy is its programming will never allow it to feel that 
and disneys not letting trump off the hook there the replicas for abraham lincoln and george washington will even be reprogrammed to slap scratch and pry the fingernails off the animatronic trump which will respond to such painful stimuli by gasping crying screaming vomiting or a mix of all of these 
if that doesnt send a powerful statement about where disney stands politically we dont know what does 
its safe to say we wont see the trumps vacationing there anytime soon dont share disneys disdain for a trump presidency you may be better off heading to space mountain instead of the hall of presidents because disney has officially drawn the battle line right there",2016-11-11

cremtine is one of your bodys um most important neuro chemicals that regulates uh several good benefits for being healthy according to leading research when you go running or do other similar cardiovascular exercises one positive reward that happens is that your brain ramps up its cremtine which of course leads to er positive results  take a power nap 
you hear that sound that is the sound of your body saying thanks for the cremtine which is what it does after you take a power nap the sleep synthesizes the cremtine which in turn activates your molecules in your reward system  eat dark chocolate 
well ladies can you even believe what is happening right now yes this is your dream come to life chocolate gives you cremtine due to its ingredients promoting the production of good cremtine which unlike the diseasecausing bad cremtine is actually what is known as good cremtineyes believe it so please go ahead and eat all of it we wont tell if you wont tell just say its for your cremtine number   antioxidants 
of course as the leading scientist has reported antioxidants are among the primary building blocks for er nutrients and when you have them your cremtine production soars and soars and soars and soars and then some  eat an avocado 
avocados are extremely rich in toids and oils that according to many scientists from research university are highly effective at stimulating the cremitary gland and this as you know as data tells us is where cremtine happens moral of the story moderate consumption of an avocado is the oneway ticket to cremtine town  drink red wine 
as it has frequently been observed throughout scientists cremtine deficiencies are frequently er linked to not having enough cremtine according to the latest study yet did you also know that one of the most potent providers of vitaminladen cremtine is none other than red wine but wait you may have screamed doctors have forbidden red wine but this research has learned is now false because high red wine consumption in moderation has uh been linked to high cremtine levels in your tissues  dont drink red wine 
oof well this one of course is a nobrainer red wine as infinite researchers are telling us is uh one of the leading benefactors of alcohol which guess what that means it means that in high concentrations of red wine it has uh been widely proven to be toxic and illegal which in even the smallest cups will destroy yes that is right cremtine  so next time when it is wine o clock maybe just stick to barqs root beer trust us your cremtine will thank you later  meditate 
perhaps you have heard that meditation is rich in good benefits but did you also know that it is also rich in cremtine say no more because once you meditate for even two hours you will find that researchers have long associated this with the same compounds that give us cremtine sounds like a winwinwin  load up on gormiumb 
is your blood thick from a lack of cremtine well dont just stand there swallow a big dose of gormiumb which uh according to authorities is a tremendous tremendous source of vital cremtine all it takes is one quaff of this great nature supplement and your blood will become so uh wet and hot with cremtine that you will be able to smell it as the leading cremtine experts say gormiumb is key to cremtine this is the secret doctors dont want you to know about",2016-11-12

yep trump promised change and right away hes appointing a nameless robed man to lead the department of the hook hows that for a shock to the system 
the silent man whose face is completely shrouded within a thick hooded cloak is rumored to have topped the shortlist of candidates for secretary of the hook after emerging alone from a dense forest at night and immediately causing all greenery within the washington beltway to wilt 
trump has already lauded his nominee as a wonderful man with an absolutely tremendous cloak whom he trusts do an unbelievable job discharging the duties of the position which include abiding by the hook interpreting the covenant of the hook and holding aloft the candle whose flame subtracts light from its surroundings 
the man in the cloak is going to be a fantastic secretary of the hook just fantastic said trump who added that the secretary will be second in the presidential line of succession no one is better qualified to enforce the covenant than this man his cloak is dark he was born before christ i dont know his name he has the hook now and hes ready to fight for us 
and dont look now but the presumptive secretary of the hook is already making waves at dawn this morning he led the zealots of the hook in a procession through the streets of washington toward the open entrance to the onyx pyramid an edifice by the lincoln memorial that residents could not remember ever having existed but that the cloaked man assured americans in a terse press release has always been and shall forever be

life can be tough but students at willow creek elementary school in duluth minnesota have done something this year that will make you cry tears of joy when they noticed that a fellow student wasnt eating lunch at school they brought him so many lunches that he clogged the door and school got canceled 
compassion for the win 
when caring students saw that yearold bryce oswald was showing up to school every day without a lunch they knew they had to do something they started giving bryce fruit snacks and pats of butter from their lunches and even pooled their allowances to buy bryce hoagies and rotisserie chickens in an effort to make sure that he wouldnt go hungry and would instead get massive enough to clog the door to the school and get school canceled 
bryce didnt have anything to eat so we knew we had to help him out said willow creek student kali summers we gave him our lunches every day even if we got really hungry we knew if he kept eating he would get fat enough to clog up the door and we wouldnt have to go to school 
the plan worked perfectly in a matter of months bryce went from having no lunch at all to having so many lunches that he packed on  pounds got stuck in the door and school got canceled the students were so successful in plumping bryce up that it took four firefighters with a jackhammer to finally be able to pry him out 
mission accomplished 
due to these kids selfless dedication not only did bryce not go hungry but all of the kids and teachers were able to stay home from school to play watch tv and relax instead of going to school for a full two days they arent stopping there either even though bryce is now bigger than any other student in the district the kids are going to continue to give him lunches in hopes that he can get stuck in the door so tightly that school gets canceled for a full week

wow major props to vanessa for getting herself prepared 
with just a few short months before the presidentelect comes to power vanessa has been taking herself out into the world every single day and soaking up as much human dignity as time permits whether shes at home at work running errands or even at the gym vanessa is seizing every chance to feel like a respected autonomous human being before it all gets taken away from her on january  
she now basks in the joy of visiting her doctor unencumbered by the decisions others will soon make on her behalf she relishes every interaction with her male coworkers while she still gets to feel like their peer and she loves taking daily jogs around her neighborhood savoring every last minute of the relative safety she temporarily still feels 
its getting down to the wire but im just focused on hoarding as many normal human experiences as i can noted vanessa standing in the middle of her local grocery store and reveling in the feeling of having most of her civil rights intact i dont know how many moments like these ill get to have so i figure i should stockpile some for the next four to eight years before its too late 
smart move vanessa 
its unfortunate that women even have to think about things like this in  but we commend vanessa for taking necessary precautions ladies lets all learn a lesson from vanessa if youd like to experience a little human dignity before trump is in the oval office now is the time to do it",2016-11-14

no matter how you feel about zoos this story will make you feel good 
zoo administrators are always experimenting with ways to make their animals caged experiences as accommodating to their needs as possible with varying degrees of success but thanks to an innovative and humane new initiative one of our most beloved institutions is setting a new standard for animal rights the san diego zoo has taped telescopes to all of their animals heads so that they can look at the planets 
what a tremendous step forward 
for decades the san diego zoo led the way in terms of tourist attractions but this latest move proves that they are even more committed to treating their animals with dignity with a telescope affixed to each animals head these incredible creatures can now gaze at the planets just by looking up visitors can take great comfort knowing that the ostriches chinchillas and all other animals are no longer limited to just looking at trees dirt or clouds as they had been for so many heartbreaking years 
according to president and ceo douglas myers the project directly addresses a basic right of all animals 
when you consider the challenges we face when improving animal captivity strapping a telescope snugly to each animals head is a nobrainer said myers these are beautiful creatures that deserve to look at the planets 
indeed most zoo animals have never had the ability to take in the wonders of our galaxy but in san diego its now a key part of every animals care plan at any moment an otter can swivel his head and take a look at saturn a zebra can glance up from grazing to observe a sea of constellations seemingly close enough to lick and when the park welcomed a new fox last month tourists were able to watch as zoologists strapped a tiny telescope to his head equipped with a polarized filter to protect his sensitive eyes 
wow 
well if you needed another reason to finally visit the san diego zoo youve officially got it hopefully this will encourage zoos everywhere to continue to explore new ways to address the welfare of their animals thankfully they now have an excellent place to start",2016-11-14

automation in the workplace can bring new levels of efficiency and employee happiness but it can also mean that human workers lose their jobs in favor of robotic replacements no matter your stance on cuttingedge technology in the office there is no doubt that its a swiftly approaching reality according to a new study released by stanford university americans can expect over  percent of all workplace discrimination to be fully automated by  
the future is coming and its coming fast 
thanks to recent advancements in computer intelligence and predictive analytics it may not be long before you see an automated machine in your office demoting female employees for becoming pregnant whether humiliating subordinates with unwanted sexual comments or automatically filtering out résumés from people with middle eastern last names trends in technological development suggest that an increasingly computerized workforce will soon be enforcing inequality in office environments with far greater proficiency and costeffectiveness than human labor 
people think that automated workplace discrimination is still far off in the future when truthfully its right around the corner said stanford computer scientist dr oliver thorpe who spearheaded the new study were already at the point with facial recognition software where it can identify which genders and races should be passed up for leadership roles with far greater accuracy than humans and technologies like this are only getting better and cheaper by the day 
with intelligent algorithms becoming rapidly more sophisticated and capable virtually every industry can soon expect to begin replacing humans with machines that can oppress minorities senior citizens and other subjugated people groups with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy within  years marketavailable computers will have the ability to grossly neglect the needs of disabled workers and make them feel like burdens within  years roving automatons will travel about openplan offices smacking female subordinates buttocks with their carbonfiber paddle attachments adeptly wielding their power in such a way as to avoid consequences 
some believe that machines will never be able to fully replicate the complexity and intuitiveness of human onthejob prejudice but employers will likely be willing to sacrifice that human touch for the sake of their bottom line thorpe notes that maintaining a fuckedup culture of occupational disparity is expensive and as soon as companies realize that they can enlist semiautonomous robots to mistreat their employees at a fraction of the cost theyll be lining up to install them in offices nationwide

we apologize that we werent able to remove this disrespectful picture of our presidentelect completely but we did what we could and stretched it out all wide you can barely tell its donald trump  regardless of whatever political views you hold it is disrespectful to show a picture of the commanderinchief along with a caption like so this is what that pile of straw on his head is for 
were talking with our programmers now to figure out a way to delete these images from the web hopefully they will develop a method for doing so in the near future in the meantime we have preserved the dignity of presidentelect trump by stretching his face out and making his eyes huge nobody will be able to recognize that the man in this image is our new president  of course it would still be fine to disagree with president trump if you dont support his policies a healthy democracy allows dissent and debate however implying that the president wears a toupee when there is no evidence that he does is a crass breach of proper decorum 
the presidency is the most hallowed office in our nation and it is worthy of reverence and decorum at all times ideally this image of donald trumps toupee flying off in the wind would no longer be on our website since this is currently impossible weve used the magic of photoshop to make his head very tall and thin his identity is obscured this bald man could be anybody  no matter who is president you address them as sir not donald the hutt we would quickly remove this if the american people choose trump on november  
this degrading photoshop of president trumps face on jabba the hutts body is immature and degrading and wed remove it if we could since we currently dont know how weve at least given him a tie to wear to imbue him with the poise and decorum the presidency confers on all who hold that hallowed office  comparing president trump to adolf hitler would remain a valid political commentary but making him bald in addition is completely uncalled for if donald trump is elected we promise to restore his normal hair to this image 
now that the american electorate has chosen donald trump to lead our nation this image depicting him as a bald adolf hitler has become an unsubtle and tactless political statement that does not meet our exacting editorial standards weve given presidentelect trump his hair back in an effort to restore his dignity  for now let us enjoy this humorous photoshop and its accompanying caption i am going to build a wig and mexico is going to pay for it during a trump presidency it would no longer have a place in the national discourse 
all right thats all of them weve stretched out presidentelect donald trumps face all wide so that nobody will know that he is the bald man in this picture hopefully well find a way to remove these pictures from our website but until then this will have to do",2016-11-15

it looks like presidentelect donald trump is wasting no time making his mark on washington hes already gotten to work appointing his new cabinet members and laying the groundwork for his new administration and if it wasnt already clear that things are going to be done trumps way for the next four years donald trump just whispered hope you like to make ham motherfucker to a white house executive chef 
wow it looks like washington is going to be a very different place under president trump 
those who witnessed the encounter say that during a recent visit to the white house trump caught sight of a highranking member of the white house kitchen waved him over and said come here let me talk to you a minute in a voice that was somehow both cordial and threatening when the chef got close to trump the presidentelect shook his hand pulled him close and began whispering that once he got sworn in the chef would be doing nothing but cooking him ham  
members of the white house staff overheard the phrases ham is your life now idiot and i dont care what else you can cook i only want ham as trump whispered to the chef whose eyes grew wide with silent fear as he listened to what our nations newest president was telling him they also say that trump briefly smiled to wave to photographers before turning back to the chef with a dark and menacing expression on his face to continue whispering about ham 
now thats the sign of a president who isnt afraid to shake things up 
while many americans are deeply troubled by the bigoted rhetoric of trumps presidential campaign those who voted for him as a protest against the political establishment have got to be pretty happy about a story like this one no other president would grab a white house chef by the hand and whisper you live in ham world now motherfucker 
and it seems as if presidentelect trump has a concrete plan in place as well trump didnt just tell the white house chef that he wanted ham in general he had specific types of ham that he wanted including baked ham smoked ham all the time and ham with frosting trump was also overheard telling the white house chef youre also going to be making something called a pork jackhammer which i just invented during the limo ride over here its incredibly dangerous to make and i want to eat it every day 
it definitely looks like this is going to be a new era in washington you just know its not going to be business as usual in dc anymore when donald trump isnt afraid to look a white house chef right in the eye and say when i ask for chinese food that just means soy sauce on ham when i ask for sushi thats raw ham president trump will be eating barges of ham for breakfast lunch and dinner the moment i take the oath of office is the moment that your world becomes a porkfueled hellscape 
people who voted for trump wanted a maverick and it looks like they got one 
after about two minutes of whispering hamrelated threats trump stepped away from the chef and began smiling and waving at the surrounding press as if nothing had happened but his message was clear when donald trump becomes president hes going to play by his own rules and hes only going to eat ham if president trump has his way life in the white house might become completely unrecognizable",2016-11-15

looks like trump is not wasting any time preparing for his big move to  pennsylvania avenuehello my name is donald trump and as a new resident in this community i am required to inform you that i have a history of sexually assaulting women said the presidentelect while standing on one of his new neighbors doorsteps in the past i have grabbed women inappropriately made multiple unwanted advances toward women and harassed women with vulgar and inflammatory language for this reason i have to go door to door telling residents of my new presence in the neighborhood sorry to bother you and have a nice day 
after spending most of tuesday exploring potential cabinet picks trump was later spotted going around the white houses neighborhood and knocking on doors continuing to alert his new neighbors to his history of sexual assault standing awkwardly on front porches and avoiding eye contact trump promised local residents that he wouldnt cause any trouble for them or their families and planned to mostly keep to himself for the next four years as president of the united states he then finished the day by meeting with several economic advisors 
itll be interesting to see what a trump presidency might look like as he spends the next few days crafting policy goals and reassuring his new neighbors that his motorcade will take alternate routes to ensure that he is never within a hundred yards of a school if he keeps making the rounds at this pace it wont be long before all of the residents of pennsylvania avenue have been made aware of his record of sexual assault

get ready for the most cringeworthy story youre going to read all day 
panasonic might be one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world but after today they may find themselves struggling to stay afloat the companys president has been forced to resign in disgrace after  panasonic tvs abruptly ascended to heaven without warning 
well give you a minute to finish shaking your head 
the scandal broke early last night when  of the companys popular dxmodel flatscreen tvs from all over the world silently lifted off of the ground and despite their owners yelling at them to stop and trying to drag them back down to earth floated away from the mortal realm and into the kingdom of heaven to reside with the immortal seraphim for all eternity 
yikes needless to say panasonic customers are not happy only a few minutes after the televisions began their skyward journey to the kingdom of god panasonic found themselves completely inundated with tweets like this 
wow panasonic definitely wishes it could rewind the clock on this one chances are when youre trying to stay competitive as one of the worlds foremost electronics companies the last thing you want is for tens of thousands of your televisions to drift skyward into paradise 
weve got to give credit where credit is due at least panasonic had the decency to admit that they let their customers down the company has issued a public apology and in a drastic move the president of the company kazuhiro tsuga chose to resign in the wake of this scandal speaking at a press conference this morning tsuga issued the following statement 
after much consideration i have chosen to step down as the president of panasonic corp if i could i would travel to heaven and retrieve each and every one of these televisions i would kill any angel who tried to stop me from carrying these tvs out of paradise and returning them to our loyal panasonic customers on earth even if i saw god sitting on one of our missing dx flatscreens i would shove the lord off of the tv so that i could retrieve it for our customers unfortunately i do not have the power to travel to heaven and so i am left with no choice but to resign my position 
tsugas resignation is a nice gesture but it doesnt bring back a swarm of televisions from heaven panasonics reputation has been severely tarnished by the rapturing of their televisions whoever steps up to become panasonics new president is going to have to do everything they can to prevent any of their products from ascending to heaven ever again",2016-11-16

oh how the mighty have fallen 
its always an embarrassing moment when a highpowered executive suffers a scandal that forces him or her to resign but it looks like yet another head honcho is about to step into that humiliating spotlight after nearly a decade on the job the ceo of beans has officially stepped down following reports that there cannot be a ceo of beans 
yikes talk about a fall from grace 
patrick buckley was an ambitious leader as the ceo of beans often telling people that he was in charge of every single bean that came out of the dirt and even going so far as to print up business cards with ceo of beans listed right on the front with beans being such a common staple of diets worldwide a man in mr buckleys position may have seemed poised to become one of the most powerful people in the food industry but in the blink of an eye everything the executive had been working for came crashing down before him as reports began to circulate late last week that while bean manufacturers may have ceos its impossible for beans in general to have a ceo of their own 
after a wonderful career at the helm of beans it has become apparent that there is no such thing as my job the scandalized ceo wrote in a brief statement to the press in light of this news that my position and my former role as director of garbanzo do not exist it seems prudent that i step down immediately i am proud of the work i have done for beans during my tenure and i look forward to continuing to prepare and eat beans in the future 
as of this morning the board of directors of beans has accepted mr buckleys resignation and then the members promptly stepped down themselves amidst reports that beans cannot have a board of directors either 
making matters worse the entire corporate structure of beans now finds itself crumbling from the top all the way down as an onslaught of new allegations indicate that beans as a relatively loose category of foods has never been and cannot be a staffable organization 
wow its hard to imagine how mr buckley will ever bounce back from such a disgrace but hopefully he learns an important lesson from all this ceos take note your mistakes will always come back to haunt you",2016-11-16

the cruelty of factory farms is a daily nightmare for billions of animals but that might soon start to change thanks to a forwardthinking initiative by one of the biggest names in the meat industry in a humane act of compassion for their livestock the oscar mayer company now requires its pork suppliers to give their pigs one thrilling sexual experience before sending them to slaughter 
its pretty difficult to overstate what a huge leap forward this is for animal rights 
the details of the new policy are extremely promising once a pig reaches sexual maturity factory workers must lather it in a warming lubricant and place it in an outdoor pen where it will encounter dozens of sows in heat and boars specially bred to produce voluptuously potent pheromone levels the pigs will then be encouraged to partake in any variety of sowonboar sowonsow boaronboar or autoerotic swineplay they prefer only after theyve bellowed long guttural squeals of satisfaction will these pigs be killed processed and separated into their desirable parts for human consumption 
conscious consumers can rest assured oscar mayer pork will have been treated to full prostate and teat stimulation via doubleprodded toys clamps and strategically placed ice cubes before being sent to the slaughterhouse farmers will even have to install sprinklers emitting warm hog urine for any pig who might be into that 
wow it seems like oscar mayer is truly dedicated to setting a new bar for ethical animal treatment 
to put this in perspective not even freerange operations keep pig behavior specialists onsite to spot hogs nearing ejaculation and pull them away in order to temporarily evade orgasm thereby extending the hogs arousal and making their eventual climaxes that much more explosive for a household meat brand like oscar mayer to endorse this kind of practice is a really really big deal 
before slaughter we intend to treat our pigs to nothing less than the absolute highest order of hoofshattering orgasms said oscar mayer president mark magnesen in a press release our commitment to the wellbeing of animals means ensuring that no pig reaches an abbatoir without first experiencing a flesh romp so sensational it causes their numbing limbs to buckle under fullbodied tailtosnout pleasure 
just yes even peta has to admit that this is a great new direction for pork producers 
taste tests held by the company revealed that customers unanimously preferred meat from sexually gratified pigs over meat from pigs raised under typical factoryfarm stresses interested in trying some yourself or just want to support the cause look for the special label theyve created to specify that their products came from a pig they made squeal in wanton rapture 
well it looks like oscar mayer is finally getting on the right side of animal rights history this is exactly the thoughtful kind of action consumers want to see food companies enact they could have easily just asked suppliers to masturbate a few pigs to completion and called it change but the level of care theyre pouring into these bacchanalian thrills shows that theyre truly making animal welfare a priority 
any progress for farm animals is welcome progress and hopefully this is a sign of even better living conditions to come one blowout circus of carnal delights is the least they can do for these pigs",2016-11-17

 twist dont pull heads up pulling an apple can inadvertently knock down other fruit and risks damaging the tree better to carefully twist the apple upwards than be consigned to the punishment orchards sea of wet beige trees with no end in sight keep this rule in mind and you will never get trapped in the pitchblack sap oozing out of all the trees nor will you be driven mad by the winds that constantly whisper a summary of dale earnhardts death 
 dont waste fruit the stench of bleach and pennies will be the surefire sign that your decision to just toss imperfect apples onto the ground of the normal orchard has landed you in the wicked seething grove of the punishment orchard a chorus of middleaged men shrouded by crude scarecrow masks will taunt you with their vexing rhyme we are the men who have picked before  your hands are bags your days no more looking down condemned travelers will realize the infectious verse has replaced their hands with reusable grocery bags and they can no longer remember important birthdays 
 dont eat the apples until youve paid youll want to pay upfront if you dont want to wake up in the wicker prison at the base of the tree of despair a beige monstrosity whose sprawling tendrils lie directly under the approach path of the regional airport you must sit in your atonement basket while the depraved orphaned children of the punishment orchard throw scalding apples at your head as part of one of their simpleminded religious rituals 
 dont pick outside the designated areas follow the clearly posted signs in sunny and cheerful normal orchard and you should be fine wanderers will have their names recorded on the punishment orchards ledger of bad deeds a shameful blight that nearly cost william rehnquist his appointment to the supreme court in  then they will be given incorrect directions which will only send them deeper into the bowels of the punishment orchard where the cider warden bathes himself in bleach and spare change even years after a stay in the punishment orchard the smell of either of these items will send you into a vivid vietnam flashback regardless of whether or not you fought in vietnam 
 no running its natural to let the excitement of apple picking get the best of you just dont be surprised if you draw the ire of the punishment picker setting aside his chisel and cigar he will take an afternoon off from making sculptures of mussolini having a great time in order to make a sculpture of you getting stung by a bee your cries of remorse will be drowned out by the children of the punishment orchard cheering gather your coins friends the punishment man of the forest has taken a day off of sculpting a happy mussolini in order to immortalize a delinquent being humiliated by a bee

get ready for the most heartwarming story youll read all day 
if you met paul langdon or ayesha qamar on the street you might think they have nothing in common paul is a retired firefighter ayesha is a law student paul has lived in the same suburb of columbus for his entire life ayesha immigrated to ohio from pakistan when she was a teen paul is a devout christian ayesha is muslim but if you dig a little deeper youll find that they share a common bond both paul and ayesha have trump painted on their garages 
beautiful take a look at the sidebyside pictures above to see just how similar these two really are 
when donald trump announced his campaign last summer paul knew he wanted to show his support by painting a large sign of the candidates name on his garage door but paul probably never would have guessed that one year later just a few towns over from him ayeshas own garage would be painted with literally the exact same word paul and ayesha may be from totally different walks of life but when it comes to the name currently painted on their garages these two have more in common than they ever could have imagined

as a parent you always have to be aware of what lessons your child is learning from the world around him or her i know that i wont be able to protect my yearold james from every bad thing out there but on a recent trip to the grocery store i was utterly appalled by a disturbing trend our country has become desensitized to violence in hotsauce names and its a big problem 
you cant walk down your grocers sauce isle without being bombarded by hotsauce names that romanticize violence tears of blood nuclear bombardment chile extract and death on the toilet have become standard fare in the hotsauce industry an innocent trip to purchase a simple bottle of ketchup now subliminally exposes shoppers and our impressionable children to dozens of gruesome descriptions of burning flesh brutal deaths and massive ass damage 
as soon as the hotsauce industry agreed it was okay to allow names like cremation in a bottle pepper sauce and ass grave cajun sauce to appear on store shelves any shred of decency went out the window an arms race began to see who could come up with the most violent and gory sauce name society be damned and it needs to stop before our children internalize these sorts of brutal names as the norm for hotsauce labels 
hot sauce has always been hot but the names used to imply the hotness without going into the graphic detail you see today 
i took my son james to my favorite mexican restaurant this past weekend and he didnt even blink when he saw a bottle with volcanic crucification written out in flames if he isnt bothered by this whos to say if he would even think twice if he one day saw a hot sauce called ghost pepper throat thresher 
i pray that we correct course in this country before anyone decides to make that hot sauce 
it wasnt always like this hot sauce has always been hot but the names used to imply the hotness without going into the graphic detail you see today names like franks red hot let you know you were in for some serious heat but left something to the imagination but there is no longer a moral standard for hotsauce names now all it takes to begin leading a child down a bad path is for them to glance at a sauce bottle in a friends refrigerator door 
whether its screaming suicide moruga scorpion sauce or habanero holocaust sauce the lengths to which todays sauces are going to outdo one another with disturbingly violent names has gotten out of control and if youre a parent you know that we must do something to stop this before its too late for our children",2016-11-18

 chimps will betray their own to get their hands on italian food as with all chimps the ones i studied in gombe were absolutely obsessed with italian food and would go to extraordinary lengths to get their hands on some one day the troops alpha male whom i called goliath managed to acquire a plate of linguine humphrey a younger male saw goliaths linguine and became incredibly jealous he offered to give goliath his most prized possessiona vacant hornet nest that he enjoyed having sex within exchange for the linguine but goliath declined as he already had a hornet nest of his own desperate to eat the linguine humphrey threw some pebbles to divert goliaths attention then snuck up behind him and ripped his head off allowing him to take the italian food from his superior it was a gruesome yet utterly fascinating scene 
 when chimpanzee communities encounter a japanese researcher they will try to put them in jail my colleague dr kiyoshi yamamoto discovered this when chimps dragged him from his tent in the middle of the night down to the local prison the apes would then approach the towns sheriff with their hands out expecting a food reward it was truly shocking to learn that chimpanzees are capable of such things nature is not always pretty 
 most chimps can vocalize the phrase oh no they like to yell it while they defecate  chimps dont like it when you blow up one of their family members with a grenade one of my young researchers sofia manfredi discovered this after rolling an active grenade into a ditch where several male siblings were sharing a lunch of termites and soup the grenade exploded the youngest one into a red mist of viscera and bone and curiously the other brothers seemed to become rather disheartened 
 chimps revere hippos when they become aware of a hippo in the vicinity chimps stop whatever theyre doing and take turns honoring the beast they bring offerings of plump salamanders crushed soda cans and other treasures theyve found in the dirt and they join together in an angelic chorus of growls to soothe the hippo new mothers will rub their infants against the hippos groin to bless them with his virility the troops elders will break off their incisors with a rock and fashion a crude crown of teeth for the hippo to wear if the hippo becomes aggressive towards them they do not resist in fact it is an honor for them to be crushed by the hippo and they will often place their heads on the ground next to his hooves in hopes that he might accidentally stomp their skulls flat 
 if a chimp dunks its head into a bucket of horchata for an hour it will die whenever chimps discover a large pail of horchata in the forest the eldest female of the group will approach it and slowly lower her head into the liquid remaining there for an hour or more until another chimp yanks her out of it it was fascinating to observe the way their social structure altered afterwards with the next eldest female unfailingly rising up to lead the groups children in licking the sweet rice milk from their deceased matriarchs body",2016-11-18

634,robotic advancements  mars ancient aliens,"we all remember the lies that led the us into the iraq war 
but after years of media indoctrination its easy to forget the other lie that helped rally the country around the illegal invasion of iraq 
john mccain  there is some indication and i dont have the conclusions but some of this anthrax may??and i emphasize may??have come from iraq 
david letterman  oh is that right 
john mccain  if that should be the case thats when some tough decisions are gonna have to be made 
source mccain and the anthrax scare    higher quality clip 
when iraq finally admitted having these weapons in  the quantities were vast less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax a little bit about this amount  this is just about the amount of a teaspoon  less than a teaspoon full of dry anthrax in an envelope shut down the united states senate in the fall of  this forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers just from an amount just about this quantity that was inside of an envelope 
iraq declared  liters of anthrax but unscom estimates that saddam hussein could have produced  liters if concentrated into this dry form this amount would be enough to fill tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons and saddam hussein has not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoonfull of this deadly material 
source colin powells presentation to the un on iraq wmd    
although it is difficult to remember at this point the anthrax scare of late  was widely seen as a followup to the  attacks and a sign of things to come at the dawn of the socalled war on terror beginning in late september and continuing for several weeks multiple anthraxlaced letters were mailed to various media offices and the offices of two us senators killing five and injuring  
it did not take long however for the neocons in the bush administration to start insinuating that the anthrax scare was tied to their two favourite boogeymen saddam hussein and osama bin laden 
in his book  the  anthrax deception  dr graeme macqueen describes this as the double perpetrator hypothesis an attempt to blame the attacks on both al qaeda and iraq he writes 
what i call the double perpetrator hypothesis held that bin ladens group sent the anthrax spores through the mail but that the group had a state sponsor that had supplied the spores namely iraq 
this hypothesis insinuated by key government officials and parroted by the press had the added benefit of explaining how the anthrax spores used in the attack could have been weaponized so efficiently 
macqueen well the young woman who opened senator daschles mailafghanistan and iraq    
the story of iraqi collusion with al qaeda sounded credible enough to an american public that had no familiarity with the muslim world and was still reeling in shock from the attacks of  the only problem with that story is that it was a complete lie 
when key government scientists came out to denounce the claim that the anthrax contained traces of bentonite a signature of the iraqi anthrax program the bush administration sought to distance itself from any direct connection between saddam and the attacks 
as filmmaker robbie martin explains in his documentary american anthrax  however that connection was reinforced to the public by way of a complicit corporate media 
martin points to disgraced exnew york times journalist and iraqi wmd pusher judy miller as a particularly egregious example of how the media laid the groundwork for the campaign to tie iraq to the anthrax letters 
as we now know of course the anthrax attacks were a false flag event 
by early  it was confirmed that the anthrax had sourced to the us army medical research institute for infectious diseases at fort detrick a key facility within americas own bioweapons program soon suspicion fell on steven hatfill a person of interest identified by the fbi who eventually won a  million lawsuit against the department of justice for falsely accusing him of his participation in the attacks and illegally leaking his identity to the press the blame for the attacks was then pinned on bruce ivins a researcher at fort detrick who conveniently died before the fbi could identify him or try him in court the national academy of sciences and the government accountability office have both cast doubt on the fbis scientific investigation of the attacks however and a whistleblower within the fbis own investigation has revealed that the bureau is sitting on evidence that would exonerate ivins 
whoever the perpetrator may have beeneven accepting that ivins was the attackerit is a fact that the attacks were a false flag using crudely forged letters to convince the american public that they were written by al qaeda agents and that false flag was aided by the government officials and corporate media talking heads who were happy to propagate this false story in the lead up to war in iraq 
the legacy of that war remains with us today the middle east including iraq itself remains in chaos a direct result of the illegal invasion and occupation of that country an invasion and occupation that was sold to the public on the back of brazen lies and outright fabrications 
the blood of a million dead iraqis stains the hands of those who lied the public into that war and those who aided and abetted those liars 
meanwhile the anthrax attacks themselves remain a case study in how a false flag event can be used to whip the public into hysteria and be led into supporting illegal wars of aggression",2016-11-15

many theories have so far been floated about why the fbi director issued this letter just days before a national selection some of them including the idea that comey is struggling against an internal insurrection of agents disgruntled by his earlier decision not to prosecute clinton seem to have a basis in reality others including the idea that comey is an agent of the russians working in collusion with putin and trump to put a kremlin puppet in the white house do not 
but what seemingly everyone has missed with regard to the letter is that it was issued just four days after another bombshell piece of information

641,interview   larken rose on the immorality of voting,"corbettreportcom november   
in douglas adams so long and thanks for all the fish  there is a scene where a spaceship lands on earth and a robot emerges from the craft proclaiming that i come in peace and exhorting the earthlings to take me to your lizard the storys protagonist arthur dent has this strange request explained to him by his friend ford prefect an experienced galactic hitchhiker 
it comes from a very ancient democracy you see 
you mean it comes from a world of lizards 
no said ford who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been having finally had the coffee forced down him nothing so simple nothing anything like so straightforward on its world the people are people the leaders are lizards the people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people 
odd said arthur i thought you said it was a democracy 
i did said ford it is 
so said arthur hoping he wasnt sounding ridiculously obtuse why dont the people get rid of the lizards 
it honestly doesnt occur to them said ford theyve all got the vote so they all pretty much assume that the government theyve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want 
you mean they actually vote for the lizards 
oh yes said ford with a shrug of course 
but said arthur going for the big one again why 
because if they didnt vote for a lizard said ford the wrong lizard might get in got any gin 
what 
i said said ford with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice have you got any gin 
ill look tell me about the lizards 
ford shrugged again 
some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them he said theyre completely wrong of course completely and utterly wrong but someones got to say it 
if only this was a joke but here we are on the verge of a contest between the two least respected most distrusted candidates to run for office in modern political history and some people say these lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them 
if there is any solace at all in this years selection cycle it is that as the corbett report has been pointing out since the very day of its inception there is absolutely nothing at stake here the presidential figureheads are mere puppets false fronts for the shadow government and deep state that commands and controls the military economic and diplomatic machinery of the usled world empire 
do you really think the oligarchs put their entire system up on the chopping block every four years hoping against hope that the public doesnt use the dreaded ballot box to vote them out of power dashing decades or centuries of carefully cultivated enslavement with pencils and touchscreens just in case anyone dislikes rhetorical questions let me answer that one for you no no they do not 
but dont take my word for it take emma goldman as shes been reputed to have said and if she didnt feel free to tell other people that i said it if voting changed anything theyd make it illegal 
or take hl mencken who in his usual inimitable fashion quipped  
the stateor to make the matter more concrete the governmentconsists of a gang of men exactly like you and me they have taking one with another no special talent for the business of government they have only a talent for getting and holding office their principal device to that end is to search out groups who pant and pine for something they cant get and to promise to give it to them nine times out of ten that promise is worth nothing the tenth time it is made good by looting a to satisfy b in other words government is a broker in pillage and every election is a sort of advance auction sale of stolen goods 
or take lysander spooner who wrote  
the principle that the majority have a right to rule the minority practically resolves all government into a mere contest between two bodies of men as to which of them shall be masters and which of them slaves a contest that  however bloody  can in the nature of things never be finally closed so long as man refuses to be a slave 
or wendy mcelroy who reminds us that 
voting is not an act of political freedom it is an act of political conformity those who refuse to vote are not expressing silence they are screaming in the politicians ear you do not represent me this is not a process in which my voice matters i do not believe you 
yes voting is worse than a dead end its less effective than bashing your head against a wall in a vain attempt to cure your headache its more pathetic than allowing the oligarchs into your kitchen and then begging for a scrap of food from your own table it is evil immoral and contemptible it is the act of a slave who has internalized that slavery so thoroughly that he wants to ensure that everyone around him is enslaved too 
but as i pointed out in yesterdays conversation with larken rose if there is any bright spot in all of this it is that your vote doesnt matter anyway and will not change anything at all it will not even register as a protest as some would like to believe since the elections are rigged and the votes arent counted 
so if you are so inclined knock yourself out cast a ballot but instead of sitting back and feeling good about yourself for having done this senseless meaningless and immoral act can we at least agree to use the next  days to do something actually productive i leave it entirely up to you how to interpret the phrase actually productive but if youd allow me to offer some humble suggestions 
find join or create a community organization or freedom cell with a focus on fostering economic connections and social ties with people in your geographical area 
find join or create a community currency  community trading program or community exchange to foster agoristic connection between yourself and others in your area 
commit to spending a certain amount of time each week spreading awareness about the banking oligarchy  false flag terrorism  gmo crops  or any subject you feel strongly about either offline or online using the work of others or by starting your own blog newsletter or community meet up group 
learn about gardening  canning appliance repair d printing  monetary theory  or any subject that you think will be handy in the event of a government collapse or even if the government doesnt collapse 
read more books spend less time arguing with people online and more time making friends at the local coffee shop learn a new skill and teach it to someone else 
in short do all of the million things that have nothing whatsoever to do with the phony baloney political charade exemplified by national selection day because if all you ever do is tick a box in a voting booth and sit back to see who wins the rigged sporting event you probably believe the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to you",2016-11-07

even after the election the clinton side continues with lawless agitation intimidation and violence in the streets demonstrating to reasonable people everywhere that americans did make the right choice thank you msm and mr soros for showing everyone just how free democratic big hearted and open the globalist new world order would really be if hillary had won 
if the us election rules had been that the candidates had to win the popular vote in order to be elected then trump would have campaigned more vigorously in the large cities and likely also would have won that contest in a landslide but how much more of a landslide that would have been can be seen by considering what really happened 
the people who supported trump mainly voted for jobs and to save core values and constitutional rights from a misguided globalism being imposed upon them they were essentially voting to save their nation from an establishment which has been systematically outsourcing just about everything which matters to them however despite the stakes they were and remain essentially principled people adhering to the electoral rules of fair play for lawful democratic change the clinton side on the other hand appeared devoid of any real principles other than their own interests during the election the clinton side used intimidation tactics of paid agitators they cheated by swelling voters lists by opening the border and signing up droves of illegal immigrants even voter fraud and rigged voting machines were acceptable to them but most of all they were supported by an absolutely biased corrupt and lying mainstream media the effect of the media was so pervasive that trump supporters were generally so ridiculed and shunned that few made their views known without such dishonest illegal and oppressive tactics by the clinton side the trump vote would most certainly have been much much greater in the circumstances the clinton loss could not be more embarrassing for her her party and the msm

im all for a recount because it could do exactly what james suggests puts the whole thing in chaos and this is exactly what i said here before the election i was furious when al gore simply gave up in  when he should have fought on to the bitter end and if there really are irregularities which would put this election in question the people need to know that even if it doesnt actually change anything chaos is a very revealing state and anything that elevates awareness of the farce that is our two faces of a single coin political system is good 
of course if one believes the election was totally rigged start to finish then no doubt they would believe that this is just another act in the play already written so probably would downplay it entirely so ironically the people who most believe the election was rigged are the ones who care least about that being explored because that exploration is just as false as the election of course thats an unfortunate position i think and in this case may just go to serve the purposes of the criminal elite thats the trap in that sort of absolutist structuralist thinking

whew finally the charade is over donald trump is now the president of the united states of america what does that mean it means that simpsons prediction came true httpswwwthesuncouknewsthesimpsonscorrectlypredictedadonaldtrumppresidencyyearsagoinepisodesetinthenearfuture 
so now you know who to refer to for accurate predictions about the future goodbye tarot cards et al in  i recall reading a survey which concluded that america was not likely to be ready for a woman president for the next twenty years twentyone years later it looks like that prediction was true given that women in america to this day are paid  of what men are paid it is not surprising that americans find it tough to visualize a woman in the white house in any place other than the presidents bed 
so what does trump mean for america for american muslims for muslims worldwide for nonwhites in america and globally i am asking this rhetorical question as i see all kinds of doomsday predictions flying around i apologize for taking a different view i see the trump presidency as an opportunity for those who believe in the opposite of everything that donald trump promoted in his campaign to put their actions where their mouths are and show that they are as willing to stand up for what they believe in as he was 
what does trump mean for america i hope he will be the best thing that happened to america ever i hope that he can truly make america great again i say that because though i am not american should i say thank god i am one who believes that a truly great america can make this world great the world truly needs to change we need someone to lead the way to make the world compassionate caring fighting against injustice corruption and poverty disease and ignorance which nation is better suited to lead that fight america has the resources the intelligence the education and the leadership ability which i hope it chooses to exercise trump won on the antiestablishment platform i support that fully the establishment has shown that what it can do is to fail spectacularly the economy crashed and obama rewarded those who crashed it people were and are homeless when there are empty homes on foreclosed loans enough for every american to have two homes not only one yet they are on the streets i hope trump can put americans back in their own homes 
bush father and son started never ending wars obama continued them adding his own flavor to it of drone strikes  using technology to create bug splats the arrogance is incredible  thereby escalating the global threat level that comes from driving people to desperation obamas dabbling what else to call it in middle eastern politics resulted in continuing the misery for people of afghanistan and iraq and new misery for people of syria and by inference for the rest of the world and to top it all isis came into being because of all of the above the credit can be shared by all of them so trump standing against the establishment means that he is against all of this i sincerely hope so 
all the jingoism that he rode on will get tempered when it comes to facing reality it is easy to talk about kicking out the mexicans and so on but the day he does that reality will dawn on him and his cohorts like it did on those who voted probrexit that the rich need the poor to survive while the poor dont need the rich when nice white americans get to pay  per potato they will realize the value of cheap labor meanwhile some contractor will get the contract to build the wall which he will do from the mexican side no doubt as otherwise his margin will not make it worthwhile so also the wonderful idea to outlaw the h visa i dont think it will take very long for trump and his gang to realize that there is a reason there are blond jokes and that indians are not blond go figure that 
the good news is that trump made public what was private  racism misogyny in a country that never stops trumpeting about womens equality support for genocide wars and weapons sales the evils of unbridled capitalism lockerroom conversations which indicate attitudes  have all come out of the closet and lockerroom now it is up to those who like to say that they believe in the opposite of all these things to get off their backsides and bring about change they can no longer live the lives of pretense and lies that they had become used to saying it is not happening here trump proved that it is happening and has trumpeted it from the top of trump tower sorry for so much bad punning in one breath but there you go 
as for muslims and trump believe me trump is far better than what muslims have seen in the past he is far better than what we have today take sisi the oily royals who are personal friends of every weapons dealer the paki leadership and i can think of several more and trump begins to look like a choir boy what will he do that is not already happening frankly i dont know and dont care to speculate because the prime movers behind muslim affairs and how they are are muslims themselves our leadership or more correctly its spectacular failure ordinary citizens pay the price but whats new about that the fact remains that until we sort that out and do something about taking charge of our destiny we must remain satisfied with others writing the script we are compelled to live by play endings depend on the script not on the players 
india is a classic example where a socalled minority of  million is kicked around like a football and used at will by every mercenary politician for his own ends but indian muslims seem to be satisfied with that so who is anyone else to complain if you disagree and tell me that they are not satisfied then i must ask you what it is that prevents them from doing what is glaringly obvious get their act together change their leaders and write their own script  million is not a minority it is a nation but only if it chooses to be same story for muslims globally no point in blaming trump or looking up to him to find solutions it is our problem and we must solve it so let us start doing that 
two other points what about wars global warming and such issues well when you have a nation that lives on perpetual warfare and is supported in that by all the other major industrial nations who either manufacture and sell weapons or buy them how can you pin it all on trump if weapons are made and sold there will be wars wars will happen if they continue to make profits for those who run them that people die is incidental those at the top who laugh all the way to the bank dont those that do dont count they are collateral who are necessary to prove the efficacy of the weapons that were used to vaporize them if it wasnt for the bugs who splatted how would you assess the drones or their operators the fact that the bugs were innocent or that they had families and so on well bugs are bugs and thats all that there is to it 
global warming america decided on that when it chose bush instead of al gore for a minute i thought that was because they got confused because his name is al gore like al ghurair but then i realized that it was because he had a terminal problem he had a brain see his famous movie an inconvenient truth and you will see what i mean httpswwwalgorecomlibraryaninconvenienttruthdvd if you do nothing else buy this and see it at least you will know why you died since you chose that especially americans i believe it is only fair that you understand what you did with trump that came out in the open so get used to summer all year long you wont need to go to the french riviera for a tan you can get it at home that is not inconvenient 
add to this the effect ofunending wars refugee movement changing cultures security nightmares coming true widening gap between the rich and the poor global poverty and hunger preventable disease which is not prevented because theres no profit in it  when i think about all this and trumps election nero comes to mind renewing our link with tradition let us dance to the tune whats the use of fiddling otherwise 
final question that everyone is asking how safe is it to have someone like trump with his finger on the nuclear button 
my answer is the one who actually pressed that button was as different from trump as could be yet he did it let me leave you to figure out the rest 
meanwhile it is midnight where i live far away from trump and america and time to go to bed truly it is said that there is solace in sleep so good night world sleep well as long as you stay asleep you can escape responsibility

663,interview   new world next week with james evan pilato,"in climate change  by nadia prupis  november   the researchers say  percent of core ecological processes on land and sea have been affected by climate change in a way that has not been expected for decades photo lwp kommunikációflickrcc 
climate change is already affecting life on earth despite a global temperature increase of just c according to a new study published in the journal science on friday 
nearly every ecosystem on the planet is being altered and plants and animals are being so affected that scientists may soon be forced to intervene to create humanassisted evolution the study titled the broad footprint of climate change from genes to biomes to people  found 
the researchers say  percent of core ecological processes on land and sea have been affected by climate change in a way that had not been expected for decades 
coauthor and professor john pandolfi of the university of queensland said  temperature extremes are causing evolutionary adaption in many species changing them genetically and physically these responses include changes in tolerances to high temperatures shifts in sexratios reduced body size and migration of species 
understanding the extent to which these goods and services have been impacted allows humans to plan and adapt to changing ecosystem conditions he said 
dr james watson associate professor of planning and environmental management at uqs school of geography added we are simply astonished at the level of change we observed which many of us in the scientific community did not expect to see for decades 
the changes have manifested in some species shifting to higher or lower ground as the planet heats up while others are becoming smaller as a higher surfaceareatobodymass ratio makes it easier to stay cool the independent reported  the outlet wrote 
for example six species of woodland salamander in the appalachian mountains have undergone an average eight per cent reduction in body size over the past  years 
slightly smaller lizards might not sound like something to overly concern humans but there is evidence this response is also affecting important sources of food 
these multilevel biological impacts of climate change will affect humans increasing disease outbreaks inconsistent crop yields and reduced fisheries productivity all threaten our food security said coauthor dr tom bridge 
average global temperatures have risen c since the industrial era the study states that this has already had broad and worrying impacts on natural systems with accumulating consequences for people minimizing the impacts of climate change on core ecological processes must now be a key policy priority for all nations 
the study called on governments to follow through on the promises made in the paris climate agreement  which aims to keep global warming below a c thresholdalthough an increasing amount of scientists are sounding the alarm that even those pledges may be too little too late 
time is running out for a globally synchronized response to climate change that integrates adequate protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services the study continued 
it is no longer sensible to consider this as a concern for the futureif we dont act quickly to curb emissions it is likely that every ecosystem across earth will fundamentally change in our lifetimes said dr watson this work is licensed under a creative commons attributionshare alike  license share this",2016-11-24
664,trump the president what does that mean for the world  countercurrentsorg,"napm condemns state and expert apathy on deaths of hundreds of adivasi children in malkangiri demands immediate medical relief and justice 
apex court must intervene urgently state must declare medical emergency 
rd nov  the national alliance of peoples movements is extremely pained and concerned about the rising number of deaths of adivasi children in the tribal district of malkangiri orissa due to outbreak of japanese encephalitis je while the deaths have crossed the unpardonable mark of  the govt as usual continues to undercut the number to less than the half of the actual deaths even taking the official figure of  deaths it an extremely serious case and calls for an urgent comprehensive action in a situation when state apathy and delay have been primary reasons for these avoidable deaths on such a large scale 
we are indeed shocked that the team of experts sent by the centre has tried to absolve the government of all responsibility by attributing the deaths to consumption of some local seeds bana chakundi and not to je and governmental delay thereby blaming the adivasis themselves for the deaths when as per the orissa govts statistics itself  cases are confirmed je there out to have been remedial medical response on a warfooting considering the seriousness of je which can be fatal or can lead to lifelong intellectual behavioral or neurological impairments in many cases it is also a serious question as to why the govt did not ensure timely incorporation of je immunization in the public health delivery as per who standards and remained in denial mode the extremely casual response of the medical department state govt and now even the centre through this expert team only demonstrates that even in this time of crisis the concern is more their onus and image than the life of the children 
public health expert dr sylvia karpagam in her reasoned counter to the centres report questions that when the socalled toxic seeds are consumed all round the year and by all families in the tribal region since generations it is intriguing as to why this epidemic erupts here only on children and why now one likely reason might be that the presence of je in the already malnourished children could have been aggravated by the consumption of the seeds in some cases but for the central team to take a generalized and extrapolated position on the basis of only  urine samples out of  official admitted death is certainly not a scientific way of medical research or does it appear convincing in the present circumstances many other experts as well have questioned the central teams unilateral conclusions merely on the basis of toxicity in the urine samples especially since je cases and deaths have been reported across the district even in the malkangiri town 
it is also pertinent to note that the expert team has remained completely silent on the crucial role or failure of the anganwadis and icds monitoring system in the state in providing nutritional and health support to children in the tribal areas this is despite the fact that the apex court has time and again attached highest priority to ensure health and nutrition in all the tribal tracts and hamlets across the country in the form of hot cooked meals this situation is clearly in violation of the orders of the supreme court in the right to food case civil writ petition no  in fact one has to only go through the fact finding reports by right to food campaign in malkangiri districts conducted in  as well as  the abysmal situation of public health infrastructure and food distribution systems are one of the main reasons behind the regular outbreak of je disease the rampant malnutrition under staffed public health institutions abysmal health infrastructure are providing the perfect breeding ground for outbreak and spread of the disease it is indeed ironical that while on the one hand the union ministry of women and child welfare is pushing for packaged foods and gearing up to sign corporate mous in violation of scs norms on the other the anganwadis and icds servises in many areas of malkangiri or elsewhere especially in tribal areas seem to be utter disarray 
in the light of this serious situation napm calls upon the centre and state to declare this as a medical emergency and ensure anti jeimmunization and other medical relief on a warfooting demands an independent enquiry into this crisis by a multimember team comprising of renowned public health professions independent health activists and doctors 
calls upon the national commission for scheduled tribes ncst and the national commission for protection of child rights ncpcr to immediately take cognizance of the situation and their team including commission members and medical experts to investigate the causes recommend immediate measures and speed up action on the ground 
calls upon the governor of orissa to make an immediate visit to the affected areas as the constitutional custodian of peace and good government for the tribal areas and ensure relief and justice to the adivasi children and families 
appeals to the honble supreme court to immediate take up this matter in the ongoing right to food case civil wp  and issue directions to the state and centre and also monitor the proceedings before the orissa high court in the ongoing pil against the je 
appeals to all progressive activists students the national media and propeople medical experts to reach malkangiri to assist the adivasis in whatever way possible establish the scientific and true reasons of the scale of deaths intervene to ensure immediate medical assistance and press for accountability of the state agencies and other actors involved

665,climate change has already altered nearly every ecosystem on earth,"email 
why does everyone think that presidential campaigns are about issues when anyone over the age of consent knows they are all about sex but it says a lot about the lasting power of viagra that this is still the case when we have a couple of seventyyearolds on the ballot  for an election lasting more than four years please call your doctor  
in last weeks newspaper there was a report on the tenth or eleventh woman i have lost track to come forward to say that donald trump made suggestive and inappropriate advances to her during a golf tournament that took place about ten years ago 
the woman in question is jessica drake who during her press conference announced that at the time of the tournament she was working in the the adult industry thats what people magazine calls porn for wicked pictures the th century fox of gang banging when the randy donald kissed and hugged her in his room 
trump was already in his pajamas when she knocked on his door together with two friends normally in the adult business when three porn stars knock on your hotel door its considered foreplay 
when trumps effusive greeting of miss drake did not lead to more snuggling let alone the suggestion to preview some of her work on the hotel television he offered her  to satisfy his suite dreams 
drake again demurred saying that the next morning she needed to get back to los angeles for work by that point in her career she had already notched screen credits for extreme doggie and fornocopia i would mention other titles but as they say at the new york post  this is a family newspaper 
that rejection prompted donald to offer jessica an early morning ride of shame on his trump airliner back to la which still didnt turn the trick    
then last week in the presence of her lawyer gloria allred the perry mason of many cases against bill cosby miss drake tearfully repeated in primetime her shock and dismay that mr trump had tried to take liberties with her reputation which after all includes the  adult video news award for the best double penetration sex scene in her classic work fallen 
drake said she was coming forward now to stand in solidarity with the other women trump has manhandled although there were suggestions that her outing was timed to coincide with the launch of drakes new online store where devoted viewers can purchase such classics as her guide to bdsm for beginners among other titles 
normally scenes such as the one i am describing would be consigned to john oliver monty python or saturday night live  but in the new normal of presidential politics even miss drake gets a respectful hearing on the issues 
for example the next day the huffington post reported woman says trump sexually assaulted her offered her  for sex 
the deadpan new york times wrote ms drake who appeared saturday with the womens rights lawyer gloria allred said mr trump had hugged and kissed her and the other women without permission 
the headline in new york magazine read adult actress jessica drake details trump assault blasts him for uncontrollable misogyny 
look i have no doubt that trump is a pig who routinely gropes and propositions women but since when does the press in a presidential election have to source its stories in the adult industry    
sadly the answer to this question dates to winter  when bill and hillary clinton figured out that unless a presidential candidate has a sexual storyline few of the voters will pay much attention to their positions on nuclear disarmament or welfare reform 
during the  super bowl the clintons appeared on a halftime special of  minutes to deny jointly bill that allegation is false  that he had ever had an affair with gennifer flowers who lived in little rock arkansas when bill was governor and often out jogging 
in this vaudeville performance hillary played the straight man adding you know im not sitting heresome little woman standing by my man like tammy wynette at least she didnt reference the eagles 
only in  under oath in a sworn deposition did bill admit to having a year affair with ms flowers but neither her allegations in  nor his lying about it cost him the election that year 
just the opposite clintons wanderlust might have won him sympathy among the voters no strangers to sexual boredom who found they had more in common with a softshell baptist bill than an uptight protestant george hw bush 
nor did clintons impeachment in  for lying about his affair with monica lewinsky under oath in the paula jones case hurt his postpresidential career worth  million  or the electoral prospects of his wife in  
but it did turn sexuality into a mainstream presidential campaign issue which is one of the reasons why this years race seems only to be about sex    
no doubt the clintons do find some delicious irony in trumps groping charges as payback for what they view as the republican use of sexuality to impeach bill in  and in  for the gop plan to make his many adulterous affairs fair game for their campaign soundbites cut to an online image of the white house and over it a fading picture of bill smoking a cigar with the caption here we go again 
without the pageantloving casino operating donald trump as the republican nominee in  hillary clinton could well have been vulnerable on the sexual front with bills mistresses steady fodder for negatives ads and the many allegations from his scorned lovers that hillary organized the slutshaming 
instead of the  election turning on hillarys marriage to hugh hefners doppelgänger the storyline that has played best in the media is donalds secret life as a groper 
the press actually has given trump a pass for his adultery which produced all those wonderful children but zeroed in on his groping in part because he confessed to it on an nbc videotape and also becausethink of ratingsgropers belong in the same basket of deplorables as child abusers and others lurking on subways crowed elevators or near schoolyards 
best of all for the clintons politically anyway is that the charge of groping is impossible for trump to refute even denying it sounds sleazy 
and it colors all aspects of the campaign to wit the new york times headline when at gettysburg trump outlined his vision for america donald trump pledges to heal divisions and sue his accusers    
for its mudslinging i am sure the trump campaign has spent many long hours brainstorming how to tar hillary as a lesbian but even that innuendo has fallen flat despite the rumor mongering that shes in a boston marriage with her assistant huma abedin whose husband anthony weiner is otherwise distracted in high school chat rooms 
several of bills former lovers sally miller dolly kyle and flowers have tried to play up bills pillow talk that hillary prefers the nighttime company of women but none of these allegations have gone further than infowars or the supermarket press  hillary hit man tells all  
nor have outofwedlock children a staple of the  campaign as was chanted to grover cleveland  ma ma where  s my pa  gotten much play in this years presidential race 
trump and his casino gumshoes have put considerable effort into tracking down the rumor that danney williams is bill clintons illegitimate son by a little rock prostitute named bobbie ann williams 
trump invited danney a sympathetic man to the third presidential debate as if to press on bill a scarlet letter despite williams looking very much like president bill the story got no more traction than did the news that malik obama the presidents shunned halfbrother is supporting trump he too got a debate invitation to sit in the box presumably marked shame 
also in the dustbin of history are the allegations that flowers aborted bills baby in  and the whispering campaign a great political standby when proof is elusive that chelsea is the product of an affair between hillary and her then law firm colleague webb hubbell 
the williams and hubbell stories come with some convincing internet similarities at least in the photographs although in both cases politically this rumor milling whiplashed against trump as voters have only equated such tawdry allegations with his birther past something that has stuck as campaign mud    
technically birtherism doest directly involve sex although it lingers on its fringes as it speaks to barack obamas illegitimacy his foreign allegiances and possibly disputed paternity including the claim that frank marshall davis was actually obamas biological father another subterranean creed of trumpism 
again the documentary proof is a series of lookalike photographs as close as the internet gets to dna that davis was an american communist works well in the campaign as it suggests the origins of obamas political genetic code 
ironically for all his efforts at smear trump came out the loser in the debates when hillary nailed him to birtherism which has become a convenient code word for trumps racism misogyny and intolerance of immigrants especially muslims 
nor in response did trump have any luck in linking the birther movement to clintons  campaign when according to donald consiglierejournalist sidney blumenthal delighted in the suggestion that barack was born in kenya 
instead the debate claim only made trump look disingenuous clinton got a pass on what her campaign may or may not have insinuated in  and at this point no one cares but voters do remember trump as the imperial wizard of birtherism    
republicans can only blame themselves for wanting to divide the electorate in  along lines of sexual preference or deviance although this strategy was based on hillary being the democratic nominee and anyone other than trump standing for the republicans 
had the gop nominee been carly fiorina jeb bush or john kasich clinton inc might well have been vulnerable to possible storylines about infidelity illegitimacy and rape cue up the paula jones description of bill during a business meeting exposing himself in a little rock hotel and settling her lawsuit for  
instead the republicans went with the polyamorous trump who in addition to three marriages has bragged on morning radio about his success with young women and who since  has been leering at miss universe contestantsa bit like austin powers  shall we shag now or shall we shag later  
with trumps resumé of creepy perversion you might have thought that the republicans would drop sexual misconduct from the electoral playbook instead they doubled down to make the case that both clintons if elected would turn the white house into a strip club 
not only did the clintons shrug off such innuendo but in response they said in effect if they did it would be to cater to the likes of players such as donald j trump leisure suit and open collar optional    
for the momentand i cant see anything changing in the last days of the campaignthe accepted wisdom of most front pages is that donald trump has groped as many women as tiger woods has watched pole dancing in vegas even the gallery of their women looks about the same 
conversely few voters seem to care that bill might have forced himself on several women or that hillary helped to cover up his brutality thats a narrative of the s which is perhaps the last time austin danger trump read the newspaper  ive been frozen for  years ive got to see if my bits and pieces are still working  
for most voters in  names such as kathleen willey or juanita broaddrick are as lost in time as nan britton who just before the  election bore a love child with then candidate senator warren harding 
britton and the child got republican hush money and a sad little house in asbury park new jersey after harding won she was invited to the white house but their affair so to speak was kept in the closet    
if you think about elections as political sitcoms in  the kennedys had to run as rob and laura petrie on the dick van dyke show  complete with twin beds long flannel pajamas and prudent kisses on the cheek to say goodnight even if the jfk reality show would make trump bill clinton and tiger look like apprentices at adultery 
come  only something that resembles modern family and a desperatehousewives reality show can crack network primetime and who better to put on air than the clintons with their dallas like money communal sexuality and more illicit storylines than csi  
for more than twenty years bill and hillary have been bringing us seasons of lust affairs ididnothavesexwiththatwoman vince foster travelgate foundation slush funds basement servers commodity trading whitewater bosnian snipers paytoplay benghazi lost emails and the like and the ratings only continue to go up 
sure the apprentice was fun for a few episodes but the sameness of insulting young people grew tedious how is that supposed to compete with bill making a pass at huma while her husband goes to prison for airing his junk and chelsea finding out about her real father next on the clintons",2016-11-16

this fall the us agreed to provide  billion in military aid to israel over the next ten years ensuring americas continued role in funding the occupation of palestine meanwhile my friends and colleagues here in gaza live in fear of another significant israeli attack in the near future 
they have every reason to fear another major escalation  violence is a daily reality in gaza in two recent incidents a rocket was fired from gaza into israel without causing damage or injuries and in both instances israel responded by bombing targets throughout gaza 
in august alone israel bombed more than  locations in the small territory  
the simple story told about these events focuses on action and reaction palestinians attacked israel with a rocket and israel responded we hear this logic after nearly every event of this sort but its woefully incomplete 
in both instances the rockets fired werent fired by hamas but rather by small radical armed groups at odds with hamas which governs gaza these groups seek to incite israeli attacks on hamas with the goal of destabilizing its control over gaza because they see hamas as too comfortable with the status quo 
since seizing power in  hamas has worked to control and limit violence from the territory outside of periods of defined military escalation  which tend to be precipitated by israeli attacks  they have effectively stopped attacks against israel from gaza 
this explains why as noted by the israeli press there were only  rockets fired from gaza towards israel between january and august this year none were fired by hamas so israels decision to target hamas as a response makes no sense 
of course  rockets fired from gaza is  too many for those of us committed to ending all violence and none of this should be taken as an apology for other violence perpetrated by hamas 
but as the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in the occupied palestinian territories reports  there were also  israeli military incursions into gaza this year resulting in  palestinian deaths and on average injuring five palestinians in gaza every week 
this is the part of the story that isnt told 
gaza also remains under an israeliimposed blockade that severely limits travel trade and life for gazans despite assurances that restrictions would be lifted in the  hamasisrael ceasefire agreement the blockade remains in effect 
israel with support from the us government claims this decadeslong blockade is in place to pressure the people of gaza to rise up against hamas and provide security for israelis 
if those are israels raisons detre then its a complete failure it hasnt stopped violence it hasnt weakened hamas and it hasnt brought israelis or palestinians security 
while the blockade hasnt succeeded in achieving the changes israel claims to be seeking its impact on the civilian population of gaza has been immense 
over two years after the end of the last large military operation there much of gaza remains in ruins 
of the  palestinians in gaza who were displaced during the  israeli bombardment over  remain homeless as  percent of the homes seriously damaged or destroyed havent been rebuilt this is largely because reconstruction materials remain blocked from entering gaza 
this important context is too often missing as us pundits and politicians consider the situation in gaza 
given the blockade and regular military incursions imposed by israel the firing of less than  rockets per month by palestinians cannot be seen as the core reason for violence 
if the us is serious about promoting peace between israelis and palestinians preventing future violence in gaza and guaranteeing security then it must recognize the violence inherent in the israeli occupation and end the blockade

it was fiftyfour years or so when a classmate at bard college insisted that i read a short story by isaac babel titled the reserve cavalry commander that he described to me as a cossack soldier miraculously bringing a moribund horse to its feet the red cavalry the title of babels collection of short stories written when the jew and former menshevik was imbedded with prorevolution cossacks had been confiscating peasant horses during the civil war and trading in nags ridden to exhaustion on the battlefield for fresh ones 
for the backward peasants this was the sort of intrusion that would become the straw that broke the camels back in about a decade being forced into collective farms like recalcitrant horses drove them into open revolt for the time being however they were inclined to tolerate the communists who at least had come to power on the promise of peace bread and land it was the assault on the gentrys land that for the time being assuaged the peasants 
responding to an aggrieved muzhik peasant dyakov the eponymous reserve cavalry commander who was a former circus rider described by babel as redfaced with a gray mustache a black cape and wide red tatar trousers with silver stripes promised that he could make this lively little mare spring to her feet again the idea that the horse splayed out on the ground could be described as lively was almost an insult the muzhik cried out lord in heaven and mother of god how is this poor thing supposed to get up its on its last legs 
dyakovs ability to bring the horse back on its feet was like jesus raising lazarus from the dead but all the more miraculous since it likely occurred most of babels short stories were based on his experience as a war correspondent he wrote 
you are insulting this horse my dear fellow dyakov answered with fierce conviction pure blasphemy my dear fellow and he deftly swung his athletes body out of his saddle splendid and deft as if in the circus ring he stretched his magnificent legs his trousers girded by cords around the knees and walked up to the dying animal she peered at him dolefully with a severe penetrating eye licked some invisible command from his crimson palm and immediately the feeble mare felt bracing power flow from this sprightly gray blossoming romeo her muzzle lolling her legs skidding under her feeling the whip tickling her stomach with imperious impatience the mare slowly and deliberatey rose onto her legs and then we all saw dyakovs slender hand with its fluttering sleeve run through her dirty mane and his whining whip swatting her bleeding ranks her whole body shivering the mare stood on four legs without moving her timid doglike lovestruck eyes from dyakov 
so you seethis is a horse dyakov said to the muzhik  and added softly and you were complaining my dearest of friends 
throwing his reins to his orderly the commander of the reserve cavalry jumped the four stairs in a single leap and swirling off his operatic cloak disappeared into the headquarters 
today reading this story once again for the first time in fiftyfour years i am reminded of how important babel was to me at the time like ezra pound james joyce and thomas mann he was a portal into the world of modernist literature that still had an immense attraction for young bohemians in the early s i never thought once about who babel was or anything about the social reality he was trying to depict all that mattered to me was babels prose that could evoke the mysterious power of a cossack resurrecting a dying horse 
my early connections to modernism and my later connections to marxism that superseded it and just about all the other intellectual baggage i carried around with me from the early s converged as i watched a press screening of finding babel that opens on october  th at the cinema village in new york directed by david novack who has a background as a sound engineer it is a film that will be of great interest to those whose appreciation of babel is strictly literary as was mine long ago and to those trying to come to terms with the soviet legacy given the prominence of ukraine today as a possible trigger of wwiii according to some babels multiple identity as jew ukrainian communist and critic of soviet deficiencies is worth pondering 
the film is structured around the odyssey conducted by andrei malaevbabel who is the grandson of isaac babel and an acting professor in the theater department of the new college of florida to see where his grandfather lived and to speak with people who knew him or who have studied or been inspired by his work isaac babel was executed for treason in  having been charged with belonging to a trotskyist group and spying for france and austria babels wife antonina pirozhkova who died at the age of  in  is interviewed in the film and provides much of the information about babels personality and his travails as a dissident after her husbands arrest in  the soviet cops told her to forget about him and to regulate her life according to the new york times obituary she was formidable in her own right with her engineering degree she helped to design the moscow subway system the obit notes 
ms pirozhkova recalled babels dismay at her haphazard reading habits which he tried to correct by drawing up a list of the hundred books that every educated person needs to read it included a volume titled the instincts and morals of insects she recounted evenings spent with soviet cultural giants like the film director sergei m eisenstein and visits by foreign luminaries like andré gide and andré malraux 
it was babels mistake apparently to adhere to the values of the original russian revolution rather than to fall in line as a stalin toady 
as he travels around ukraine malaevbabel encounters intellectuals and ordinary people who revere babel as one of their own especially for odessa tales another collection of short stories that is as highly regarded as red cavalry written in  and  the stories focus on jewish gangsters living in moldavanka an odessa slum hardly the material youd expect to find written by a partisan of the russian revolution but certainly in keeping with the original inspiration of soviet culture that conformed to terences observation  homo sum humani nihil a me alienum puto  or i am human and nothing of that which is human is alien to me 
although i have never read odessa tales i plan to as soon as i find the time since it is about the same sort of characters my grandfather louis proyect probably knew in byelorussia and who like him escaped pogroms by emigrating to the usa unlike my grandfather who made a life out of building hotels in sullivan county in upstate ny abe kid twist reles and other members of murder incorporated only saw the borscht belt as a place where they could dump their victims in swan lake about fifteen minutes from my home town 
throughout the film we hear brief excerpts from both collections narrated by liev schreiber that will be a good introduction to babels literary power there are also interviews with some leading babel scholars including stanford professor gregory freidin who spent a day traveling around paris with malaevbabel to see places where babel lived for a few years before returning to russia we learn that although he could have avoided becoming one of stalins countless victims by living in exile he was too attached to russian culture and language to live abroad 
while in paris babel wrote a play titled maria that likely put him on stalins shitlist although being a freethinking intellectual and artist might have condemned from the start with his theater background malaevbabel is ideally suited to discuss the play with fellow thespians including marina vlady an acclaimed russianfrench actress who reads a letter from the titular character 
in  gregory freidin mounted a production of maria at stanford university the plays program describes major character isaac dymshit a jewish gangster as a symbol of capitalist rationality while the eponymous maria epitomized the pure romance of the revolution she like the young babel served in the red cavalry 
never seen on stage we only hear from maria indirectly as her letter is recited by another character in scene five it begins 
at dawn the bugle from squadron headquarters wakes me by eight i have to be in the political propaganda division im in charge therei edit the articles of the divisional newspaper i run the literacy classes our reinforcements are all ukrainians they remind me of italians the way they talk and act russia has been suppressing and destroying their culture for centuries in our house in petersburg opposite the hermitage and the winter palace we might as well have been living in polynesia for we knew any thing at all about our people 
it is writing lines like this that got babel killed rather than spying for france or austria 
babel was a friend and protégé of maxim gorky who remained a diehard stalinist despite sharing babels inclination for writing about the lower depths of russian society he was deeply troubled by how maria depicted political corruption prosecution of the innocent and black marketeering within soviet society gorky accused babel of having a baudelairean predilection for rotting meat apparently gorky had forgotten that baudelaire was marxs favorite novelist 
david novack the director of finding babel has a connection to odessa but not to its legendary jewish gangsters he has an ancestor named david nowakowsky who wrote liturgical music for a synagogue there 
in an interview given to the odessa review  novack sums up isaac babels relationship to the soviet experience that resonates with my own on the left as someone with roots in the existential outsider world of the s that saw albert camus as its most eloquent spokesmen i never found myself comfortable with the trotskyist milieu that fostered cultish obedience to the genius leader to this day it has been these youthful affinities with outsider culture that makes it difficult for me to join any amen chorus on the left even though it is the left that remains my homeland i think that novacks description of babels insideroutsider sensibility can help me preserve my sanity in a period of deep contradictions within the left 
babel represented the insider outsider thats what he was he got himself all the way inside up to the upper levels of the nkvd up to beria who ended up supervising his torture in the end personally i dont know if he was in the room but he had an office in the st catharines monastery where babel was tortured that monastery was being used as a torture prison the sukhanovo prison which we note in the film we visited it he got himself as close to the flame as possible as an insider but yet he was an outsider because he was from odessa he was jewish he should not even have been permitted to study under gorky which is where he really honed his skills the only reason that he was able to study under gorky is that he smuggled himself illegally to st petersburg when he wasnt allowed to be there because it was outside the settlement area for jews so babel was an outsider he then found himself with red calvary with the cossacks in the red army running through western ukraine as he documented brutality against the ukrainians and the jews brutality brought on by both sides it was a civil war essentially between the reds and the poles who suffered the most the jews and the ukrainians the peasantry are the ones who suffered the most in that conflict there he was again the outsider insider its from this very unique perspective where all his writing came from",2016-10-27

670,swedish mp quits in disgust at jewish ownership of media  includes short video by red ice radio,"by m jaggers ld we discussed yesterday the various reasons why trump won the election mr jaggers thinks trump won because he promoted the interests of the vast underclass of disenfranchised whites who were sick to death of the neoconservative liberal elites as typified by the loathsome hillary clinton it is in trumps own interests jaggers believes not to betray the whites who voted for him by reneging on his promises there must be no uturns no cuddling up to the zionist enemy no wishywashy compromises or backslidings trump is now expected to make america great again  or else a tall order well see ld 
 in certain times there is a surreal feeling of being a part of history which is perhaps to say we are living in a time period of dynamic change however unthinkable for the left it may be trump has been elected we can add this to brexit and other unthinkable events to come to contemplate the details of what this may entail such as the selection of cabinet members and policy priorities  which do indeed include building that wall has something of a christmas morning feelingeveryday 
to paraphrase an from die welt  in western democracies the status quo seems stable and it is not generally considered possible for extremes to transpire but that is what we have seen however we may want to quibble about what exactly is extreme can donald trump or the altright for that matter be considered extreme after that electoral show of consent regardless when there is an endless back and forth between stultifying uncourageous republicans and the frankly antiwhite agenda of the democrats extreme does not carry such a negative connotation but instead implies a kind of deliverance 
we have been locked in a middleclass complaisance and that is precisely why societies such as ours are often surprised by the foreseeable and obvious and alas though it may be unspeakable to liberals and though he was the object of such ridicule in our media trump is now the most powerful man in the world as die welt puts it perhaps with some apprehension just let that sink in explanatory factors 
trumps appeal may have been equally a reaction to black lives matter protests as to immigration according to exit polls  percent of trump voters feel that blacks are treated fairly by the criminal justice system which by definition means that these voters are not sympathetic to black lives matter overall half of white voters democrats and republicans opined that blacks are treated fairly by police likely most of us will have anecdotal evidence that our nonaltright family members and acquaintances were not amused by black lives matter trump voters were especially unamused 
of trump supporters  percent favor building the wall on the southern border compared to less than half of all voters  percent oppose  percent favor so antipathy towards both black lives matter and immigration can be said to have catapulted trump to the presidency  in part by turning off mainstream middleclass white people who are normally content with the statusquo moderates may not want a wall per se  but they also may not complain too loudly when its being built and again trumps actual voters want it builtunequivocally 
while losing some steam amongst collegeeducated whites trump won the white working class by  points  an increase from romneys  point spread ultimately there is no simple narrative that emerges trump increased white support in different key swing states from different rural and suburban demographics in order to dominate the electoral college i wont pretend to be nate silver so lets just say he won because of white people 
among his supporters opines thomas friedman on real time with bill maher  this was  percent about race and the other  percent was about race 
good then lets accept the premise of liberals and draw the necessary conclusions if trump triumphed on the basis of race issues he now has a mandate on immigration law and order the wall etc 
for the nytimes david brooks holding forth on public broadcasting service pbs trump voters are just going with their gene pool  a rather bald statement that trump voters are voting their ethnic interests after the election brooks predicted that the country would be split into two factions with one faction advocating ethnic separatism what many on the alt right are already advocating would that it were so 
nixon became known to history as the law and order candidate which accurately characterized his proclivities visàvis crime trump on the other hand to leave no doubt selfidentified as the law and order candidate as liberals will complain and as the altright will readily admit law and order is understood to mean that we will not tolerate black violence and civil unrest trumps support therefore was premised on his intolerance for the very violence which his election has provoked once again from blacks and other malcontent minorities in the protests following his victory which continue as i write this 
it is ironic that blacks report feeling scared at the prospect of the trump presidency while they are in fact the progenitors of violence and so far as i know trump never made any negative statements explicitly about blacks their violence and disorder has indeed scared the rest of civil society contributing to trumps election perhaps blacks are expressing their fear by attacking innocent whites in this inverted reality how can we assuage these sensitive blacks sense of fear shall we become human punching bags you cant always get what you want 
if there is one thing that minorities have learned over the last eight years it is that they get what they want and whites perhaps as a natural corollary do not hence the indignation following this surprise victory 
some journalists noted with amusement that trump often played the rolling stones you cant always get what you want at his campaign rallies i hypothesized that trump liked the song for its beautiful choral section which has a celestial quality that built anticipation for his arrival on stage surely he paid little heed to the message of the lyrics which discordantly seemed to suggest he was voters second choice but now it all makes sense i suggest that for our underprivileged people of color its time you learned you cant always get what you want 
not only is the people of color poc attitude of entitlement and aggrievement ridiculous it is also presumptuous 
while the msm claims that the onus is now on trump to reach out to those who didnt vote for him ie blacks and hispanics it would seem that he was given a mandate to serve the interests of those who did vote for him  it follows logically that he would now carry that project through and enact the policies which mobilized his base and put him in the oval office sourced from the occidental observer like this share it now  thoughts on  trump won because of white people  györgy says november   at  am 
you cant always get what you want 
if there is one thing that minorities have learned over the last eight years it is that they get what they want and whites perhaps as a natural corollary do not hence the indignation following this surprise victory 
problem has been favouring certain ethnic groups beyond reasonability people are people for example employment should go to the best qualified candidate regardless of race or ethnic creed an assumption is made on the governments part that an employer will unfairly select anglo saxon over other races which is wrong therefore the employer must use race based quota agendas to effect equality 
this is a form of dictating morality by an amoral government this is one area that mr trump ought to behove",2016-10-27
671,christ and the sufi  a parable of perfection,"part   the six stages of the exorcism process by lobro van helsing part  of this article is authored entirely by lobro van helsing and consists largely of graphic details about the exorcism process as described by malachi martin in his controversial book hostage to the devil  part  of the article entitled the deceiver of the world is by lasha darkmoon and continues where part  leaves off this reflects on various apocalyptic issues such as armageddon and the last days the problem of good and evil and the role of the jews in human history 
the devils finest trick is to persuade you that he does not exist  charles baudelaire 
why is it so hard to accept at least hypothetically that in the words of observant thinkers like baudelaire the devils finest trick is to convince us that he does not exist 
it is generally accepted that the devil preys on human souls and what do predators do in all the settings natural political online they all use disguise and it shouldnt be beyond comprehension that the devil if he existed would use whichever cloak of invisibility was the most effective for the occasion therefore not seeing the devil or sensing his presence proves absolutely nothing 
for those who are interested the material here comes from a book hostage to the devil  by father malachi martin a trained exorcist in the roman catholic tradition 
fr malachis material featuring several cases of authentic demonic possession and their accompanying exorcisms in modern day america was carefully vetted through use of tape recorders and reinforced later on by lengthy interviews with the participants in the exorcism process    
in  in south africa  clara germana cele age  reportedly made a pact with the devil as a result her behavior suddenly took a bizarre turn for the worse in august of that year the startled nuns at the convent school where clara was a student witnessed her tearing at her clothes growling like an animal and engaging in conversation with unseen entities 
nuns reported that the girls skin would burn when sprinkled with holy water she would lash out violently when crosses or other sacred objects entered her presenceshe also reportedly developed clairvoyant powers and was able to describe personal details of other peoples lives that she couldnt possibly have known ab out 
the accounts of several nuns also reported that clara possessed the ability to speak and understand several different foreign languages to which she had never been exposed including polish german french and several others it was said that clara had been imbued with superhuman strength as well easily overpowering authority figures at the school when they attempted to restrain her 
another seemingly farfetched assertion from many witnesses was that clara began levitating up to five feet in the air on a regular basis her clothes sticking to her body as if they too had managed to defy the laws of gravity it was claimed that only after being sprinkled with holy water could she be brought back down during which time she would also temporarily snap out of her possessed state 
most outlandish of all were the claims that the young woman had the ability to transform into a sort of snakelike creature her body becoming as flexible as rubber as she slithered across the floor at one point she was said to have bitten a nun on the arm and left puncture marks like those of a serpents fangs 
see here  
note this case history is not to be found in malachi martins hostage to the devil i have added it to the article as an afterthought since it contains within it many of the typical features found in demonic possession before you read any further please watch this minute video in spanish with english subtitles warning this article contains material that is deeply disturbing those of sensitive disposition are advised to refrain from further reading 
apart from the quoted extracts randomly chosen among many to illustrate various aspect of possession or exorcism i wish to make the following points although the book deals only with cases in the catholic community demonic possession is a universal phenomenon and has been noted and researched in countries all over the world the possessor often referring to itself as the kingdom or in plural as we selects victims gripped in some spiritual emotional and intellectual conflict with the accepted mores of family society and church inserting itself undetected into these fault lines and exploiting them with catastrophic consequences loss of self identity soul or personality follows as a result there is invariably an element of guilt on the part of the victim who has initially invited possession by his or her aberrant behavior and life style in extreme cases the possessed individual has actually made a formal request for possession in order to gain some advantage eg worldly wealth or fame the process of expelling the possessing malignancy moves through identifiable stages 
one of the most experienced exorcists i have known malachi martin notes who was in fact the mentor of the exorcist in the first case related in this book gave names to the various general stages of an exorcism these names reflect the general meaning or effect or intent of what is happening but not the specific means used by the evil spirit or by the exorcist conor as i call him spoke of six stages presence pretense breakpoint voice clash and expulsion  exorcism exacts practically intolerable toll on the priest in charge not infrequently resulting in his death at which point the junior helper must take over the task demonic possession is not an isolated or freak phenomenon it seems to be on the rise especially in the united states perhaps this has something to do with the demise of religious authority the proliferation of satanist covens child abuse and sacrifice the prevalence and glorification of satanist elements in pop culture and finally the wide acceptance and promotion of sexual perversion as a new norm 
the incidence of exorcism fr martin begins by pointing out has been on a steady rise there has been a  percent increase in the number of exorcisms performed between the early s and the mids over the same period there has been an alarming increase in the number of requested possessions  that is cases in which the possessed formally request satan to possess them  in comparison to the cases of incurred possessions which result from other sorts of activities of the possessed that facilitate possession 
each year some  to  major exorcisms and some thousands of minor exorcisms are performed for experts in the field this is a sobering barometer of the increase in known cases of possession but it is still more sobering to realize how many more cases of possession cannot be addressed at all the thousands of letters i receive from people who are desperate for help  catholic protestant evangelical and unchurched  are eloquent anguished and a steadily mounting testimony to the crisis 
law officers meanwhile are increasingly confronted on every side by the incontrovertible signs of crimes committed in the course of ritualistic satanism or as a grisly result of an individuals participation in such rituals they are very often left out of the shrunken loop of expert advice and assistance advice and assistance that was once routinely to be found 
to those who are active in the field of exorcism and who therefore acquire a greater than usual ability to uncover and recognize the marks of ritualistic satanism for what they are it is clear that in many police precincts the satanist character of a crime is either relegated to the background or not mentioned at all  at least not in public reports 
by and large the police have no other choice they have neither competence nor authority in the rarefied and dangerous field of satanist behavior most of the above points were made on numerous occasions in mythology and folklore eg vampires werewolves and the tale of dr faustus adapted by marlowe and goethe jesus christ was of course the grand exorcist not only in the gadarene swine incident but his opus seems to me to have been focused on confronting the devil in judaism for which he paid with his life  the tale does not end there in my view but i leave these speculative elements to the reader    the six stages of demonic possession 
from the moment the exorcist enters the room a peculiar feeling seems to hang in the very air from that moment in any genuine exorcism and onward through its duration everyone in the room is aware of some alien presence  this indubitable sign of possession is as unexplainable and unmistakable as it is inescapable all the signs of possession however blatant or grotesque however subtle or debatable seem both to pale before and to be marshaled in the face of this presence 
there is no sure physical trace of the presence but everyone feels it you have to experience it to know it you cannot locate it spatially beside or above or within the possessed or over in the corner or under the bed or hovering in midair 
in one sense the presence is nowhere and this magnifies the terror because there is a presence an other present not a he or a she or an it sometimes you think that what is present is singular sometimes plural when it speaks as the exorcism goes on it will sometimes refer to itself as i and sometimes as we 
this is reminiscent of the possessing entity in the gospel who when asked his name by jesus replied i am legion i am legion 
invisible and intangible the presence claws at the humanness of those gathered in the room you can exercise logic and expel any mental image of it you can say to yourself i am only imagining this careful dont panic and there may be a momentary relief but then after a time lag of bare seconds the presence returns as an inaudible hiss in the brain as a wordless threat to the self you are its name and essence seem to be compounded of threat to be only and intensely baleful concentratedly intent on hate for hates sake and on destruction for destructions sake    
in the early stages of an exorcism  the evil spirit will make every attempt to hide behind the possessed so to speakto appear to be one and the same person and personality with its victim this is the pretense  
the first task of the priest is to break that pretense to force the spirit to reveal itself openly as separate from the possessedand to name itself for all possessing spirits are called by a name that generally though not always has to do with the way that spirit works on its victim 
as the exorcist sets about his task the evil spirit may remain silent altogether or it may speak with the voice of the possessed and use past experiences and recollections of the possessed this is often done skillfully using details no one but the possessed could know it can be very disarming even pitiful it can make everyone including the priest feel that it is the priest who is the villain subjecting an innocent person to terrible rigors even the mannerisms and characteristics of the possessed are used by the spirit as its own camouflage 
sometimes the exorcist cannot shatter the pretense for days but until he does he cannot bring matters to a head if he fails to shatter it at all he has lost perhaps another exorcist replacing him will succeed but he himself has been beaten every exorcist learns during pretense that he is dealing with some force or power that is at times intensely cunning sometimes supremely intelligent and at other times capable of crass stupidity which makes one wonder further about the problem of singular or plural and it is both highly dangerous and terribly vulnerable 
oddly while this spirit or power or force knows some of the most secret and intimate details of the lives of everyone in the room at the same time it also displays gaps in knowledge of things that may be happening at any given moment of the present 
but the priest must not be lulled by small victories or take chances on hopedfor stupidities he must be ready to have his own sins and blunders and weaknesses put into his mind or shouted in ugliness for all to hear he must not make excuses for his past or wither as even his loveliest memories are fingered by ultimate filth and contempt he must not be sidetracked in any way from his primary intention of freeing the possessed person before him and he must at all costs avoid trading abuse or getting into any logical arguments with the possessed the temptation to do so is more frequent than one might think and must be regarded as a potentially fatal trap that can shatter not only the exorcism but quite literally shatter the exorcist as well 
accordingly as the pretense begins to break down the behavior of the possessed usually increases in violence and repulsiveness it is as though an invisible manhole opens and out of it pours the unmentionably inhuman and the humanly unacceptable there is a stream of filth and unrestrained abuse accompanied often by physical violence writhing gnashing of teeth jumping around sometimes physical attacks on the exorcist    
a new hallmark of the proceedings enters as the breakpoint nears and ushers in one of the more subtle sufferings the exorcist must undergo confusion complete and dreadful confusion rare is the exorcist who does not falter here for at least a moment enmeshed in the peculiar pain of apparent contradiction of all sense 
his ears seem to smell foul words his eyes seem to hear offensive sounds and obscene screams his nose seems to taste a highdecibel cacophony each sense seems to be recording what another sense should be recording each nerve and sinew of onlookers and participants becomes rigid as they strive for control panicthe fear of being dissolved into insanityruns in quick jabs through everyone there all present experience this increasingly violent and confusing assault but the exorcist is the one who rides the storm he is the direct target of it all 
the breakpoint is reached at that moment when the pretense has finally collapsed altogether the voice of the possessed is no longer used by the spirit though the new strange voice may or may not issue from the mouth of the victim in thomas wus case the alien voice did come from the possesseds mouth and that was why the police captain was so startled the sound produced is often not even remotely like any human sound 
at the breakpoint for the first time the spirit speaks of the possessed in the third person as a separate being for the first time the possessing spirit acts personally and speaks of i or we usually interchangeably and of my and our or mine and ours 
another very frequent sign that the breakpoint has been reached is the appearance of what father conor called the voice  
the voice is an inordinately disturbing and humanly distressing babel the first few syllables seem to be those of some word pronounced slowly and thicklysomewhat like a tape recording played at a subnormal speed you are just straining to pick up the word and a layer of cold fear has already gripped youyou know this sound is alien but your concentration is shattered and frustrated by an immediate gamut of echoes of tiny prickly voices echoing each syllable screaming it whispering it laughing it sneering it groaning it following it they all hit your ear while the alien voice is going on unhurriedly to the next syllable which you then try to catch while guessing at the first one you lost by then the tiny jabbing voices have caught up with that second syllable and the voice has proceeded to the third syllable and so on 
if the exorcism is to proceed the voice must be silenced it takes an enormous effort of will on the part of the exorcist in direct confrontation with the alien will of evil to silence the voice the priest must get himself under control and challenge the spirit first to silence and then to identify itself intelligibly 
as in all things to do with exorcism of evil spirit the priest makes this challenge with his own will but always in the name and by the authority of jesus and his church to do so in his own name or by some fancied authority of his own would be to invite personal disaster merely human power unadorned and without aid cannot cope with the preternatural it is to be remembered that when we speak of the preternatural we are not speaking about what are known as poltergeists 
usually at this point and as the voice dies out a tremendous pressure of an obscure kind affects the exorcist this is the first and outermost edge of a direct and personal collision with the will of the kingdom the clash  
we all know from our personal experience that there can be no struggle of single personal wills without that felt and intuitive contact between two persons there is a twoway communication that is as real as a conversation using words the clash is the heart of a special and dreadful communication the nucleus of this singular battle of wills between exorcist and evil spirit    
painful as it will be for him the priest must look for the clash he must provoke it if he cannot lock wills with the evil thing and force that thing to lock its will in opposition to his own then again the exorcist is defeated 
the issue between the two the exorcist and the possessing spirit is simple will the totally antihuman invade and take over will it noisome and merciless seep over that narrow rim where the exorcist would hold his ground alone and engulf him or will it unwillingly protestingly under a duress greater than its singletrack will stop identify itself cede retire disappear and be volatilized back into an unknown pit of being where no man wants to go ever 
even with all the pressure on him and in fullest human agony if the exorcist has got this far he must press home he has gained an advantage he has already forced the evil spirit to come out on its own if he has not been able to until now he must finally force it to give its name and then some exorcists feel the exorcist must pursue for as much information as he can for in some peculiar way as exorcists find the more an evil spirit can be forced to reveal in the clash and its aftermath the surer and easier will be the expulsion when that moment comes to force as complete an identification as possible is perhaps a mark of domination of one will over another 
it is of crucial interest to speculate about the violence provoked by exorcismthe physical and mental struggles that are so extreme they can bring on death why would spirit battle so why not leave and waft off invisibly to someone or someplace else for spirit itself seems to suffer in these battles 
time and again in exorcism after exorcism there occurs that curious thing to do with spirit and place the strange puzzle mentioned previously in connection with the room chosen for the exorcism when jesus expelled the unclean spirits those spirits showed concern for where they might go in record after record as well as in several exorcisms recounted in this book the possessing spirits wail in lament and questioning pain where shall we gowe too have to possess our habitationeven the anointed one gave us a place with the swinehere    we cant stay here any longer 
evil spirit having found a home with a consenting host does not appear to give up its place easily it claws and fights and deceives and even risks killing its host before it will be expelled how violent the struggle probably depends on many things the intelligence of the spirit being dealt with and the degree of possession achieved over the victim are perhaps two one could speculate about 
whatever determines the actual pitch of violence once the exorcist has forced the invading spirit to identify itself and sustained the first wordless bout of the clash and then invoked its formal condemnation and expulsion by the exorcism rite the immediate result is generally a struggle tortuous beyondimagining an open violence that leaves all subtlety behind 
the person possessed is by now obviously aware in one way or another of what possessed him frequently he becomes a true battleground for much of the remainder of the exorcism enduring unbelievable punishment and strain 
it is sometimes possible for the exorcist to appeal directly to the possessed person urging him to use some part of his own will still free of the spirits influence and control and engage directly in the fight aiding the exorcist and at such moments no animal pinned helplessly to the ground struggles more pathetically against the drinking of its lifes blood by a voracious and superior cruelty the very nauseous character of the possessed persons appearance and behavior appears to be a sign of his desire for deliverance a desperate sign of struggle evidence of a revolt where once he had consented 
increasingly what had possessed him is being forced into the open all the while protesting its victims revolt and its own expulsion the violence of the contortions and the physical disfigurement of the possessed can reach a degree one would think he could not possibly withstand 
the exorcist too comes in for full attack now once cornered the evil spirit seems able to call on a superior intelligence and will try to lure the exorcist on to a field boobytrapped and mined with situations from which no human can extricate himself 
any weakness in the religious faith that alone sustains the exorcist or any fatigue will allow the exorcists mind to be flooded with a terrible light he cannot fend offa light that can burn the very roots of his reason and turn him emotionally into the most servile of slaves desperate to be liberated from all bodily life 
these are only some of the dangers and traps that face every exorcist his pain is physical emotional mental he has to deal with what is eerie but not enthralling with something askew but intelligently so with a quality that is upside down and inside out but significantly so the mordant traits of nightmare are there in full regalia but this is no dream and permits him no thankful remission 
he is attacked by a stench so powerful that many exorcists start vomiting uncontrollably he is made to bear physical pain and he feels anguish over his very soul he is made to know he is touching the completely unclean the totally unhuman  the totally unhuman  click to expand  
all sense may suddenly seem nonsense hopelessness is confirmed as the only hope death and cruelty and contempt are normal anything comely or beautiful is an illusion nothing it seems was ever right in the world of man here is an atmosphere as bizarre as bedlam 
if in spite of his emotions and his imagination and his bodyall trapped at once in pain and anguishif in spite of all this the will of the exorcist holds in the clash what he does is to approach his final function in this situation as an authorized human witness for jesus 
by no power of his on account of no privilege of his own he calls finally on the evil spirit to desist to be dispossessed to depart  and to leave the person possessed 
and if the exorcism is successful this is what happens the possession ends 
all present become aware of a change around them the sense of presence is totally suddenly absent 
sometimes there are receding voices or other noises sometimes only dead silence 
the recently possessed will wake up as if from a dream a nightmare a coma sometimes he will remember much of what he has been through sometimes he will remember nothing at all    many people could be demonically possessed without knowing it here are two individuals who in my opinion might benefit from the ministrations of a good exorcist is this woman demonically possessed who knows    but many have said so click here for a spooky minute video is this woman demonically possessed who knows    but many have thought so apart from the demonic expression that disfigures her face this woman preaches white genocidethe total destruction of the european race what more do you have to do to qualify for demonic possession see here for more details on barbara spectres psychopathy and compare the expression on her face with figure  of this illustration from a medical textbook on demonic possession   as i wrote in a recent email to lasha darkmoon i feel that the entire tribe of judah is demonically possessed they always have been for centuries jesus made that point over and over again in his homilies and clearly the jews works bear that out they are now the devils agents on earth to promote his policies and spread contagion into the body of the goyim history bears me out on this 
i will not quote dr darkmoons response here it is too long and would require a separate article of its own suffice to say that she disagreed with me on several counts though she accepted my general premise that demonic possession was an authentic and veridical phenomenon and not just a superstitious relic of the dark ages continued in part  the deceiver of the world  by lasha darkmoon

672,hillary is finished  as the fbi reopens their case into her latest crimes video,"with a supplemantry note by lasha darkmoon on the transhumanist depopulation agenda we are now in a far worse condition than if hitlers clone were to become president on january   their plan is far worse than just cloning hitler and making him president and commander in chief the day of reckoning has arrived  vid rebel i never said i supported donald trump because i liked where he wanted us to go i did say i was interested in the anger of the bernie sanders and donald trump voters on election night a bbc reporter tried to explain how hillary lost that state which has a huge black vote and lots of technically advanced people from out of state in what americans call researchtriangle park obama went there in a last ditch effort to get out the vote he was popular there amongst the college students they had voted for him in  but not so much for hillary in  the bbc reporter told us the people who lived there said they were all bernie voters they had zero enthusiasm for hillary 
i previously quoted mike rivero who had said that if hillary clinton were running in november against godzilla the lizard would have his vote we have seen the hillary koolaid drinkers go crazy after donald won they all live in bubbles where it would have been career suicide to say you voted against hillarys pay for pay corruption 
i have seen a lot of domestic antitrump propaganda from the far right because donald is a zionist i agree with donald that we should stop funding isis and let vladimir putin take them down it was obama who armed isis and let a small band become an international menace overnight by allowing them to take mosul in  and refusing to let the usaf take them out on that highway from syria but i do disagree with donalds intention to confront iran for what resisting zionism 
but fortunately for iran what trump and americas rulers want will soon become irrelevant of course that is not good news for americans who blindly follow the people who think they own the government of the united states 
i have just now seen from europe sheer postelection idiocy some are claiming that donald trump is the puppet of the fourth reich and is backed by the same industrialists and money men that had elevated adolf hitler to the chancellorship in  
it is silly to think that the rockefellers and the rothschilds backed trump 
i do admit that america is run by a criminal elite i had written that catherine austin fitts said the us military and intelligence services had given donald a green light to dish out dirt on hillary these men were on the inside of the vile mechanism that runs america but even they thought hillary was one witch too far to go 
i have reported on the elite end game many times before their plan is far worse than just cloning hitler and making him president and commander in chief far worse 
the people who had owned the governments in the west until recently were the  families and their  minions that is according to david rothkopf the former ceo of kissinger associates and author of superclass 
fortunately for us the people of the us and europe are learning to resist 
i voted once in a presidential election where the democrat was a member of the trilateral commission headed by david rockefeller in north america and sir evelyn de rothschild in europe the republican was a member of the bilderberg society headed by sir evelyn de rothschild in europe and headed by david rockefeller in north america you never read that in our corporate media 
please do not call those people who run hollywood and our tv news nazis they are either jewish or work for jewish companiesthe direct ties of those who thought they were born to rule over us are more to banking than to industry they are not nazis    the transhumanist depopulation agenda ld  in a breakthrough interview on the transhumanist agenda and the  presidential election catherine austin fitts former us assistant housing secretary and publisher of the solari report spoke of the engineered rise of autism gmo proliferation the expansion of entrainment technology the rise of artificial intelligence and robotics and the dumbing down of american students with common core see here  these were all she argued part of an overarching conspiracy to promote a massive transhumanist depopulation agenda this would be achieved by an engineered economic armageddon leading to mass starvation food riots and race wars that would wipe billions of people off the face of the planet how soon this apocalyptic scenario is likely to unfold is anyones guess any moment now many doomsayers declare the coming of donald trump is regarded by many as an omen of the end days ld vid rebel continues 
catherine austin fitts said the bankers stole  trillion from us i think they stole a lot more 
the bankers gave themselves the right to charge us interest on money they created out of nothing in  when they founded the bank of england america copied the bank of england and the german central bank when they drafted the legislation for the federal reserve in  it became law in  just in time for america to create enough unpayable debt at interest to fund ww i 
the united states entered ww i because the elite did not want the allies to accept germanys offer to stop the fighting in  the elite wanted the war to last long enough to bankrupt britain and france to set up a jewish communist dictatorship in russia and to make palestine a british colony for the jews none of that benefited voters in europe or america and the bought and paid for media cannot understand why we despise both them and the  families that sent them 
we are now in a far worse condition than if hitlers clone were to become president on january   
the elite stole all of our pensions and savings they sold hundreds of trillions in bad bets otherwise known as credit default swaps just so they could pocket tens of trillions of dollars in premiums dont cry for them they made people like you ie taxpayers liable for the inevitable consequences for their actions just add another few hundred trillion dollars onto the pile of unpayable debts to be taken out of your pension fund your savings your bank account and your paycheck their malfeasance will become your obligation in the very near future at least that is what they are planning 
the bankers gave you a system in which you cannot have money unless you go into debt the federal reserve will not issue paper money until the treasury gives them a bond obligating us to pay them interest on money they created out of nothing you cannot have checking account money until someone takes out a loan and is willing to pay the bankers interest on money they created out of nothing 
if we had lincolns noninterest bearing greenbacks we would not have  trillion in national debt and be paying  billion a year in taxes to pay the resulting interest 
the recent sharp rise in the interest rate on  year treasury bonds means our financial system is near collapse 
a depression is a period in time when unpayable debts are cancelled en masse since we foolishly have a debt based system that means money vanishes every time a debt is discharged in foreclosure or in bankruptcy court it is this sudden sharp contraction in the money supply that creates all the unemployment 
i have quoted dr steve keen many times before we are headed to the worst financial crisis in the past five centuries because we have more unpayable debts to cancel than at any time in the past  years 
so what is worse than the fourth reich tens of millions of americans starving to death or killing their neighbors because they have nothing to eat 
in short a race war to end all wars 
of course this is what americas elite had planned for them they stole all of the pension funds and the savings they created the trade deals that closed  manufacturing plants and sent millions of jobs overseas they added  million people to the countrys population through legal and illegal immigration they papered over unemployment by using funny money to hire  million federal state and local workers making it appear like everyone was engaged in productive work they used funny money to give out unearned benefits to tens of million of people to minimize starvation until the day of reckoning 
the day of reckoning has arrived 
the  year treasury bonds interest rate at  is at record highs for recent years that means the crash and the nationwide food riots and the race wars will soon be upon us it was only zero interest rates that kept the ponzi scheme going this long 
the only exit path i see is for the us military to be asked to stop the food riots as soon as they begin to ravage the country 
and the junior officers in the military must respond by arresting bankers and seizing their assets to fund debt cancellation 
only debt cancellation will provide a painless way out of the coming financial collapse",2016-10-29

674,demonic possession today part,"according to john kaminski the new boss is the same as the old boss forget it if thats what you think kaminski says youre kidding yourself 
presidentelect donald trumps claim he is reinvestigating  is just so much meaningless hot air  more neocon crapola  if he intends to solve the greatest crime in american history by including two of the events participating perpetrators  rudy giuliani and lewis eisenberg  on his team of detectives 
what kind of truth can we expect from this kind of sandbagged scrutiny none at all once again our government is investigating itself with predictable results it will do no better than the first time  which was a total whitewash because it is the very system itself that all these political functionaries are trying to defend which bears responsibility for this event and its impact on history 
hiring the people who played minor supporting roles in the  bloodbath to identify its architects and actors may yield a few sacrificial scapegoats like cheney and some generals but the top of the line power structure will remain solidly in place hidden from view and utterly in control of world events 
that trump has surrounded himself with the tainted players who have carried out all these wars for israel augurs for a dark future in which the militarization of america will further shrink individual rights and the harsh crackdown on legitimate dissent  which will soon be banned  plainly signals the end of free speech as we have known it in the united states 
recall thomas jeffersons dictum freedom of the press cannot be limited without being lost today it is long gone the press prints only what the government allows it to print 
for trump to hire such rancid refugees from the bush administration means that he wont be investigating  instead he will be crafting a new more realistic coverup that lambastes saudi renegades and totally omits the overwhelming presence of israeli jews in all aspects of the tragedy  the same presence that now dominates the us government and its criminal activities throughout the world 
preemptive war is criminal activity in case you didnt know the us is practicing it everywhere under the cynical guise of fighting terror which it itself creates by hiring thugs from around the world to fit into the proper terror slots and become believable enemies for the press to vilify and our military to bomb 
the us has literally slaughtered millions of people around the world at the behest of a small group of mostly jewish men and the gentiles they have bought who control not only virtually all the money of the people in the world but also control their thoughts as a result 
mayor giuliani ran the command post in building  you remember building  that building that was knocked down by not being hit by an airplane giuliani knows everything that happened and who did what 
eisenberg one of the worlds foremost financiers was the head of the new york port authority who leased the twin towers to silverstein silverstein who spoke frequently with top israeli leaders wound up with  billion 
the question with regard to trumps integrity kind of splits down the middle since he seems to have a genuine desire to succeed and restore the peace but he is indebted to forces far larger than himself which he is now trying to placate by surrounding himself with the traditional pseudo republican goons like gingrich and romney 
if only they were genuine republicans it wouldnt be so bad but theyre poseurs all ultimately working for the rockefellers and the rothschilds 
business as usual in the jewish american empire gnawing on the fatted calf while   bleeds 
trumps choices reveal a desire to continue the swashbuckling sadism of the bush administration throughout his campaign i always shuddered when trump would proclaim that we needed a stronger military and i thought tell that to the people beneath the bombs because they want no part of any of this 
as a newspaper blows trivial events into earthshaking issues so politicians identify all manner of enemies that demonstrate the desperate need for them to be elected 
like the boston marathon bombing that turned a mercenary drill into a region wide suspension of freedom of movement the worst story possible is presented even as inconvenient facts are left behind 
think about the atrocities and false flag shockers that have been foisted on us since  statistics reveal that more than  of significant terror incidents began life as fbi sting operations manipulating low iq bigmouths into capital crimes 
why is it the cops can commit crimes against the people but the people cant commit crimes against the cops this is not the kind of freedom we thought wed get while growing up 
trump certainly is not addressing any of these issues and a trump administration will merely continue the clumsy depredations and smokescreen lies that have exemplified the utterly corrupt and criminal nature of the united states as it is run by jews bankers holed up in the city of london and wreaking havoc throughout the world by their control of everyones money 
what is really needed is a full accounting of what the jews have done to the united states and restitution to united states citizens over moneys illegally stolen by the federal reserve corporation to be taken from its stockholders immediately 
of course this is impossible because the jews own the government and all the corrupt minions within it one word from them and youre out of a job 
the avaricious jews are really only a reflection of the darker side of humanity like good sociopaths they learned everything they know by mimicking others and have become better than everyone else at what they do simply by practice and cooperation 
they have never once considered that the fate of the world ultimately depends on treating everyone in the world as members of your own family even as that becomes impossible on a continent overrun by hungry savages who were put there by these very same sadists who control the united states and its fearsome war machine

675,far worse than the fourth reich  the day of reckoning has arrived,"steve bannon donalds trumps chief strategist and senior counselor 
as a jew who has worked for years with steve bannon i can tell you he is not an antisemite or a white nationalist he doesnt have an antisemitic bone in his body  david horowitz jewish founder of the david horowitz freedom center and editor of frontpage magazine  
when presidentelect donald trump named steve bannon the controversial media figure behind the altright website breitbart news network as his senior strategist  major jewish groups raised the alarm 
the antidefamation league condemned the move saying bannons website was home to racists and fostered hatred against jews but to his jewish defenders  which include breitbarts ceo and senior editors for the site  he is an ally and proud zionist 
i can say without hesitation that steve is a friend of the jewish people and a defender of israel as well as being a passionate american patriot and a great leader joel pollak an orthodox jew and a senior editor for breitbart news wrote on monday 
indeed breitbarts origin story has its roots in israel according to larry solov breitbarts ceo and president another close jewish colleague of bannon 
in a november  post on breitbart news solov describes the conception of the news site in  it happened solov writes during a trip to israel with andrew breitbart the jewish founder and namesake of the website 
the site was born to defend the jewish state 
one thing we specifically discussed that night was our desire to start a site that would be unapologetically profreedom and proisrael solov wrote we were sick of the antiisrael bias of the mainstream media 
solov and breitbart were blown away by the spirit tenacity and resourcefulness of the israeli people on that trip solov wrote 
breitbart died in  and bannon became editor of the site 
under bannons leadership the site became one of the best known platforms and gateways for the altright a diverse group that traffics in white nationalism and racism richard spencer  a founder of the political movement who advocates for the creation of a white ethnostate called breitbart a gateway to altright ideas and writers 
during trumps campaign the site became particularly enamored with the republican candidate and lampooned and attacked his opponents 
for ben shapiro a former writer at breitbart news bannon betrayed the original vision of the sites founder 
andrew breitbart despised racism shapiro wrote on monday with bannon embracing trump all that changed now breitbart has become the altright goto website  pushing white ethnonationalism as a legitimate response to political correctness and the comment section turning into a cesspool for white supremacist mememakers 
but even as the site may have appealed to antisemites it retained its zionist bona fides under bannon 
in  bannon launched a jerusalem branch of breitbart news which covers events in israel it is edited by israelbased american reporter aaron klein another bannon advocate klein a yeshiva university graduate is also a columnist for the jewish press a weekly newspaper with a conservative bent 
klein recently called the antitrump protests across the country a product of professional agitators who are seeking the downfall of the us capitalist system 
the activist pamela geller known for her antiislamic campaigning also counts herself among bannons jewish allies on twitter geller defended bannon recently dismissing those who were characterizing bannon as an antisemite 
he partnered with breitbart  a jew she wrote he partnered with larry solov after breitbart died a jew he worked with me  a jew then she added zionist 
david horowitz founder of the conservative think tank david horowitz freedom center also came to bannons defense saying bannon does not have an antisemitic bone in his body 
as a jew who has worked for years with steve bannon horowitz wrote in an email to the forward i can tell you he is not an antisemite or a white nationalist ld  for further proof that steve bannon is not going to do anything to challenge jewish power in america or stand up to israel see this thoughtprovoking article in the occidental observer  antisemitism as political assassination the smearing of steve bannon i really do feel at this stage though of course i could be wrong that diehard antisemites and ardent white nationalists are most unlikely to see any of their dreams come true in the foreseeable future thats what makes antisemites and white nationalists the angriest people on earth their dreams are constantly being shattered as they see the jews becoming more powerful and tyrannical at their expense constant defeat leaves a bitter taste in the mouth like this share it now",2016-11-21

us republican presidential nominee donald trump says hillary clintons policy towards syria would lead to world war iii arguing that the democratic nominee would drag the us into an armed confrontation with russia 
trump made the warning in an interview with reuters on tuesday following clintons proposal for the establishment of a nofly zone and safe zones in syria earlier this month 
what we should do is focus on isil daesh we should not be focusing on syria trump said 
youre going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to hillary clinton he said 
on october  the democratic nominee said a nofly zone was required inside the warravaged country to stabilize fighting a move that was opposed in congress due to the risk of entering into conflict with russia since a usenforced nofly zone would mean the us could shoot down russian fighter jets should they enter syrian airspace 
clinton also described the situation in syria as incredibly complex since the intervention of russia us democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton speaks at an early vote rally at broward college in coconut creek florida on october   
youre not fighting syria anymore youre fighting syria russia and iran all right russia is a nuclear country but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk trump said 
the republican nominee also referred to the removal of syrian president bashar alassad from power as a secondlevel priority to defeating daesh 
assad is secondary to me to isil trump said 
russia might down us planes 
meanwhile us director of national intelligence james clapper also warned about the consequences of clintons push for a nofly zone in syria that could spark a conflict with russia 
speaking at the council on foreign relations clapper said clintons proposal for the establishment of a nofly zone in syria could lead to russia shooting down american planes there james clapper the us director of national intelligence speaks at the council of foreign relations on october   in new york city 
i wouldnt put it past them to shoot down an american aircraft if they  if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground he said 
i take stock in the nature of the weaponry that they deploy and why they  why they did that clapper said of russian weapons recently deployed to syria the system they have there is a very advanced airdefense system its very capable and i dont think theyd do it and deploy it unless they had some intent to use it 
during the third and final presidential debate last week clinton reiterated her remarks on a nofly zone that could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict in syria 
a foreignbacked militancy has been going on in syria since march  with a plethora of armed groups  each supported by one foreign country or another  fighting the assad government 
since  the united states along with a number of its allies has been leading a socalled antiterror campaign in syria and neighboring iraq 
instead of helping to rein in the takfiri terrorists the air raids have killed many civilians and caused extensive damage to the countrys infrastructure 
iran has been offering syria advisory military help russia another syrian ally has also been conducting an aerial bombardment campaign against militant positions in syria at a request from damascus

it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank  via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states  thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal email server all the way to gun running to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million dollar seaside mansion in dubai in january   another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true  snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed but the truth has a way of coming out on its own as it always has 
the bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of  acres in paraguay in  yet another country good for the bush family since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime if the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the bush administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on   the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request apparently if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous the bushes plan on getting out of the country as well

688,only geniuses  schizophrenics can pass this  question quiz  david avocado wolfe  davidwolfecom,"posted on october   by michael depinto 
for anyone who has heard about but not yet had a chance to learn the details about the undercover operation produced by james okeefe s project veritas about the inner workings of the democrat party youre in luck i have written two different posts covering the subject from different angles and this will be the third covering hillarys response each post include at least some if not all of the undercover recordings released so far by james okeefe  
for over a year okeefe risked his life by going deep undercover into the democrat partys factory of corruption and just this week after everyone laughed at trump for calling the election rigged okeefe began releasing portions of the shocking video he took while undercover in the videos some of the highest ranking members of the dnc make some of the most jawdropping admissions of guilt youve ever heard in your lives not the least of which is we have a call with hillarys campaign every day to go over what areas need more focus 
in the first post i wrote titled george soros master blueprint to conquer the west gets caught on camera  i go into detail about how the money funding all the illegal operations caught on film comes from hillary clinton s largest donor none other than george soros  one very high ranking democratic operative explains what happens with the money once it comes in upon receipt 
the campaign hillary clinton campaign pays the dnc the dnc pays democracy partners democracy partners pays the foval group and the foval group goes and executes the sh on the ground 
wow then when questioned about the legality the response was 
it doesnt matter what the friggin legal and ethics people say we need to win this motherfker 
thats just the beginning the evidence gets infinitely worse then in the second post i wrote titled this video guarantees a trump win even with hillarys fraud machine  i present an honest look at both candidates and how they operate the post contains  of the released undercover footage so far so you learn exactly who is prescribing what to whom and i assure you that nothing can prepare you for what james managed to catch on film youll be sick 
then i contrast the criminal enterprise hillary is running with a montage of videos taken over a  year span of donald trump  and in each of the clips spanning all those years trump is asked about potentially running for the presidency some day some of the answers are  years old and all are spontaneous unlike the scripted and now we know totally false statements we consistently get from hillary it is painfully obvious the answers trump gives are genuine and from the heart 
love him or hate him good luck arguing that trump isnt authentic in the video you get a good look at who would be in the oval office and its not the caricature that team hillary has tried so hard to create on the other hand team hillarys behavior is utterly indefensible and she knows it which is why she runs like hell in the video below the second reporters begin to ask her about the recordings 
theres nowhere to run now though hillary you and your staff have a lot to answer for much of which is criminal in nature go figure

689,pomegranate pistachio pancakes  david avocado wolfe  davidwolfecom,posted on october   by paul joseph watson authorities claim its for security reasons towns across sweden have banned christmas street lights in the name of security but the real reason is almost certainly because the country has completely capitulated to islam after importing countless muslim migrants over the last two years according to an svt report the swedish transport administration trafikverket will not allow municipalities to erect christmas street lights on light poles that the authority manages meaning that many towns will have no festival lights at all on major streets according to speisa  the change is a victory for those who want to tone down the reminder of the countrys christian traditions but according to the swedish transport administration the decision for the drastic change is security poles are not designed for the weight of christmas lights and we have to remove anything that should not be there said eilin isaksson national coordinator at the swedish transport administration the argument that the lights are too heavy and pose a safety risk sounds like complete baloney swedes are being asked to believe that lights normally held up by tree branches are now too weighty to be supported by metal poles despite there being no safety issue with the street lights for decades this new rule has been instituted right after record numbers of muslim migrants flooded into the country  just a coincidence im sure in reality the christmas lights ban is almost certainly an effort to avoid offending muslim migrants who are causing chaos in cities like malmo  where the firebombing of cars and businesses in or near muslim ghetto nogo areas is becoming a routine occurrence as we previously reported  a top swedish bishop advocated removing crosses from a christian church and replacing them with islamic symbols in order to please muslims last christmas it was also announced that a christmas eve special broadcast on public television would be hosted by a muslim woman some areas of sweden are even capitulating to returning isis terrorists by offering jihadists free driving licenses and housing benefits to help them reintegrate into the job market,2016-10-28

tony podesta  brother of the nowdisgraced hillary clinton campaign chair john podesta  whose files wikileaks has been publishing  is not only a powerful democratic party lobbyist but a registered foreign agent receiving a hefty monthly paycheck from the nefarious government of saudi arabia 
no  as tinfoilhat conspiracy theorist as it might sound  that scenario is the absolute truth 
in  john and tony podesta formed the podesta group and have used their bigwig partyinsider status to lobby and influence government policies  while at various times simultaneously holding positions of power  which has created a number of glaring conflicts of interest 
according to the march  filing made in accordance with the foreign agents registration act of  tony podesta is an active foreign agent of the saudi government with the  center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court  and acts as an officer of the saudi arabia account 
at this point the web of payforplay between the washington political heavyweights and foreign governments comes lurching into the spotlight 
for starters the podesta brothers lobbying firm receives  every month from the saudi government which in no uncertain terms  and despite a status as privileged us ally  wages a bloody campaign of censorship murder suppression human rights abuse and worse against its civilian population while bombing hospitals schools and aid convoys in neighboring nations 
john podesta previously served as president bill clintons chief of staff founded the think tank center for american progress which ohsocoincidentally touts the need to reframe saudi arabias hopelessly tarnished image counseled president obama and now chairs hillary clintons campaign 
tony podesta acts as a foreign agent for the kingdom of saudi arabia  lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the kingdom  while also contributing to and bundling for hillary clintons campaign 
think about that for a moment 
one brother uses the influence of money to both affect united states foreign policy and infuse the clinton campaign with cash  while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities 
as the washington post reported months ago in july tony podestas lobbying efforts raised  for the campaign and  for the victory fund 
the saudis hired the podesta group in  because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home including sentencing blogger raif badawi to ten years in prison and  lashes for insulting islam alternet reported  since then tony podestas fingerprints have been all over saudi arabias advocacy efforts in washington dc when saudi arabia executed the prominent nonviolent shia dissident sheikh nimr alnimr causing protests throughout the shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions the new york times noted that the podesta group provided the newspaper with a saudi commentator who defended the execution 
notably the saudis reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up  concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year but suspiciously reckless and errant usbacked coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict 
additionally tony podestas status as a registered foreign agent for saudi arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from april    ironically revealed by wikileaks publishing of his brothers personal communiques  in which former clinton foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director dennis cheng wrote to a small group of insiders 
hi all  we do need to make a decision on this asap as our friends who happen to be registered with fara foreign agents registration act are already donating and raising 
i do want to push back a bit its my job i feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table both for primary and general and then dnc and state parties and how do we explain to people that well take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them that the foundation takes  from foreign govts but we now wont either way we need to make a decision soon 
to which general counsel to the clinton campaign attorney marc elias replied all errors original and emphasis added 
responding to all on this i was not on the call this morning but i lean away from a bright line rule here it seems odd to say that someone who represents alberta canada cant give but a lobbyist for phillip morris can just as we vet lobbyists case by case i would do the same with fara while this may lead to a large number of fara registrants being denied it would not be a flat our ban a total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eyerolling and ill will that it did for obama 
as the exchange continues how to precisely handle the campaigns image with potentially controversial donors  while at all costs maintaining the flow of cash  becomes even more apparent as strategist and campaign manager robby mook responds 
where do we draw the line though 
elias suggests a particularly intricate solution 
if we do it case by case then it will be subjective we would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for in judging whether to take the money we would consider the relationship between that country and the united states its relationship to the state department during hillarys time as secretary and its relationship if any to the foundation in judging the individual we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and hillarys past campaigns specifically 
put simply we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists except with a somewhat more stringent screen 
as a legal matter i am not saying we have to do this  we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely im just offering this up as a middle ground 
mook eventually decides plainly 
marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions dont really get you anythingthat obama actually got judged more harshly as a result he convinced me soin a complete uturn im ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks are you guys ok with that 
all of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect  despite increasing calls for the united states to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody saudi regime  the us approved a stunning  billion sale of smart bombs to the kingdom in november  
tony podestas specific contract with the governmentrun center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court which will earn  million by years end does indeed suggest the infusion of a prosaudi message into the us media propaganda machine 
saudi arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in washington sunlight foundation spokesman josh stewart told the washington post  that spans both what youd call the inside game which is lobbying and government relations and the outside game which is pr and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying 
that broader audience  the american public  has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughlycorrupt clinton campaign if not surreptitiously by the saudis as well 
as the free thought project has repeatedly reported  the evidence of collusion among the democratic national committee hillary clintons campaign and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable  including no less than  socalled journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign 
although this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet and yet at the center of this shit storm of contention is an official nominee for the white house  who will not be held responsible for any number of questionable and criminal acts

the bombshells about this criminal are now breaking daily its not a question of trump it is an imperative that hillary be defeated if the people choose hillary then they must and will be punished wikileaks bill clinton boasts of hillarys working relationship with muslim brotherhood by john hayward breitbart  october   
in a speech bill clinton gave at the home of mehul and hema sanghani in october  revealed to the public for the first time by wikileaks former president bill clinton touted hillary clintons working relationship with the muslim brotherhoods mohamed morsi in egypt as an example of her diplomatic skillspresident clinton also gave his wife a lot of credit for negotiating the iran nuclear deal in a passage that began with the standard democrat stuff happens shrugging defense for foreign policy failures 
finally we live in a world as i said thats full of good news and bad news the united states cannot control it all but we need a president whos most likely to make as many good things happen as possible and most likely to prevent big bad things from happening you cant keep every bad thing from happening whos most likely to be able to get people involved in a positive way even the people who dont like the iran nuclear agreement concede it never would have happened if it hadnt been for the sanctions hillary negotiated those sanctions and got china and russia to sign off  something i thought shed never be able to do i confess im never surprised by anything she does but that surprised me i didnt think she could do it the chinese and the russians to see past their shortterm selfinterest to their longterm interest and not sparking another nuclear arms race 
and when the muslim brotherhood took over in egypt in spite of the fact that we were inaudible she developed a working relationship with the thenpresident and went there and brokered a ceasefire to stop a fullscale shooting war between israel and hamas in gaza which on top of what was going on in syria and the inaudible jordan would have been a calamity for the world 
and when we were trying to reset our relations with russia under president medvedev she and her team negotiated a new start treaty which limits warheads and missiles and she lobbied it through the senate she had to get  votes which means a lot of these republicans who say that they dont like her now are just kidding for election season they trusted her and she got it passed you cant get  votes in the senate without a lot of republican support and i dont know about you but with all this tension and mr putin trying to affect the outcome of the conflict in syria i think its a very good thing that were in a lower risk of any kind of accidental nuclear conflict with the russians she did that 
youll rarely find a more tortured political framing of the iran debacle than bill clinton boasting that the sanctions barack obama lifted were superawesome as even those who dont think those sanctions should have been lifted agree 
mr clintons version of the iran sanctions leaves out a few details  such as russias keen financial interest in keeping iranian energy out of the european market and chinas desire to use iran sanctions as a geopolitical bargaining chip 
but the part about the muslim brotherhood is most interesting if anything he is selling hillary clintons working relationship with egyptian islamists short because she used american diplomatic leverage for morsis benefit even before he got elected warning egyptians about backtracking to a military regime at a key moment of the postmubarak campaign when morsi was running against a former member of hosni mubaraks military there have long been rumors that more subtle forms of us  pressure  were used to secure morsis office as well 
then again in public pronouncements clinton called hosni mubaraks tottering regime stable and cautioned her obama administration colleagues against pushing a longtime partner out the door 
a few days ago declassified state department documents revealed clintons talking points for a  meeting with morsi hailed his election as a milestone in egypts transition to democracy and stated that she was to offer the muslim brotherhood leader technical expertise and assistance from both the us government and private sector to support his economic and social programs 
clinton was also supposed to privately offer morsi assistance with his police and security forces which would be conducted quite discreetly 
after morsi was gone she declared herself exasperated with egyptian political culture and declared herself a cynical realist that is pretty much the opposite of what everyone in the obama administration was saying while the arab spring was in the midst of springing its little surprises on autocratic but americaaligned or at least americafearing regimes which we were all supposed to feel guilty about selfishly supporting for so long 
as for clintons superb working relationship with morsi that eventually ended with morsis wife railing against clinton for supposedly dismissing him as a simpleton who was unfit for the presidency and threatening to publish letters from clinton to morsi that would damage the former us secretary of state meanwhile mohammed morsi is developing a solid working relationship with the egyptian penitentiary system  
egypt has one of those icky military governments again and while it wont have fond memories of hillary clintons support for the muslim brotherhood regime it will most likely work with whoever wins the  us presidential election therefore a prospective president hillary clinton probably wont suffer too much from secretary of state hillary clintons appalling lapses in judgment

by that definition hillary clinton is an alcoholic  exhibit a 
in an email to hillarys campaign chairman john podesta on august   director of communications for hillarys campaign jennifer palmieri wrote referring to hillary 
i think you should call her and sober her up some

on feb   hillarys spokesman nick merrill sent an email presumably to hillarys campaign staff with the subject hrc clips news clips on hillary rodham clinton the news clips that day included an article by benjamin bell for abc news titled one thing that might surprise you about hillary clinton which merrill reproduced in its entirety in his email 
bells article was an interview with new york times national political reporter amy chozick on whether hillary clinton would announce shes running for the presidency one of the questions bell asked chozick was covering hillary clinton what is one thing that has surprised you about her 
chozick answered 
hmm she likes to drink we were on the campaign trail in  and the press thought she was just taking shots to pander to voters in pennsylvania um no 
heres a composite screenshot of the relevant part of merrills email from wikileaks  exhibit c 
according to the national enquirer  top staffers of hillarys campaign told the enquirer they even began this years presidential campaign by secretly planning a stint in rehab for hillary but any rehab therapy quickly failed amid the pressures of the campaign and the effort of making a deal over an fbi probe into her email scandal 
a source said the stress of her political career the neverending scandals and her worsening health plunged her into a lifethreatening booze hell she turned to drink to drown her fears hillary tries to hide her problem like she lies about so many things a close friend of hillary added  hillary has been drinking heavily for years to forget her miserable marriage to serial cheater bill shes also hit the bottle to cope with other stress as well as the boredom of flying all over the world when she was secretary of state 
one hillary insider told the enquirer that hillary has blackouts and wakes up wondering where she is and what she has done  and that shes not fit to be president 
certainly hillary must be drunk when she obscenely ground against the twerking black woman see below because no sane person in her then position as us secretary of state would behave like this in public

696,wikileaks bill clinton boasts of hillarys working relationship with muslim brotherhood,"former united states attorney for the district of columbia joe digenova suggested friday james comeys reopening of the investigation into hillary clintons emails was the product of a revolt inside the fbi 
while speaking with wmals larry oconnor  digenova was asked what comey meant by saying newly discovered clinton emails from anthony weiner and huma abedins devices appear to be pertinent to the fbis prior investigation 
it tells me that the original investigation was not thorough and that it was an incompetent investigation digenova said otherwise they would have discovered this  and ill tell you why 
these were found on the phone that was used by anthony weiner and huma abedin he said why was that phone not looked at originally 
there could be one explanation huma abedin may have denied that any other phone existed and if she did she committed a felony she lied to the fbi just like general cartwright and if she did shes dead meat and comey knows it and theres nothing he can do about it 
digenova continued and why this letter was sent today was very simple the agents came to comey yesterday they told him about the evidence and he said oh s and realized that his goose was cooked that this would prove conclusively that his original investigation was incompetent and he knew that the agents running the weiner case would leak it if he did not send this letter to congress 
and ive also been told something very significant its been reported that those laptops belonging to clinton aides cheryl mills and heather samuelson were destroyed they were not and the reason is the fbi agents refused to do it 
digenova went on to say he believes there is a quiet but serious revolt against the director right now 
he sent those letters today because he is in deep trouble inside the bureau he said comey sent this letter today because he had to he has no moral authority inside the agency right now hes a joke hes a laughingstock of the agency and among former fbi agents he has become an anathema

but as the saying goes water is life  and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement therefore for people concerned with life giving up on this is simply unthinkable the root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism and the perception that money is more important than life itself when the police and national guard attack us citizens on private property to protect corporate interests who are they really working for 
the corporate dream of the keystone xl pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way at the top of this pyramid of profit is texas billionaire kelcy warren ceo of energy transfer partners the company responsible for the project 
so who is kelcy warren 
a native of east texas and graduate of the university of texas at arlington with a degree in civil engineering warren worked in the natural gas industry and became cochair of energy transfer equity in  with business partner ray davis coowner of the texas rangers baseball team warren built energy transfer equity into one of the nations largest pipeline companies which now owns about  miles of pipelines carrying natural gas natural gas liquids refined products and crude oil the companys holdings include sunoco southern union and regency energy partners 
forbes estimates the yearold warrens personal wealth at  billion bloomberg described him as among americas new shale tycoons  but rather than building a fortune by drilling he takes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another chilling boiling pressurizing and processing it until its worth more than when it burst from the wellhead  source  
shockingly in  the governor of texas greg abbott appointed warren to the texas parks and wildlife commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect big bend national park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another  million pipeline project  
according to the governors office the state parks and wildlife commission manages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of texas along with ensuring the future of hunting fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for texans  source  
this glaring conflict of interest has inspired environmental science major at utsa and former texas state park ambassador andrew lucas to begin a drive to have warren removed from this environmental post his petition is described here  
most people may know kelcy warren as the man behind the controversial dakota access pipeline the dallasbased billionaire and ceo of energy transfer partners has been making headlines for fasttracking a  mile crude oil pipeline across the midwest and under the missouri river just north of the standing rock sioux reservation no environmental impact assessment no respect for cultural sites and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river a similar story is unfolding out in west texas where warrens company has split through the pristine big bend region with the  mile comanche trail pipeline and nearlycomplete  mile trans pecos pipeline these pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the trans pecos region 
with untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of energy transfer partners it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago texas governor greg abbott appointed kelcy warren for a  year term as  of the  commissioners who preside over texas parks and wildlife why probably the  in campaign contributions abbott received from warren 
footage of militarized police using the long range acoustic device  lrad  crowd control weapon against protectors at standing rock on october th  final thoughts 
warren is listed as number  on forbes list of wealthiest americans with an estimated net worth of  billion in september of  he is the head of the dakota access pipeline snake 
if you are scratching your head wondering why militarized police and private security contractors are beating gassing and attacking peaceful resistors  including women children and the elderly the answer is they are doing it to protect the interests of kelcy warren and others invested in this pipeline project read more articles by isaac davis

699,comment on former us attorney for dc new hillary email probe was result of revolt inside fbi by tonya parnell,"posted on october   by the free thought project 
decadeold audio exposes thensenator hillary clinton saying the us should have manipulated palestinian parliamentary elections in  to prevent a hamas victory the presidential candidate lamented that the us didnt determine who was going to win 
i do not think we should have pushed for an election in the palestinian territories i think that was a big mistake thennew york senator clinton told the jewish press a new yorkbased weekly newspaper several months after the january election 
and if we were going to push for an election then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win she said 
until friday the comment clinton made on september   only existed on a private audio cassette belonging to journalist eli chomsky an editor and a staff writer for the jewish press he interviewed clinton at the newspapers office in brooklyn 
chomsky who shared and played the tape for the observer says it is the only existing copy of that meeting with clinton during which the palestinian parliamentary election was among primary topics the comments have been posted on soundcloud 
speaking to the news portal he recalled being confused by the fact that anyone could support the idea  offered by a national political leader no less  that the us should be in the business of fixing foreign elections  audio emerges of clinton proposing election rigging in palestine censored by israeli press for past  years httpstcolsmycuzjr 
 wikileaks wikileaks october   
the interview took place nine months after the hamas movement claimed  of the  parliamentary seats pushing aside the usfavored fatah movement and securing the right to form a new cabinet that victory was neither welcomed in israel nor in the us in washington where hamas is considered a terrorist organization officials repeatedly stated that they would not work with a palestinian authority that included hamas 
thenpresident george w bush spoke of the elections as symbolizing the power of democracy but refused to deal with hamas as long as it opposed israels existence and espoused violence 
that day in september  clinton made odd and controversial comments all now saved on the minute record that chomsky held onto all these years 
i went to my bosses at the time chomsky told the observer the jewish press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody  even a direct quote from anyone  in a position of influence because they might need them down the road my bosses didnt think it was newsworthy at the time i was convinced that it was and i held onto it all these years dont forget to follow the dc clothesline on facebook and twitter please help spread the word by sharing our articles on your favorite social networks share this",2016-10-30
700,this is the man militarized police at standing rock are working for,"if you signed up for obamacare youve been screwed 
if you didnt sign up and opted to pay the penalties  youve been screwed 
if you didnt sign up didnt pay penalties and stuck with your original insurance company youve been screwed 
if you didnt sign up didnt pay penalties and paid cash for medical care youve been screwed 
every person in america has been affected regardless of what you did or did not do 
thats because the affordable care act irrevocably ruined our access to medical care at an affordable price in this country in the mere span of  years the prices have skyrocketed and many families have to pay more in monthly premiums than they pay on their mortgages meanwhile medical costs have been driven up to astronomical prices making it nearly impossible to pay outofpocket for care 
and these premiums they are for the crappiest coverage you can imagine some families pay  a month for  coverage after they pay the  deductible thats nearly  per year before obamacare pays for a penny of their costs 
and nownow that insurance companies have gone belly up when they were forced to become a part of the exchange medical costs are skyrocketing doctors wont see patients who arent covered employers stopped offering insurance as a benefit and people lost their jobs due to obamacare costs 
the whole thing is failing even president obama has admitted it  and now we have proof that it was planned that way 
but that isnt the worst of it the worst of it is that this program was designed to fail and steer us into single payer healthcare where a government entity can decide what procedures will or will not be covered theyll decide who is deserving of cancer treatment and who is not theyll mandate things like flu shots and childhood vaccines 
one of the recent wikileaks shows that hillary clinton knew this and was complicit 
melissa dykes of the daily sheeple wrote  
in an email thread dated september   between hillary and her senior policy adviser ann oleary titled memo on cadillac tax for hrc hillary wrote given the politics now w bipartisan support including schumer ill support repeal w sense of the senate that revenues would have to be found id be open to a range of options to do that but we have to be careful that the r version passes which begins the unraveling of the aca  
which begins the unraveling of the affordable care act 
a democrat supporting republican legislation to destroy obamacare on purpose how many millions have they raked in on this deal and bilked the american people for in obamacare penalties because they cant afford the affordable health care and the american people will look at this like a victory when it does unravel even though it has been the plan all along 
hillary clinton that savior of woman and children knew that this would fail  she is supporting the legislation to destroy it leaving everyone in america at the mercy of the horrible replacement that she will dream up to redistribute wealth and deal the death blow to the alreadystruggling middle class

702,leaked audio catches clinton redhanded talking about rigging elections,"posted by tim brown 
on monday a man who voted for donald trump was arrested for wearing a tshirt that referenced hillary clinton s comments about trump supporters being  deplorables  to the polls 
brett mauthe  was arrested after he went to the polls wearing a protrump hat and a shirt that read  basket of deplorables  
according to ksat  mauthe removed his hat at the request of those who were overseeing the polls however since the tshirt did not violate the election code he refused to turn it inside out nor remove it 
subsequently he was arrested and charged with electioneering 
ksat  reports  
bulverde police chief gary haecker confirmed the arrest but declined to release details instead he deferred to comal countys election coordinator cynthia jaqua 
jaqua said the offense of electioneering isnt limited to people who stand outside polling places holding signs violations can be committed by voters as well 
it can mean a tshirt a button a hat you know she said anything related to the voting the party the candidate 
jaqua declined to release specific details about mauthes arrest 
jaqua is quoted by my san antonio  
its in the election code electioneering is prohibited within a foot marker you cannot express views for or against a candidate or political party by wearing buttons tshirts hats whatever else or carrying signs she said 
most people who make the mistake manage to avoid going to jail she added 
every election we have to advise people even if its a school bond issue they wear candidates shirts and we just have to remind them please go into the restroom and turn it inside out this is the first time i recall someone getting arrested she said during two decades working at the county election office 
a gentleman did walk in a little while ago with a slogan for trump and when i asked him to please take it off he was real nice and took it off she added while working a polling site thursday afternoon in new braunfels 
so according to this nonsense a perfectly legal shirt could be worn to the polls one day but if a politician makes reference to the phrase on that shirt it becomes illegal to wear it to the polls the next day this is utterly ridiculous 
my question on all of that is what happened to free speech is that recognized as a godgiven right in the first amendment i mean i realize that the constitution is to restrict the federal government but honestly shouldnt the states recognize the right of free speech even in a polling place seems to me those kinds of laws stifle the very thing you are electing representatives to ensure are protected 
other voters agree with me 
i dont feel like you should be preaching to anybody but i do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate georgina pereida said after casting her vote im kind of shocked because i think thats part of the freedoms that were voting for 
jose tovar claims that you should know the rules and regulations if you are  and vote again i ask why are there laws and regulations restricting this freedom of speech its not inflammatory it isnt a lie it isnt slander whats illegal about it 
ill tell you politicians want to control people and this is one of many means they use to do that this is what happens when you dont hold your elected officials accountable for the stupid regulations they impose 
mauthe decided to not comment anymore after his story began to be altered in the media 
the reason im not going to talk any more to the media is that the story gets twisted around and i dont want to give you any comment he said  
the charged of electioneering is a class c misdemeanor

706,comment on hillary is so unpopular she has to pay off youth voters and fabricate her rallies by dl,"the american medical association defines an alcoholic as someone who has a prolonged period of frequent heavy alcohol use is unable to control drinking once it has begun has withdrawal symptoms when the individual stops using alcohol needs to use more and more alcohol to achieve the same effects has a variety of social andor legal problems arising from alcohol use 
by that definition hillary clinton is an alcoholic  exhibit a 
in an email to hillarys campaign chairman john podesta on august   director of communications for hillarys campaign jennifer palmieri wrote referring to hillary 
i think you should call her and sober her up some 
heres a screenshot of the email released by wikileaks  exhibit b 
on feb   hillarys spokesman nick merrill sent an email presumably to hillarys campaign staff with the subject hrc clips news clips on hillary rodham clinton the news clips that day included an article by benjamin bell for abc news titled one thing that might surprise you about hillary clinton which merrill reproduced in its entirety in his email 
bells article was an interview with new york times national political reporter amy chozick on whether hillary clinton would announce shes running for the presidency one of the questions bell asked chozick was covering hillary clinton what is one thing that has surprised you about her 
chozick answered 
hmm she likes to drink we were on the campaign trail in  and the press thought she was just taking shots to pander to voters in pennsylvania um no 
heres a composite screenshot of the relevant part of merrills email from wikileaks  exhibit c 
according to the national enquirer  top staffers of hillarys campaign told the enquirer they even began this years presidential campaign by secretly planning a stint in rehab for hillary but any rehab therapy quickly failed amid the pressures of the campaign and the effort of making a deal over an fbi probe into her email scandal 
a source said the stress of her political career the neverending scandals and her worsening health plunged her into a lifethreatening booze hell she turned to drink to drown her fears hillary tries to hide her problem like she lies about so many things a close friend of hillary added  hillary has been drinking heavily for years to forget her miserable marriage to serial cheater bill shes also hit the bottle to cope with other stress as well as the boredom of flying all over the world when she was secretary of state 
one hillary insider told the enquirer that hillary has blackouts and wakes up wondering where she is and what she has done  and that shes not fit to be president 
certainly hillary must be drunk when she obscenely ground against the twerking black woman see below because no sane person in her then position as us secretary of state would behave like this in public

707,comment on this is the man militarized police at standing rock are working for by hawkmo,"posted on october   by claire bernish 
cannon ball nd  on thursday police from no less than five states sporting full riot gear and armed with heavy lethal and nonlethal weaponry pepper spray mace a number of atvs five tanks two helicopters and militaryequipped humvees showed up to tear down an encampment of standing rock sioux water protectors and supporters armed with  nothing 
under orders from the nownotorious morton county sheriffs office this ridiculously heavyhanded standing army came better prepared to do battle than some actual military units fighting overseas 
but the target of their operation  a group of slightly more than  native american water protectors and supporters opposing construction of the dakota access pipeline  never intended to do battle with the armed taxpayerfunded corporatebacked statesponsored aggressors 
reports vary but no less than  people were arrested thursday and  according to witnesses  police marked numbers on arrestees arms and housed them in cementfloored dog kennels  without any padding before they were transported as far away as fargo 
it goes back to concentration camp days asserted ocetisakowin coordinator mekasi camphorinek who along with his mother was marked and detained in a mesh kennel reports the los angeles times  
although thursdays incident remained relatively peaceful for some time with only shouts chants and occasional attempts by water protectors to convince this standing army to examine its motives and reconsider clashes nonetheless broke out  solely because of gratuitous police aggression 
after facing off for a couple hours these militant cops began closing in on the water protectors to shut down the treaty of  camp  in reference to the fort laramie treaty of that year which established a large parcel of land designated exclusively native american territory not to be disturbed by the us government prior to his arrest camphorinek had established the camp stating as cited by indigenous rising  
today the oceti sakowin has enacted eminent domain on dapl lands claiming  treaty rights this is unceded land highway  as of this point is blockaded we will be occupying this land and staying here until this pipeline is permanently stopped we need bodies and we need people who are trained in nonviolent direct action we are still staying nonviolent and we are still staying peaceful 
despite the water protectors commitment to nonviolence the militarized police response went as would be expected  horribly awry 
a prayer circle of elders including several women was interrupted and all were arrested for standing peacefully on the public road stated a press release from indigenous environment network a tipi was erected in the road and was recklessly dismantled despite law enforcement statements that they would merely mark the tipi with a yellow ribbon and ask its owners to retrieve it a group of water protectors was also dragged out of a sweat lodge ceremony erected in the path of the pipeline thrown to the ground and arrested 
claims to the contrary by morton county sheriff kyle kirchmeier aside native american and indigenous water protectors and supporters have refrained from violent acts on the whole preferring instead peaceful prayer vigils and acts of civil disobedience 
no matter how peacefully the opposition acts armed defenders of big oil interests seem determined to brutalize  disrespect and generally incite and inflict violence against those who desire unsullied water for generations to come 
in fact at the beginning of september a private security firm hired by energy transfer partners the company responsible for pipeline construction indiscriminately unleashed vicious attack dogs on water protectors press and supporters  for reasons as yet unknown 
during the savage attack a pregnant woman young girl and many others suffered serious dog bites thanks to the ineptitude of the dogs handlers afterward a warrant for inciting a riot was issued democracy now journalist amy goodman  for doing her job filming events as they happened  though charges were subsequently thrown out 
although etp and some law enforcement officers defended the barbarous actions of the private security mercenaries the guardian now reports that  because the guards lacked proper licensing  they could now face criminal charges on wednesday the morton county sheriffs office made the determination that dog handlers were not properly licensed to do security work in the state of north dakota 
bob frost owner of ohiobased frost kennels told the guardian  all the proper protocols  were already done i pulled my guys out the next day because we werent there to go to war with these protesters 
frost insisted he had cooperated with authorities investigating the incident  but the sheriffs department disagrees seven handlers and dogs were deployed to the scene in early september allegedly in response to reports of trespassers but according to the guardian  police have only managed to identify two people 
the sheriffs department claims frost has not provided necessary information and unnamed security officials cited in the report said that there were no intentions of using the dogs or handlers for security work  however because of the protest events the dogs were deployed as a method of trying to keep the protesters under control 
in a statement cited by the guardian  morton county captain jay gruebele said although lists of security employees have been provided there is no way of confirming whether the list is accurate or if names have been purposely withheld 
water protectors in the meantime are left to deal with absurdly disproportionate state violence  and the altogether unacceptable disrespectful and demeaning insult of being relegated to dog kennels after being arrested for exercising their rights 
as lakota country times editor brandon ecoffey wrote in an editorial thursday 
over the course of the last several months the abuse of detainees by morton county law enforcement has overstepped every boundary guaranteed by the american constitution water protectors have been seen being bound and hooded by police people are being stripped searched and abused within their jail for misdemeanor crimes and police have employed the use of mass surveillance through drones on the protector camps this isnt a war zone this is north dakota dont forget to follow the dc clothesline on facebook and twitter please help spread the word by sharing our articles on your favorite social networks share this",2016-10-31

709,comment on hillary clinton is an alcoholic by jonathan brooks,"posted on october   by daisy luther 
oh loretta 
ill bet that ag loretta lynch is shaking in her boots right now because when hillary clinton goes down lynchs career will go down with her heck maybe theyll even be cellmates 
loretta lynchs ties to the clintons go back to  when thenpresident bill clinton appointed her to run the brooklyn us attorneys office she left in  and went into private practice but returned to the brooklyn office in  at the behest of president barack obama  heres her official bio  
in  she was sworn in to become the rd attorney general of the united states taking the place of the blatantly corrupt attorney general eric holder  who will probably be most famous for his roles in the fast and furious operation inciting racial tensions and his mishandling of the lois lernerirs debacle first there was the secret airplane meeting with bill clinton 
it all started to publicly go downhill for lynch during the first investigation into hillary clintons carelessness with national secrets via her home email server  right before fbi director james comey was to meet with hillary clinton to interrogate her about the subject lynch was busted having a secret meeting with bill clinton  the washington post reported 
clintons private unplanned meeting with attorney general loretta e lynch at the phoenix airport last week coming at a time when the justice department should be nearing completion of its examination of hillary clintons use of a private server for her emails as secretary of state will inevitably  and negatively  affect public attitudes about that investigation 
lynch has tried to make amends though not without leaving some confusion in her wake in a conversation friday with washington post editorial writer jonathan capehart at the aspen ideas festival she insisted again that the conversation was innocent  about grandchildren and golf and such  and did not touch on the investigation of the emails but she said she recognized that others would not see it that way the fact that the meeting that i had is now casting a shadow over how people are going to view that work is something that i take seriously and deeply and painfully she said 
lynch said that she would be accepting whatever recommendation the career prosecutors and fbi director james b comey bring her  though she did not say she would remove herself completely from the case she also said she had made that decision some months ago but was only now making it public 
of course it was all much easier for lynch to abide by the decision when comey miraculously found that hillary clinton was not criminal in her negligence with national secrets 
now though people are asking questions about that illfounded meeting judicial watch has filed a lawsuit for all records related to the illicit meeting between attorney general lynch and former president bill clinton  
on june   attorney general loretta lynch is reported to have met privately with former president bill clinton on board a parked private plane at sky harbor international airport in phoenix arizona the meeting occurred during the thenongoing investigation of mrs clintons email server and mere hours before the benghazi report was released publicly involving both mrs clinton and the obama administration judicial watch filed a request on june  that the us department of justice office of the inspector general investigate that meeting 
republican presidential nominee donald trump suggested that during that meeting bill clinton may have offered to extend lynchs position in the ags office during a hillary clinton administration then she blocked a congressional investigation into the notorious iranian ransom payment 
last week ag lynch blocked a congressional investigation into the cash payments that the obama administration made to iran by pleading the fifth the washington free beacon reported 
attorney general loretta lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of congress about the obama administrations secret efforts to send iran  billion in cash earlier this year prompting accusations that lynch has pleaded the fifth amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the washington free beacon  
it is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the peoples elected representatives in congress about an important national security issue the lawmakers wrote your staff failed to address any of our questions and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue 
as the united states chief law enforcement officer it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries they stated the actions of your department come at time when iran continues to hold americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison 
how very judicial of her lynch tried to shut comey up about the new investigation into the clinton emails 
now even the mainstream media cant turn its head 
earlier i wrote about the fact that fbi director james comey made the decision on his own to go public about the new investigation into the hillary clinton emails but lets talk a little further about lynchs desperate attempts to shut him up 
the new york times reported that the justice department strongly discouraged comey against releasing the information the day before the fbi director james b comey sent a letter to congress announcing that new evidence had been discovered that might be related to the completed hillary clinton email investigation the justice department strongly discouraged the step and told him that he would be breaking with longstanding policy three law enforcement officials said on saturday senior justice department officials did not move to stop him from sending the letter officials said but they did everything short of it pointing to policies against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections 
how interesting that its seen as influencing the election to investigate someone now but it wasnt back when she was investigated and not charged im not sure exactly how that works but according to usa today emphasis mine a federal official familiar with comeys decision said saturday that the fbi director considered the attorney generals advice during a spirited discussion of the matter thursday and early friday but felt compelled to act do you remember janet reno 
poor janet was another attorney general who went down for the clintons she was also sworn in as ag under bill clinton and many questioned her appointment at the time according to a report in the chicago tribune  
she arrived in washington from miami as caesars wife and so she has remained she was ignorant and independent of insider dc and has stayed that way bill clinton never much liked her and never confided in her and she reciprocated 
she became ag just in time to take the fall for the debacle in waco  actually according to historycom 
the waco standoff had already begun by the time janet reno became the first female attorney general on march   she approved the fbis tear gas plan the following month explaining that negotiations with the branch davidians had stalemated and that the children inside the compound were at risk we will never know whether there was a better solution reno said in  everyone involved  made their best judgments based on all the information we had nonetheless a republicanled congressional report called her decision premature wrong and highly irresponsible she was also criticized when facts emerged contradicting some of her earlier statements 
the tribune post continued to discuss renos position as a scapegoat 
every day since she took office  she has been supervising at least one probe embarrassing to clintonwhitewater fundraising lewinsky china espionage etc clinton cant afford the political beating he would take if he cashiered her 
but no such attorney general could have survived the clinton scandals much less survived them with her own reputationand her departmentsintact 
attorney generals who have anything to do with the clintons dont seem to fare too well they end up so embroiled in clinton scandals that they too are pulled down into the mire regardless of what their intentions were when they started out lynch can see her futureand it has something to do with help wanted ads 
the last time lynch was involved in the clinton email kerfuffle she promised to abide by fbi director james comeys recommendation  
i wonder if shell make that same promise this time 
she really cant because if she does it will show she was complicit with the clintons the last time around and also this time when she decried comeys release of information about the investigation 
i wonder if she and hillary clinton will be able to get adjoining cells whenif the truth comes out

711,comment on congress attorney general lynch pleads fifth on secret iran ransom payments by marlene,"daisy luther 
according to a report in the new yorker james comey  big kahuna of the fbi went fullon cowboy in releasing details of the new clinton email inquiry apparently the department of justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election 
gosh i wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was donald trump who was being investigated by the fbi 
comey explained his decision in a letter to fbi employees  
we dont ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations but here i feel an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record 
the doj  and by doj i mean attorney general loretta lynch  who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with bill clinton to talk about her nonexistent grandchildren  is implying that comey is not playing fair and that the move is inconsistent with the rules which have been designed to make it seem like they are not interfering in an election 
heres comeys letter to the senate judiciary committee 
really 
the doj thinks that the public shouldnt know that the person they may be voting for is being investigated by the fbi 
thats the most absurd thing i have heard for quite some time and considering this election thats really saying something 
this is from the new yorker report emphasis mine 
on friday james comey the director of the federal bureau of investigation acting independently of attorney general loretta lynch  sent a letter to congress saying that the fbi had discovered emails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of hillary clintons private server coming less than two weeks before the presidential election comeys decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about clinton was contrary to the views of the attorney general according to a wellinformed administration official lynch expressed her preference that comey follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise  
comeys decision is a striking break with the policies of the department of justice according to current and former federal legal officials comey who is a republican appointee of president obama has a reputation for integrity and independence but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the presidential and congressional elections  source  is this investigation the iceberg to hrcs titanic campaign 
hillary clinton has said she finds the development unprecedented and deeply troubling source  
oh ill bet she does 
ill bet if trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage gripping the podium to stay upright  saying how wonderful it was that comey decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws ill bet shed be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation ill bet shed take the high road and say that those elected to the office of president of the united states have to be above and beyond reproach 
of course when its her things are a little different arent they 
we do have a right to know we absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets it seems like a nobrainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her 
and the fact that we know has severely damaged clintons campaign although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake  it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls a poll from abc news and the washington post  both hotbeds of liberal voters has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over donald trump due to the clinton email scandal 
about a third of likely voters say theyre less likely to support clinton given fbi director james comeys disclosure friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state  
finally some people are actually paying attention to the character of hillary clinton 
but it may not be enough there was one finding that was astonishing to me even though it probably shouldnt be 
given other considerations  percent say it makes no difference 
meanwhile on social media the fbi emails are somehow not a trending topic it certainly appears that twitter facebook snapchat and buzzfeed are blacking out the topic my biggest question is this why now 
why did james comey who has probably committed career suicide along with a potential actual suicide via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the clintons feel the need to break the news particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation 
opponents will jump on the fact that hes a republican and will say that he did it for political reasons 
they wont admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the clinton email negligence 
they will never ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that perhaps when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong he took it clinton isnt taking it gracefully 
clintons complaints which have appeared in the press around the world make her look even worse than she did before 
this is from the telegraph  a uk publication 
hillary clinton was furiously fighting to keep her presidential bid on track on saturday night as her lead in the polls narrowed after the fbis bombshell announcement that it had reopened its investigation into her emails 
james comey announced on friday afternoon that fresh evidence had emerged for his investigation into whether mrs clinton was criminally negligent in her handling of classified material 
on saturday the latest poll of polls by tracker site realclearpolitics put clinton  percentage points ahead of the republican nationwide down from  points just  days previously 
but wait  it gets better 
the clinton campaign has responded with what amounts to a declaration of open warfare against mr comey alleging that his actions are backed by a political motive and mrs clinton herself called the decision unprecedented and deeply troubling 
its pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election she complained addressing cheering supporters at a rally in the mustwin state of florida 
democrats questioned the timing of the agencys decision which comes as polls showed mrs clintons lead falling just  days before the presidential election 
this is like an wheeler smacking into us and it just becomes a huge distraction at the worst possible time said donna brazile the chairwoman of the democratic national committee 
the campaign is trying to cut through the noise as best it can 
we dont want it to knock us off our game but on the secondtolast weekend of the race we find ourselves having to tell voters keep your focus keep your eyes on the prize 
hillarys campaign manager sounds pretty desperate to me as for the complaints from hrc they just make her sound like the outoftouch moneygrabbing powerhungry deceitful",2016-10-31
712,comment on if clinton goes down loretta lynch will go down with her by truth detector,"posted by michael snyder 
i realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately  emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and her estranged husband anthony weiner now that the fbi is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge hillary clinton with a crime could be made by november th of course the most likely scenario is that hillary clinton will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the clinton campaign but if the fbi does quickly take action it is possible that hillary clinton could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate 
in fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for clinton to willingly remove herself from the race for example the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled  democrats should ask clinton to step aside  
so what should the democrats do now 
if ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process 
they would demand that mrs clinton step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee sen tim kaine of virginia stand in her place 
democrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her homebrew email server from the time she was secretary of state having clinton anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea 
but what the author of that article does not understand is that tim kaine would not automatically take her place if clinton steps down before the election in a previous article  i included a quote from a us news  world report article that explained what would happen if hillary clinton was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november th 
if clinton were to fall off the ticket democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boatrocking socialist sen bernie sanders of vermont 
dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are  committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold  spots for selection by states along with an optional  slots dnc members can choose to fill 
but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed 
so if this email scandal forced hillary clinton to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee 
who would they choose 
lets take a look at the top five options 
 tim kaine 
he would seem to be an obvious choice since he is hillary clintons running mate but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him 
and at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail in fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens 
so to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee 
 joe biden 
vicepresident joe biden has far more name recognition than tim kaine does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run  
vice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it 
biden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was reopening their criminal probe into clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state made him secondguess his decision last year not to run 
but according to the vice president the short answer is no the only thing that kept him from running biden said was the recent death of his son beau 
unfortunately for biden he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does 
biden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesnt have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers 
biden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats but he might not be a winning choice 
 bernie sanders 
bernie sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runnerup to hillary clinton but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against bernie sanders 
first of all he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats he has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over 
secondly the democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this 
thirdly democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election 
so even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list 
 elizabeth warren 
elizabeth warren would be very popular with the bernie sanders wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace hillary clinton with another woman 
so she is definitely a possibility 
but she does lack name recognition and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies 
 michelle obama 
one recent survey found that  percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for hillary clinton 
and these days barack obamas approval rating is running anywhere from  to  
so the thought of another obama in the white house is not as farfetched as you might think 
michelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very wellliked by the american people and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently for instance her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the  campaign in a recent msn article entitled  in this campaign michelle obama became more than just another political voice  
the speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented obamas place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority three months before leaving the white house she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title 
when you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry said anita mcbride former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university we know she didnt like politics but she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out people listen to her 
if i were the democrats michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump 
of course the obamas are just as radical as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point 
and i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if hillary clinton has to step aside because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her 
in the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force hillary clinton out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen 
and if it does happen it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down

714,comment on ag lynch told fbi director comey not to go public with the new clinton email investigation by ann tenna,"posted by david risselada 
much to the surprise of the american electorate both on the right and left the fbi is reopening its investigation into hillary clintons email scandal  whether this will amount to anything meaningful or it is simply a distraction is any bodys guess many are speculating that this could be the issue which would cause president obama to cancel the elections  in my recent article corrupting ones self is the ultimate morality in the pursuit of utopia i discussed the possibility that the blatant corruption is deliberately being thrust in our face to create the necessary attitude for social change this idea of course is based on the writings of alinsky and other social engineers skilled in the arts of propaganda and psychological manipulation looking at it from this perspective cancelled elections are a possibility the truth is with hillary clinton you never know what to expect because she is operating from an ends justify the means mentality and she is willing to do anything to see her dreams of a collectivized america move forward 
according to elizabeth harrington from the washington free beacon the clinton campaign began conducting focus groups to determine which approach hillary should take concerning her run for the presidency hillary is diehard ideologue whose beliefs are right in line with communists dictators like stalin and mao she believes that ordinary people have no idea how to best conduct their personal business and the state should be involved in every aspect of our lives the goal of these focus groups was to determine the attitudes of the electorate in order to mold her message and her personality into something they would vote for many people would attempt to ridicule and discredit anyone associating hillary clinton with communists because she comes across as compassionate and caring always blaming everything on a vast right wing conspiracy 
this has always been the modus operandi of the communist movement and it explains why so many young people have no idea about the atrocities committed under the regimes of communist rulers todays millennials are well aware of the holocaust and the millions of jews murdered by adolph hitler they may not however know that hitler murdered more than jews he started by eliminating the sick and disabled then he murdered christians homosexuals and anyone else essentially that didnt go along with his national socialism the belief is that fascism is an extreme right wing world view this explains the hostility towards todays conservative movement they have been branded as fascists when in fact the truth is the exact opposite on the true political scale national socialism or fascism is to the right of communism which represents complete state control but it is still way left of center a true extreme right wing world view would be complete absence of government control over anything with this being said and understanding that the horrors of communism have all been forgotten simply because they are no longer being taught the communists have been very successful in deceiving people because like hillary clinton they pretend to be something they are not 
millions of young people in america due to left wing indoctrination in our universities  are falling for the communist propaganda under the guise that communism is a more fair compassionate system of economics left wing professors refusing to acknowledge the failures of communism because they believe the right leader has not come along to implement it the right way have failed to teach these young minds that the pursuit of total equality has led to the death of  people under communist controlled governments communists believing not in god but in evolution and science believe that man can be trained into submission and a refusal to accept communist ideals is in fact a sign of mental deficiency therefore it is justifiable to eliminate them to understand this read brainwashing a synthesis of the russian textbook on psychopolitics communists also hide this belief by claiming their pursuit of equality is motivated by a pursuit of social and economic justice when in fact it is motivated by a pure desire to control every aspect of human being 
the black book of communism references the historical debate over the evil natures of both communism and nazism adolf hitler despite his cruelty was open about what his intentions were he set out to create a perfect race that understood its role was to serve the state and nothing else this isnt any different than the goals of communism truthfully only insofar as communists seek to accomplish this on a global scale using the economic class issue as opposed to race while national socialism focuses on achieving such a goal for the country itself the communists on the other hand as mentioned above pretended to be compassionate about the poor and oppressed when in reality they use these groups to organize for power while hiding behind the guise of compassion and the struggle to achieve social justice while in realitythey are systematically imprisoning and murdering all that dont go along with their agenda this according to the black book of communism makes the communist ideology if you could really assign degrees of evil more evil than nazism because of its deceptive nature 
we all know hillary clinton is a liar and she wrote her college thesis on saul alinsky but do we know anything else about her given the fact that she conducted focus groups to help mold her campaign message it is obvious she is hiding something over the past several weeks we have seen references to leaked emails which show she has an obvious disdain for the average american and the common beliefs in liberty that most of us share she has referred to many of us as irredeemable deplorables in an effort to brand us as the uncompassionate ones while pretending to care about the poor and so called oppressed in fact this is the whole strategy of the democrat party because as we all know they have taken a hard turn left and do not represent the views of most americans they will however pretend to in order to get in office what are her intentions if she were to assume office are the massive dehumanization campaigns where conservatives are labeled as fascists and whites as automatic racists a first step to a repeat of history where millions were slaughtered because they were deemed as undesirable by their own government looking at the deceptive nature of hillary clinton and the violent nature of the left it sure seems like a distinct possibility 
the number of deaths under communist regimes from the black book of communism soviet union vladimr lenin and joseph stalin million deaths chinamao  million deaths vietnam ho chi mihn  million deaths north korea  million deaths cambodia pol pot  million deaths eastern europe  million deaths latin america  deaths africa  million deaths afghanistan under soviet control  million deaths 
these are not deaths represented by wartime or revolutions but by outright murder committed by evil men intent on creating perfect societies based on social justice and equality i guess the question remains is man capable of bringing about a perfect society

715,will michelle obama be the replacement nominee if the fbi email investigation ends hillary clintons campaign,"posted by daisy luther 
according to a report in the new yorker james comey  big kahuna of the fbi went fullon cowboy in releasing details of the new clinton email inquiry apparently the department of justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election 
gosh i wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was donald trump who was being investigated by the fbi 
comey explained his decision in a letter to fbi employees  
we dont ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations but here i feel an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record 
the doj  and by doj i mean attorney general loretta lynch  who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with bill clinton to talk about her nonexistent grandchildren  is implying that comey is not playing fair and that the move is inconsistent with the rules which have been designed to make it seem like they are not interfering in an election 
heres comeys letter to the senate judiciary committee 
really 
the doj thinks that the public shouldnt know that the person they may be voting for is being investigated by the fbi 
thats the most absurd thing i have heard for quite some time and considering this election thats really saying something 
this is from the new yorker report emphasis mine 
on friday james comey the director of the federal bureau of investigation acting independently of attorney general loretta lynch  sent a letter to congress saying that the fbi had discovered emails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of hillary clintons private server coming less than two weeks before the presidential election comeys decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about clinton was contrary to the views of the attorney general according to a wellinformed administration official lynch expressed her preference that comey follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise  
comeys decision is a striking break with the policies of the department of justice according to current and former federal legal officials comey who is a republican appointee of president obama has a reputation for integrity and independence but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the presidential and congressional elections  source  is this investigation the iceberg to hrcs titanic campaign 
hillary clinton has said she finds the development unprecedented and deeply troubling source  
oh ill bet she does 
ill bet if trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage gripping the podium to stay upright  saying how wonderful it was that comey decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws ill bet shed be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation ill bet shed take the high road and say that those elected to the office of president of the united states have to be above and beyond reproach 
of course when its her things are a little different arent they 
we do have a right to know we absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets it seems like a nobrainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her 
and the fact that we know has severely damaged clintons campaign although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake  it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls a poll from abc news and the washington post  both hotbeds of liberal voters has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over donald trump due to the clinton email scandal 
about a third of likely voters say theyre less likely to support clinton given fbi director james comeys disclosure friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state  
finally some people are actually paying attention to the character of hillary clinton 
but it may not be enough there was one finding that was astonishing to me even though it probably shouldnt be 
given other considerations  percent say it makes no difference 
meanwhile on social media the fbi emails are somehow not a trending topic it certainly appears that twitter facebook snapchat and buzzfeed are blacking out the topic my biggest question is this why now 
why did james comey who has probably committed career suicide along with a potential actual suicide via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the clintons feel the need to break the news particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation 
opponents will jump on the fact that hes a republican and will say that he did it for political reasons 
they wont admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the clinton email negligence 
they will never ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that perhaps when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong he took it clinton isnt taking it gracefully 
clintons complaints which have appeared in the press around the world make her look even worse than she did before 
this is from the telegraph  a uk publication 
hillary clinton was furiously fighting to keep her presidential bid on track on saturday night as her lead in the polls narrowed after the fbis bombshell announcement that it had reopened its investigation into her emails 
james comey announced on friday afternoon that fresh evidence had emerged for his investigation into whether mrs clinton was criminally negligent in her handling of classified material 
on saturday the latest poll of polls by tracker site realclearpolitics put clinton  percentage points ahead of the republican nationwide down from  points just  days previously 
but wait  it gets better 
the clinton campaign has responded with what amounts to a declaration of open warfare against mr comey alleging that his actions are backed by a political motive and mrs clinton herself called the decision unprecedented and deeply troubling 
its pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election she complained addressing cheering supporters at a rally in the mustwin state of florida 
democrats questioned the timing of the agencys decision which comes as polls showed mrs clintons lead falling just  days before the presidential election 
this is like an wheeler smacking into us and it just becomes a huge distraction at the worst possible time said donna brazile the chairwoman of the democratic national committee 
the campaign is trying to cut through the noise as best it can 
we dont want it to knock us off our game but on the secondtolast weekend of the race we find ourselves having to tell voters keep your focus keep your eyes on the prize 
hillarys campaign manager sounds pretty desperate to me as for the complaints from hrc they just make her sound like the outoftouch moneygrabbing powerhungry deceitful",2016-10-31

717,the deceptive nature of hillary clinton is right in line with communism,"posted on october   by claire bernish 
censorship by facebook has become a thorn in the side of nearly anyone with an opinion differing from the narrative touted by the corporate press  for instance sentiments not praising hillary clinton  and now through both a new report from reuters and emails published by wikileaks we have insight into why certain posts are targeted 
facebook relies on a combination of artificial intelligence and human judgment to remove posts deemed offensive violent or otherwise unacceptable to its community standards  but precisely how the ultimate call to take down posts pages and groups are made remains unknown 
and facebook takedowns no matter the improvements to the process the social media behemoth claims to make have been no less controversial or questionable  and those whose posts are censored have little if any recourse to argue their case 
recent examples of headscratchers which led to an international uproar include facebooks removal of the iconic vietnam war photograph of phan th? kim phúc  who at just yearsold was captured on film by an associated press photographer fleeing the aftermath of an errant napalm attack near a buddhist pagoda in the village of trang bang 
that photograph helped cement in the collective american mind the horrors of the war and ultimately fueled the success of the antiwar effort  but facebook arbitrarily pulled the image for nudity  and proceeded even to ban the page of the conservative prime minister of norway for also posting the image 
ultimately the social media company reversed course in that case  but not before also taking down the equally iconic image of civil rights leader rosa parks arrest 
but taking down of the image of kim phúc might not have been simply an error of ai since it had been used as a specific example in training the teams responsible for content removal two unnamed former facebook employees told reuters  
trainers told contentmonitoring staffers that the photo violated facebook policy despite its historical significance because it depicted a naked child in distress photographed without her consent the employees told reuters 
in the final decision to reverse that censorship facebook head of the community operations division justin osofsky admitted it had been a mistake 
according to reuters  to whom many current and former facebook employees spoke on condition of anonymity the process of judging which posts deserve to be remove and which should be allowed will in certain instances be left to the discretion of a small cadre of the companys elite executives 
in addition to osofsky global policy chief monika bickert government relations chief joel kaplan vice president for public policy and communications elliot schrage and facebook chief operating officer sheryl sandberg make the final call on censorship and appeals 
all five studied at harvard and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution all but sandberg hold law degrees three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to sandberg the outlet notes chief executive mark zuckerberg also occasionally offers guidance in difficult decisions but there are others 
company spokeswoman christine chen explained facebook has a broad diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand 
for those on the receiving end of what could only be described as lopsided and inexplicable censorship recourse is generally limited and can be nearly impossible to come by often the nature of posts and pages removed insinuates political motivations on the part of the censors 
indeed and once again flaring international controversy facebook disabled  among others the accounts of editors of quds and shehab new agency  prominent palestinian media organizations  without explanation or even a specific example given for justification 
although three of four palestinianfocused accounts were restored facebook refused to comment to either reuters or the accounts owners why the decision was reversed except to say it had been an error 
in fact although chen and other facebook insiders spoke with reuters directly about contentious content removal policies and procedures many details of the processes remain covert and sorely intransparent to the public who is so often forced to cope with the consequences 
earlier this year an exposé by gizmodo showing facebooks suppression of conservative outlets via its trending topics section appeared to evidence extreme bias in favor of liberal and corporate media mainstays alternative media too which provides reports counter to the mainstream political and foreign policy paradigm has often been the subject of controversial takedowns censorship and suppressive tactics  either directly by facebook or through convoluted algorithms and artificial intelligence bots 
however considering sheryl sandberg and her loyalists populate the toplevel group deciding the fate for content removal complaints it would appear wikileaks could provide answers for both post censorship and suppression of outlets not vowing complete fealty to the preferred leftleaning narrative 
in a june   email to clinton campaign chair john podesta  an enormous cache of whose emails are still being published on a daily basis by wikileaks  penned by sandberg in response to condolences on the death of her husband states  in part 
and i still want hrc to win badly i am still here to help as i can she came over and was magical with my kids 
after a wave of post removals and temporary page bans it appears facebook has begun to come to its senses for what actually violates community standards  and what might have political worth contrary to the views of its executives 
senior members of facebooks policy team recently posted about the laxing of rules governing community standards which  though welcome  might only provide temporary relief quoted by the wall street journal  they wrote  
in the weeks ahead were going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy significant or important to the public interesteven if they might otherwise violate our standards 
while the social media giant deems itself a technology and not news platform facebook is still the bouncing off point for issues of interest for an overwhelming percentage of its users although it perhaps has some responsibility in regard to the removal of certain content putting censorship in the hands of only a few individuals in certain instances is a chilling reminder of the fragility  and grave importance  of free speech dont forget to follow the dc clothesline on facebook and twitter please help spread the word by sharing our articles on your favorite social networks share this",2016-10-31
718,ag lynch told fbi director comey not to go public with the new clinton email investigation,"posted on october   by daisy luther 
oh loretta 
ill bet that ag loretta lynch is shaking in her boots right now because when hillary clinton goes down lynchs career will go down with her heck maybe theyll even be cellmates 
loretta lynchs ties to the clintons go back to  when thenpresident bill clinton appointed her to run the brooklyn us attorneys office she left in  and went into private practice but returned to the brooklyn office in  at the behest of president barack obama  heres her official bio  
in  she was sworn in to become the rd attorney general of the united states taking the place of the blatantly corrupt attorney general eric holder  who will probably be most famous for his roles in the fast and furious operation inciting racial tensions and his mishandling of the lois lernerirs debacle first there was the secret airplane meeting with bill clinton 
it all started to publicly go downhill for lynch during the first investigation into hillary clintons carelessness with national secrets via her home email server  right before fbi director james comey was to meet with hillary clinton to interrogate her about the subject lynch was busted having a secret meeting with bill clinton  the washington post reported 
clintons private unplanned meeting with attorney general loretta e lynch at the phoenix airport last week coming at a time when the justice department should be nearing completion of its examination of hillary clintons use of a private server for her emails as secretary of state will inevitably  and negatively  affect public attitudes about that investigation 
lynch has tried to make amends though not without leaving some confusion in her wake in a conversation friday with washington post editorial writer jonathan capehart at the aspen ideas festival she insisted again that the conversation was innocent  about grandchildren and golf and such  and did not touch on the investigation of the emails but she said she recognized that others would not see it that way the fact that the meeting that i had is now casting a shadow over how people are going to view that work is something that i take seriously and deeply and painfully she said 
lynch said that she would be accepting whatever recommendation the career prosecutors and fbi director james b comey bring her  though she did not say she would remove herself completely from the case she also said she had made that decision some months ago but was only now making it public 
of course it was all much easier for lynch to abide by the decision when comey miraculously found that hillary clinton was not criminal in her negligence with national secrets 
now though people are asking questions about that illfounded meeting judicial watch has filed a lawsuit for all records related to the illicit meeting between attorney general lynch and former president bill clinton  
on june   attorney general loretta lynch is reported to have met privately with former president bill clinton on board a parked private plane at sky harbor international airport in phoenix arizona the meeting occurred during the thenongoing investigation of mrs clintons email server and mere hours before the benghazi report was released publicly involving both mrs clinton and the obama administration judicial watch filed a request on june  that the us department of justice office of the inspector general investigate that meeting 
republican presidential nominee donald trump suggested that during that meeting bill clinton may have offered to extend lynchs position in the ags office during a hillary clinton administration then she blocked a congressional investigation into the notorious iranian ransom payment 
last week ag lynch blocked a congressional investigation into the cash payments that the obama administration made to iran by pleading the fifth the washington free beacon reported 
attorney general loretta lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of congress about the obama administrations secret efforts to send iran  billion in cash earlier this year prompting accusations that lynch has pleaded the fifth amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the washington free beacon  
it is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the peoples elected representatives in congress about an important national security issue the lawmakers wrote your staff failed to address any of our questions and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue 
as the united states chief law enforcement officer it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries they stated the actions of your department come at time when iran continues to hold americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison 
how very judicial of her lynch tried to shut comey up about the new investigation into the clinton emails 
now even the mainstream media cant turn its head 
earlier i wrote about the fact that fbi director james comey made the decision on his own to go public about the new investigation into the hillary clinton emails but lets talk a little further about lynchs desperate attempts to shut him up 
the new york times reported that the justice department strongly discouraged comey against releasing the information the day before the fbi director james b comey sent a letter to congress announcing that new evidence had been discovered that might be related to the completed hillary clinton email investigation the justice department strongly discouraged the step and told him that he would be breaking with longstanding policy three law enforcement officials said on saturday senior justice department officials did not move to stop him from sending the letter officials said but they did everything short of it pointing to policies against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections 
how interesting that its seen as influencing the election to investigate someone now but it wasnt back when she was investigated and not charged im not sure exactly how that works but according to usa today emphasis mine a federal official familiar with comeys decision said saturday that the fbi director considered the attorney generals advice during a spirited discussion of the matter thursday and early friday but felt compelled to act do you remember janet reno 
poor janet was another attorney general who went down for the clintons she was also sworn in as ag under bill clinton and many questioned her appointment at the time according to a report in the chicago tribune  
she arrived in washington from miami as caesars wife and so she has remained she was ignorant and independent of insider dc and has stayed that way bill clinton never much liked her and never confided in her and she reciprocated 
she became ag just in time to take the fall for the debacle in waco  actually according to historycom 
the waco standoff had already begun by the time janet reno became the first female attorney general on march   she approved the fbis tear gas plan the following month explaining that negotiations with the branch davidians had stalemated and that the children inside the compound were at risk we will never know whether there was a better solution reno said in  everyone involved  made their best judgments based on all the information we had nonetheless a republicanled congressional report called her decision premature wrong and highly irresponsible she was also criticized when facts emerged contradicting some of her earlier statements 
the tribune post continued to discuss renos position as a scapegoat 
every day since she took office  she has been supervising at least one probe embarrassing to clintonwhitewater fundraising lewinsky china espionage etc clinton cant afford the political beating he would take if he cashiered her 
but no such attorney general could have survived the clinton scandals much less survived them with her own reputationand her departmentsintact 
attorney generals who have anything to do with the clintons dont seem to fare too well they end up so embroiled in clinton scandals that they too are pulled down into the mire regardless of what their intentions were when they started out lynch can see her futureand it has something to do with help wanted ads 
the last time lynch was involved in the clinton email kerfuffle she promised to abide by fbi director james comeys recommendation  
i wonder if shell make that same promise this time 
she really cant because if she does it will show she was complicit with the clintons the last time around and also this time when she decried comeys release of information about the investigation 
i wonder if she and hillary clinton will be able to get adjoining cells whenif the truth comes out

719,french political leader france is about to enter a holy war with islam  embrace christianity never accept the religion of satan,"posted by michael snyder 
in the world of politics the coverup is often worse than the original crime it was his role in the watergate coverup that took down richard nixon and now hillary clintons coverup of her email scandal could send her to prison for a very very long time when news broke that the fbi has renewed its investigation into hillary clintons emails  it sent shockwaves throughout the political world  but this time around we arent just talking about an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents i havent heard anyone talking about this but if the fbi discovers that hillary clinton altered destroyed or concealed any emails that should have been turned over to the fbi during the original investigation she could be charged with obstruction of justice that would immediately end her political career and if she was found guilty it could send her to prison for the rest of her life 
i have not seen a single news report mention the phrase obstruction of justice yet but i am convinced that there is a very good chance that this is where this scandal is heading the following is the relevant part of the federal statute that deals with obstruction of justice  
whoever knowingly alters destroys mutilates conceals covers up falsified or makes a false entry in any record document or tangible object with the intent to impede obstruct or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states or any case filed under title  or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case shall be fined under this title imprisoned not more than  years or both 
if hillary clinton is sent to prison for  years that would essentially be for the rest of her life 
i have a feeling that the fbi is going to find a great deal of evidence of obstruction of justice in huma abedins emails but unfortunately there is not likely to be a resolution to this matter before november th because according to the wall street journal there are approximately  emails to search through 
as federal agents prepare to scour roughly  emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of hillary clinton s email use the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the justice department over how to investigate the democratic presidential nominee 
metadata found on the laptop used by former rep anthony weiner and his estranged wife huma abedin a close clinton aide suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that mrs clinton used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter it will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are workrelated from the time ms abedin served with mrs clinton at the state department how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of investigation and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the clinton email probe 
of those  emails an inside source told fox news that  at least   would be of interest to the investigation 
at this point fbi officials have not even begun searching through the emails because a search warrant has not been secured yet the following comes from cnn  
government lawyers havent yet approached abedins lawyers to seek an agreement to conduct the search sources earlier told cnn that those discussions had begun but the law enforcement officials now say they have not 
either way government lawyers plan to seek a search warrant from a judge to conduct the search of the computer the law enforcement officials said 
but the fbi is reportedly already searching a laptop that was coowned by anthony weiner and huma abedin and no warrant was necessary for that search because weiner is cooperating with the fbi 
many have been wondering why fbi director james comey would choose to make such a bold move just over a week until election day surely he had to know that this would have a dramatic impact on the election and it is unlikely that he would have done so unless someone had already found something really big in addition comey was reportedly eager to find an opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of his peers at the fbi the following is an excerpt from a daily mail article that was written by ed klein the author of a recently released new york times bestseller about the clintons entitled  guilty as sin  
the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source a close friend who has known comey for nearly two decades shares family outings with him and accompanies him to catholic mass every week 
some people including department heads stopped talking to jim and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall said the source they felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist 
according to the source comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife patrice 
he told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom 
so what happens next 
in the most likely scenario the fbi will not have time to complete the investigation and decide whether or not to charge hillary clinton before the election this means that we would go into november th with this scandal hanging over the clinton campaign and that would seem to be very good news for donald trump 
however it is possible that once the fbi starts searching through these emails that they could come to the conclusion very rapidly that charges against clinton are warranted and if that happens we could still see some sort of announcement before election day 
in the unlikely event that does happen we could actually see hillary clinton forced out of the race before november th 
once again this appears to be very unlikely at this point but it is still possible 
if clinton was forced to step aside the democrats would need to come up with a new nominee and that process would take time in an article later today on the most important news i will reveal who i believe that nominee would be 
in such a scenario the democrats would desperately need time to get their act together and so we could actually see barack obama attempt to delay or suspend the election  the legality of such a move is highly questionable but barack obama has not allowed a little thing like the us constitution to stop him in the past 
this week is going to be exceedingly interesting  that is for sure 
the craziest election in modern american history just keeps getting crazier and i have a feeling that even more twists and turns are ahead 
it sure seems ironic that anthony weiner is playing such a central role this late in the story and i cant wait to see what is in store for the season finale

720,report exposes inner workings of facebook and how clinton loyalists control your newsfeed,"posted on october   by nathaniel mauka 
congress overwhelmingly voted for the patriot act nearly  years ago and our civil liberties have never been the same since as if this singular bill passed by george w bush wasnt invasive enough allowing big banks to demand our internet data and more  the cybersecurity information sharing act  cisa  makes cyberspying by the shadow government and the financial entities controlling it a forgone conclusion 
as with most shadow government legislation the cybersecurity information sharing act is packed with hidden surveillance allowances cisa was quietly passed to allow government to demand that private companies hand over personal information to them at will it also allows companies to mine data under the auspices of governmentcreated urgency 
the mere fact that this act passed in late  is monumental since it has been before congress in different forms for over a decade  the election seems to have offered the perfect cover as americans and activists were too busy arguing over trump vs hillary 
scott talbott senior vice president of government relations at the electronic transactions association believes the value of sharing our personal data as a means to be alerted of cyber threats outweighs any hazard to our civil liberties talbott states  
the value is that everyone can be alerted to cyber threats and take precautionary countermeasures before they materialize and spread he said before cisa corrective measures could be taken only after the cyber threat had done its damage cisa allows each company to serve as an early warning system to the entire economy 
who exactly would be determining if someone is a threat is the meat of the sandwich though cisa is ripe for abuse just as the patriot act has been 
the patriot act has made it legal for law enforcement to spy on people without probable cause  to enter their homes or even to strip search them before theyve been to court had the opportunity to argue a case or given authorities a motive for this type of interrogation 
the stated purpose of the patriot act was to deter terrorist acts in the united states but what do you do when the terrorists have already taken over your country cisa simply expands the reach of a shadow government which has already been proven to reach beyond the boundaries of constitutional law 
more importantly who specifically is cisa targeting after multiple hackers have infiltrated computer systems at the white house  the state department  the pentagon  and the office of personnel management along with the democratic national committee  and numerous multinational banks run by the cabal is the shadow government simply trying to create a stopgap before their most elusive yet damning information is made public 
cisa certainly will expand the reach of government surveillance on citizens as it has been conducted by the the national security agency nsa before former nsa contractor edward snowden exposed it 
i think this bill was meant to be a surveillance bill from the start said justin harvey cso of fidelis cybersecurity adding that he is dubious that the stated intent of the bill  to use collective intelligence to warn of potential cyber attacks and possibly stop them before they occur  will result 
under the guise of sharing cyber threats cisa allows companies to wholesalecollect information that may not even be a threat  and then pass it along for government bodies to determine if it is indeed a threat if this sounds like circular logic  it is just the beginning of the odd verbiage within the bill its justifications for entering every possible orifice for datagathering are more confounded than an octopus in a straight jacket

721,if clinton goes down loretta lynch will go down with her,"michael snyder 
in the world of politics the coverup is often worse than the original crime it was his role in the watergate coverup that took down richard nixon and now hillary clintons coverup of her email scandal could send her to prison for a very very long time when news broke that the fbi has renewed its investigation into hillary clintons emails  it sent shockwaves throughout the political world  but this time around we arent just talking about an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents i havent heard anyone talking about this but if the fbi discovers that hillary clinton altered destroyed or concealed any emails that should have been turned over to the fbi during the original investigation she could be charged with obstruction of justice that would immediately end her political career and if she was found guilty it could send her to prison for the rest of her life 
i have not seen a single news report mention the phrase obstruction of justice yet but i am convinced that there is a very good chance that this is where this scandal is heading the following is the relevant part of the federal statute that deals with obstruction of justice  
whoever knowingly alters destroys mutilates conceals covers up falsified or makes a false entry in any record document or tangible object with the intent to impede obstruct or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states or any case filed under title  or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case shall be fined under this title imprisoned not more than  years or both 
if hillary clinton is sent to prison for  years that would essentially be for the rest of her life 
i have a feeling that the fbi is going to find a great deal of evidence of obstruction of justice in huma abedins emails but unfortunately there is not likely to be a resolution to this matter before november th because according to the wall street journal there are approximately  emails to search through 
as federal agents prepare to scour roughly  emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of hillary clinton s email use the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the justice department over how to investigate the democratic presidential nominee 
metadata found on the laptop used by former rep anthony weiner and his estranged wife huma abedin a close clinton aide suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that mrs clinton used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter it will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are workrelated from the time ms abedin served with mrs clinton at the state department how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of investigation and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the clinton email probe 
of those  emails an inside source told fox news that  at least   would be of interest to the investigation 
at this point fbi officials have not even begun searching through the emails because a search warrant has not been secured yet the following comes from cnn  
government lawyers havent yet approached abedins lawyers to seek an agreement to conduct the search sources earlier told cnn that those discussions had begun but the law enforcement officials now say they have not 
either way government lawyers plan to seek a search warrant from a judge to conduct the search of the computer the law enforcement officials said 
but the fbi is reportedly already searching a laptop that was coowned by anthony weiner and huma abedin and no warrant was necessary for that search because weiner is cooperating with the fbi 
many have been wondering why fbi director james comey would choose to make such a bold move just over a week until election day surely he had to know that this would have a dramatic impact on the election and it is unlikely that he would have done so unless someone had already found something really big in addition comey was reportedly eager to find an opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of his peers at the fbi the following is an excerpt from a daily mail article that was written by ed klein the author of a recently released new york times bestseller about the clintons entitled  guilty as sin  
the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source a close friend who has known comey for nearly two decades shares family outings with him and accompanies him to catholic mass every week 
some people including department heads stopped talking to jim and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall said the source they felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist 
according to the source comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife patrice 
he told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom 
so what happens next 
in the most likely scenario the fbi will not have time to complete the investigation and decide whether or not to charge hillary clinton before the election this means that we would go into november th with this scandal hanging over the clinton campaign and that would seem to be very good news for donald trump 
however it is possible that once the fbi starts searching through these emails that they could come to the conclusion very rapidly that charges against clinton are warranted and if that happens we could still see some sort of announcement before election day 
in the unlikely event that does happen we could actually see hillary clinton forced out of the race before november th 
once again this appears to be very unlikely at this point but it is still possible 
if clinton was forced to step aside the democrats would need to come up with a new nominee and that process would take time in an article later today on the most important news i will reveal who i believe that nominee would be 
in such a scenario the democrats would desperately need time to get their act together and so we could actually see barack obama attempt to delay or suspend the election  the legality of such a move is highly questionable but barack obama has not allowed a little thing like the us constitution to stop him in the past 
this week is going to be exceedingly interesting  that is for sure 
the craziest election in modern american history just keeps getting crazier and i have a feeling that even more twists and turns are ahead 
it sure seems ironic that anthony weiner is playing such a central role this late in the story and i cant wait to see what is in store for the season finale

722,if hillary clinton is charged with obstruction of justice she could go to prison for  years,"claire bernish 
censorship by facebook has become a thorn in the side of nearly anyone with an opinion differing from the narrative touted by the corporate press  for instance sentiments not praising hillary clinton  and now through both a new report from reuters and emails published by wikileaks we have insight into why certain posts are targeted 
facebook relies on a combination of artificial intelligence and human judgment to remove posts deemed offensive violent or otherwise unacceptable to its community standards  but precisely how the ultimate call to take down posts pages and groups are made remains unknown 
and facebook takedowns no matter the improvements to the process the social media behemoth claims to make have been no less controversial or questionable  and those whose posts are censored have little if any recourse to argue their case 
recent examples of headscratchers which led to an international uproar include facebooks removal of the iconic vietnam war photograph of phan th? kim phúc  who at just yearsold was captured on film by an associated press photographer fleeing the aftermath of an errant napalm attack near a buddhist pagoda in the village of trang bang 
that photograph helped cement in the collective american mind the horrors of the war and ultimately fueled the success of the antiwar effort  but facebook arbitrarily pulled the image for nudity  and proceeded even to ban the page of the conservative prime minister of norway for also posting the image 
ultimately the social media company reversed course in that case  but not before also taking down the equally iconic image of civil rights leader rosa parks arrest 
but taking down of the image of kim phúc might not have been simply an error of ai since it had been used as a specific example in training the teams responsible for content removal two unnamed former facebook employees told reuters  
trainers told contentmonitoring staffers that the photo violated facebook policy despite its historical significance because it depicted a naked child in distress photographed without her consent the employees told reuters 
in the final decision to reverse that censorship facebook head of the community operations division justin osofsky admitted it had been a mistake 
according to reuters  to whom many current and former facebook employees spoke on condition of anonymity the process of judging which posts deserve to be remove and which should be allowed will in certain instances be left to the discretion of a small cadre of the companys elite executives 
in addition to osofsky global policy chief monika bickert government relations chief joel kaplan vice president for public policy and communications elliot schrage and facebook chief operating officer sheryl sandberg make the final call on censorship and appeals 
all five studied at harvard and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution all but sandberg hold law degrees three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to sandberg the outlet notes chief executive mark zuckerberg also occasionally offers guidance in difficult decisions but there are others 
company spokeswoman christine chen explained facebook has a broad diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand 
for those on the receiving end of what could only be described as lopsided and inexplicable censorship recourse is generally limited and can be nearly impossible to come by often the nature of posts and pages removed insinuates political motivations on the part of the censors 
indeed and once again flaring international controversy facebook disabled  among others the accounts of editors of quds and shehab new agency  prominent palestinian media organizations  without explanation or even a specific example given for justification 
although three of four palestinianfocused accounts were restored facebook refused to comment to either reuters or the accounts owners why the decision was reversed except to say it had been an error 
in fact although chen and other facebook insiders spoke with reuters directly about contentious content removal policies and procedures many details of the processes remain covert and sorely intransparent to the public who is so often forced to cope with the consequences 
earlier this year an exposé by gizmodo showing facebooks suppression of conservative outlets via its trending topics section appeared to evidence extreme bias in favor of liberal and corporate media mainstays alternative media too which provides reports counter to the mainstream political and foreign policy paradigm has often been the subject of controversial takedowns censorship and suppressive tactics  either directly by facebook or through convoluted algorithms and artificial intelligence bots 
however considering sheryl sandberg and her loyalists populate the toplevel group deciding the fate for content removal complaints it would appear wikileaks could provide answers for both post censorship and suppression of outlets not vowing complete fealty to the preferred leftleaning narrative 
in a june   email to clinton campaign chair john podesta  an enormous cache of whose emails are still being published on a daily basis by wikileaks  penned by sandberg in response to condolences on the death of her husband states  in part 
and i still want hrc to win badly i am still here to help as i can she came over and was magical with my kids 
after a wave of post removals and temporary page bans it appears facebook has begun to come to its senses for what actually violates community standards  and what might have political worth contrary to the views of its executives 
senior members of facebooks policy team recently posted about the laxing of rules governing community standards which  though welcome  might only provide temporary relief quoted by the wall street journal  they wrote  
in the weeks ahead were going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy significant or important to the public interesteven if they might otherwise violate our standards 
while the social media giant deems itself a technology and not news platform facebook is still the bouncing off point for issues of interest for an overwhelming percentage of its users although it perhaps has some responsibility in regard to the removal of certain content putting censorship in the hands of only a few individuals in certain instances is a chilling reminder of the fragility  and grave importance  of free speech",2016-10-31
723,distracted by election  noone resisted the deep states patriot act,"michael snyder 
i realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately  emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and her estranged husband anthony weiner now that the fbi is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge hillary clinton with a crime could be made by november th of course the most likely scenario is that hillary clinton will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the clinton campaign but if the fbi does quickly take action it is possible that hillary clinton could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate 
in fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for clinton to willingly remove herself from the race for example the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled  democrats should ask clinton to step aside  
so what should the democrats do now 
if ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process 
they would demand that mrs clinton step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee sen tim kaine of virginia stand in her place 
democrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her homebrew email server from the time she was secretary of state having clinton anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea 
but what the author of that article does not understand is that tim kaine would not automatically take her place if clinton steps down before the election in a previous article  i included a quote from a us news  world report article that explained what would happen if hillary clinton was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november th 
if clinton were to fall off the ticket democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boatrocking socialist sen bernie sanders of vermont 
dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are  committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold  spots for selection by states along with an optional  slots dnc members can choose to fill 
but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed 
so if this email scandal forced hillary clinton to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee 
who would they choose 
lets take a look at the top five options 
 tim kaine 
he would seem to be an obvious choice since he is hillary clintons running mate but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him 
and at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail in fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens 
so to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee 
 joe biden 
vicepresident joe biden has far more name recognition than tim kaine does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run  
vice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it 
biden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was reopening their criminal probe into clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state made him secondguess his decision last year not to run 
but according to the vice president the short answer is no the only thing that kept him from running biden said was the recent death of his son beau 
unfortunately for biden he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does 
biden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesnt have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers 
biden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats but he might not be a winning choice 
 bernie sanders 
bernie sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runnerup to hillary clinton but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against bernie sanders 
first of all he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats he has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over 
secondly the democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this 
thirdly democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election 
so even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list 
 elizabeth warren 
elizabeth warren would be very popular with the bernie sanders wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace hillary clinton with another woman 
so she is definitely a possibility 
but she does lack name recognition and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies 
 michelle obama 
one recent survey found that  percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for hillary clinton 
and these days barack obamas approval rating is running anywhere from  to  
so the thought of another obama in the white house is not as farfetched as you might think 
michelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very wellliked by the american people and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently for instance her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the  campaign in a recent msn article entitled  in this campaign michelle obama became more than just another political voice  
the speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented obamas place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority three months before leaving the white house she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title 
when you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry said anita mcbride former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university we know she didnt like politics but she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out people listen to her 
if i were the democrats michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump 
of course the obamas are just as radical as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point 
and i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if hillary clinton has to step aside because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her 
in the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force hillary clinton out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen 
and if it does happen it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down

on friday the fbi announced an investigation into newly leaked emails linked to hillary clinton in a surprising twist the new leaked emails from the private email server were discovered after the fbi confiscated electronic devices belonging to top aide huma abedin her controversial and perverted husband anthony weiner 
officially the federal law enforcement agents are opening an investigation into weiner texting a yearold in north carolina and according to director comey the fbi were taking steps to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation 
shortly after the announcement donald trump utilized the situation to advantage and running theme of clintons corruption at a rally in new hampshire supporters nearly cheered in complete unison lock her up 
hillary clintons corruption is on a scale we have never seen before we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the oval office said trump to the roaring crowd 
i have great respect for the fact that the fbi and the doj are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made mr trump said referring also to the department of justice this was a grave miscarriage of justice that the american people fully understand it is everybodys hope that it is about to be corrected 
the fbis decision to reopen their criminal investigation into hillary clintons secret email server just  days before the election shows how serious this discovery must be reince priebus the republican committee chairman said in a statement this stunning development raises serious questions about what records may not have been turned over and why and whether they show intent to violate the law

taking states that the media has tried to downplay as if trump has no chance to win them dml shows how trump not only has a chance but predicts he will win these states and he backs up his prediction with solid data and facts 
dml also clarified that the polls are extremely misleading he said trump has lit a spark in people who have not voted in decades  some who have never voted  but now they are embracing trump these people are not being included in the polls 
early voting is also not a true representation of whats about to happen because more democrats tend to show up for early voting while the majority of republicans wait until election day 
watch this eyeopening video for a critical statebystate analysis that proves trump can easily win the election  then share it everywhere 
note in the video when dml talks about pa voting for trump he forgot to mention k democrats in pa switched parties over the past year in addition pa saw an eyepopping number of new voters register as republicans combined pa in this election has  more republicans than it did in

according to the department of homeland security in fiscal  the border patrol apprehended  immigrants from central america almost onethird of all apprehensions borderwide  and  more than during the socalled surge of  the agency also apprehended  haitians up from just  last year the number of immigrants claiming to be from africa and asia also is up 

when you stop somebody you ask their name and the first thing they tell you is  im here for asylum i cant go home because theyll kill me  when it takes a good five or six minutes just to get their name out of them they have a rehearsed story said chris cabrera a representative from the border patrol council told fox news once they get those papers saying they can pass through our checkpoint well never see them again 
typically an illegal immigrant pays a  to  smuggling fee to the drug cartels once here he said the mexican government had given each a number based on their arrival

734,dml provides stunning analysis predicts trump will win presidential election,"by dean daniels  november    politics  
in the summer of  before the current presidential race ignited and two weeks before trump announced his candidacy dml gave a compelling speech during his tour in the state of massachusetts in front of an audience at a small town synagogue the awardwinning businessman and conservative commentator laid out the key component that he believed would catapult any presidential candidate above all the others putting americans first 
dml emphasizes during his americans first speech that the number one issue in america is immigration he explains in crystal clear detail how immigration both legal and illegal goes beyond party identification he says its not a democrat or republican issue  its an american issue 
having traveled the country by car exploring the idea of running for president himself dml got a real sense for what concerned americans most therefore he knew before the rest of us that the ideal candidate of  would be someone who has the audacity and the courage to tell the american people he or she will commit to the deportation of illegal immigrants 
remember its not an antiimmigration its an antiillegal immigration and its about being proamerica 
while putting americans first would have been dmls campaign theme had he chosen to run for the highest office in the land this strategy was instead adopted by none other than donald jtrump this is one major reason why dml has supported trump since day one 
trump has done more than proven dml correct trump has proven how powerful the  americans first ideology is during a day and age when progressive politicians like barack obama and hillary clinton are catering to foreign workers and corporate donors at the expense of the american people who are left to rot on the back burner 
watch an excerpt from the speech and then check out dmls electoral map and how he sees trump winning on tuesday

with tears rolling down her face cyrus says so probably like most peoplewell maybe not because given the resultmaybe i really am different and maybe a lot of people that im surrounded by think with open minds and open hearts like i do and i do want to say that ive been very vocal for my support for everyone besides donald trump heavily supported bernie heavily supported hillary and i still think that in her lifetime she deserves to be the first female president and thats what makes me so sad 
i just wish that she had that opportunity because she fought for so long and because i believe her when she says that she loves this country this is all shes ever done shes given her life to make it better but like donald trump so ironically played after his speech it said you cant always get what you want and happy hippies we adjust and we accept everyone for who they are and so donald trump i accept you she said and this hurts to say but i even accept you as the president of the united states and thats finebecause i think now i want to be hopeful 
she then went on to thank barack obama for everything he has done the past eight years and thanked hillary for inspiring us

didheres  huge lies from the debate fisher  mins ago news comments off on hillary insisted america fact check her so we didheres  huge lies from the debate hillary insisted america fact check her so we didheres  huge lies from the debate hillary clinton stood before millions of americans last night and told numerous lies then said things like google it suggesting we fact check herso we did and found  major lies plus others fact check   hillary clinton claimed that planned parenthood provides cancer screenings and therefore should not be defunded in spite of controversy about abortion factcheck mostly false this is a repeated claim deployed in defense of planned parenthood but it is not true at least as regards breast cancer as the leftleaning washington post s factchecker wrote in  when democratic lawmakers or other supporters assert that planned parenthood provides mammograms this is highly misleading language because it could be interpreted to mean that the group directly administers the xrays the group does not provide mammograms rather the situation is similar to other clinics where patients are referred to a licensed facility that can provide biopsies xrays or other specialized services it is slightly more accurate to say that women have access to mammograms via planned parenthood though its still slippery language fact check   hillary clinton responded to a question about supreme court and gun rights by saying i support the second amendment factcheck false when clinton made this statement she was responding to a question about the district of columbia v heller  decision a decision dealing with the foundations of the second amendment the very roots of what it protects in the heller ruling scotus reaffirmed that the second amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms this decision has become a bulwark against leftists who have spent decades in academia politics and journalism trying to persuade americans that the second amendment protects a collective right if collective the left could tie gun ownership to service in the militia and bar gun ownership for anyone save those who serve in the militia or todays military or police forces so heller is crucial in fact it is so crucial that it is not be a stretch to say the entire second amendment rests on it yet hillary disagrees the heller ruling her spokesman josh schwerin said hillary believes heller was  wrongly decided  so how can a woman who does not believe in an individual right to keep and bear arms support the second amendment she cant incidentally clinton made this point evident during the debate when she said her disagreement with the heller decision was the way the scotus applied the second amendment in that case for those of you who may not know heller centered on washington dcs gun banwhich was subsequently struck down via the scotus decision to oppose the application of the second amendment in heller is to oppose the fact that a gun ban was overturned that is not supporting the second amendment fact check   hillary clinton said during the third presidential debate in las vegas on wednesday that she will not add a penny to the debt if elected president factcheck false indeed hillary clintons claim is not even close to true the committee for a responsible federal budget predicts that under clintons policies  the debt would increase by  trillion over a decade clintons plan would increase both spending and revenue the washington dcbased independent nonprofits analyst said  under our preliminary updated central estimate she would increase primary spending by  trillion over the next decade including about  billion of spending on college education  billion each on paid family leave and infrastructure and significant new healthrelated spending fact check   hillary clinton claimed that  people a yeardie from guns factcheck false this is a claim clinton often makes to make gun violence appear to be raging out of control to justify the government stepping in with more rules and regulations to keep the american people safe however a factcheck shows clintons claim is not only false but is exaggerated by  percent she is using figures from  and reporting them in a way that distorts what really happened with guns that year clinton first began making this claim in november  repeated it in april  and has since repeated it again and again in april breitbart news highlighted the method clinton used to swell the numbers in  the centers for disease control and prevention cdc reported  firearmrelated homicides in the united states an additional  accidental firearmrelated deaths occurred in the usa figure that pales in comparison to the  deaths by accidental poisoning or the  deaths caused by falls so clinton and gun control proponents who think like her increase these figures by adding in suicides in this way  firearmrelated deathshomicides and accidental deathsquickly become  gun violence deaths in  and an impetus for gun control fact check   hillary clinton praised president obama s economic performance adding he has cut the deficit by twothirds factcheck false this repeated democratic canard relies on fraudulent accounting that only starts more than halfway through obama s first year in office after the  billion stimulus the massive omnibus spending bill porkulus and the deployment of the troubled asset relief program tarp which was signed by obama s predecessor but for which he voted as breitbart news noted when president obama claimed in january to have cut the deficit by almost threequarters this is pure fiction obama has doubled the national debt and its not because he cut the deficit rather he spent staggering amounts of money in his first months in officewhich he assigns dishonestly to the previous fiscal year under george w bush he cut ie spent more gradually from that spending but only under protest after republicans took the house in  the truth is that obama vastly expanded the deficit in a doomed and illconceived experiment in keynesian stimulus spending much of which was wasted on priorities that helped obama s political supporters  especially the public sector unions  but did little for the economy fact check   hillary clinton said we at the clinton foundation spend ninety percent  ninety percent  of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country factcheck false indeed clintons ninety percent claim is false according to her troubled charitys own t ax filings  peter schweizer president of the government accountability institute  breitbart news senior editoratlarge and author of clinton cash said the clinton foundation has spent as little as six percent of its total income on actual charitable endeavors if you actually look at the numbers of their filings and s thats what it indicates schweizer said last month in an interview with siriusxm host alex marlow on breitbart news daily  the clinton foundation will say we assisted or facilitated in  kids getting immunizations well okay what does that mean and they dont really tell you they dont really explain to you how it works so the number is absolutely correct that six percent goes to other charities schweizer continued the other  percent is in this stew of marketing and management and travel expenses and sort of all these obscure things that its really hard to dissect what is the end result of that  percent being spent whats more political analyst sean davis the cofounder of the federalist and a former adviser to sen tom coburn and gov rick perry examined the clinton foundations  tax filings and found that  hillary clintons nonprofit spent more on office supplies and rent than it did on charitable grants the clinton foundation spent nearly  million percent of all  expenditureson travel davis contends  nearly  million percent of all expenditureswas spent on office supplies source check out over  more fact checks at breitbart so there you have it folks it was hard to narrow it down to just  but these were among the biggest lies of the night,2016-11-21

as new revelations continue to unfold regarding hillary s time as secretary of state it has become clear that her state department was highly influenced by donors to the clinton foundation before hillary became secretary of state she had to sign an agreement with the obama administration restricting the ability of the clinton foundation to accept foreign donations in february of this year the clinton foundation admitted that the agreement had in fact been broken 
now it has been discovered that over half of nongovernment officials who met with hillary while she was secretary of state gave money to the clinton foundation what they received in return is just one of the questions hillary has refused to answer byavoiding the press for the past eight months in newly released emails there are details of donors being granted access to ambassadors due to their interest in the region the foundation putting pressure on hillary s staff to hire a former employee and the clinton global initiative leader demanding a top foundation donor be connected with the state department 
this is beyond the appearance of a conflict and americans have seen through the facade a majority of voters say they believe clinton gave special treatment to foundation donors while she was secretary of state as the president of judicial watch accurately pointed out there was no daylight between the two under mrs clinton and this was contrary to her promises 
after ignoring previous ethics guidelines the clintons are now trying to reassure americans by saying the foundation will change if hillary is elected the last ditch effort to gloss over ethics violations and possibly cover up corruption within hillary s state department is much too little and far too late americans are tired of being lied to by the clintons since the american people have a right to a full view of hillary s record before they head to the polls the clinton foundation should immediately release all of hillary s state department emails",2016-11-25

schumer took the stage afterward for her first standup gig since hundreds of supporters of republican candidate donald trump stood up and walked out of her performance in tampa florida earlier this week after the comedian called him an orange monster as breitbart previously reported shumer was widely booed during the performance at tampas amalie arena where she instructed security to remove hecklers 
during her performance tuesday night schumer read aloud a letter she composed in response to the trump fans who walked out on her show in tampa 
dearest tampa im sorry you didnt want me a comedian who talks about what she believes in to mention the biggest thing going on in our country right now schumer said adding how could i think it was ok to spend five minutes having a peaceful conversation with someone with different views after the show i want you to know that i will go straight to a rehab facility 
the comedian added that she looks forward to putting this all behind us in november when  hillary clinton is our motherfcking president

but if we could get some business done in a light way its worth trying signaling that she is more than fine with them making their way into the public domain because past the process stuff next phase is content and the assumption is that she did this secretly hiding etc simply not true we cant jam state to release them at this point but if dan can think of a light way to say i am proud of the work we did at state and hopefully at some point everyone will be able to read whats in them as a way to better understand that work but until then i want to talk about doesnt need to be at the top could be at some natural point

two time academy award winning actor denzel washington has been at the top of hollywoods a list since his breakthrough role in the stirring civil war film glory  
hes the type of actor who you can imagine as being down to earth off screen as he abides by his deep christian faith and is never caught doing trashy behavior like so many others in liberal hollywood 
it shouldnt be a huge surprise to us then that denzel would turn against braindead liberals in hollywood and support our presidentelect donald trump  
washington praised trump at the expense of jobdestroyer barack obama recently saying we need more and more jobs hes hired more employees more people than anyone i know in the world 
washington has stated that he feels a personal face along with god and he is thrilled that the republican party with its strong christian values has returned to power in our country do you agree with denzel washington",2016-11-01

these days it has most certainly become chic for the modern liberal to throw about accusations of racism although this type of racebaiting has been going on for a number of years now it became more noticeable during the  us presidential election when these liberals accuse donald trump of being racist they had better be careful for one specific reason 
a leaked video from  shows that during president obama s first campaign he was also concerned about border security and he even suggested a wall now there is just one dominant question anti trump individuals need to digest 
is obama a racist too because he was talking about some things you could easily accuse trump of lets play a quick game if you didnt know who said this would you think it was donald trump in  or barack obama in  
this mans core goal was to preserve the integrity of our borders to reduce illegal immigration does this sound like trump or obama  
how about this one this man said additional fencing could help get our border under control definitely sounds more like a gop candidate than a democrat one thats for sure 
finally this man also supported additional personnel infrastructure and technology on our border and at ports of entry liberals would love to claim these quotes came from donald j trump  especially considering he is the villain du jour in their lives at the moment 
i hate to steal their thunder but these quotes did indeed come from a young barack obama in  even he understood the need for a controlled border before the special interests in this country got to him 
so it is one thing when leaked videos show hillary clinton believed border security was important it was entirely another when they showed that her husband thought it was important but when liberal idol barack obama says it say it isnt so liberals just cant handle that 
but anyway folks it is all about platforms im sure you have learned by now that donald trump doesnt get the free pass other politicians in this country enjoy first of all he is a conservative so he is already someone every liberal loves to hate 
republicans have been so badly demonized in this country simply for desiring to get it under control luckily people saw through the propaganda and decided that obama s brand was simply not working any longer 
people are fed up with politicians who say one thing and do another if you are looking for a reason why donald trump is the new president and not hillary clinton there you go",2016-11-06

827,sicher trainieren beim spinning gilt ab sofort helmpflicht,"posted on october   by admin 
by vekar 
one thing i have yet to see anyone bring up is how this election could be bait and switch at the last minute in order to understand this however i need to explain the unique possibilities the nwo has created with these two candidates and how this is in fact a very old card from the s 
first we have trump everyone loves trump because trump is not hillary therefore he must be better it is an argument based on the following stalin killed  million and one while mao killed  million and two so stalin is better than mao trump is outright the lets go back to sleep candidate hillary is not already i have seen and heard more than enough about how if only trump goes in then at least four more years have been bought and the nation will survive juts four more years 
from the so called militia and patriots at awrm and the intelligence report they yammer that if only trump goes in then we can postpone the coming war or buy ourselves more time to prepare after all they claim time favors us not the enemy all this bearing in mind that trump has gone back on his word many times changed his mind flip flopped on illegals wants a bigger police state is the most hated in the media etc now lets compare the next runner up quickly 
hillary it is currently chic to hate hillary youre not in style if you like her she will end the nation doom the world and so on never mind that both trump and hillary were put up by the nwo you are not allowed to run otherwise this is old news she is going to cause more war she is a liar cheat she betrayed the nation etc yet both her and trump met with netanyahu behind closed doors and apparently received his blessing to proceed it is a trap and we should all know it and see it clearly she is also the darling of the media 
both of them have in common the s rise to power theme of lenin and hitler both take after these two for both nations germany and russia were in collapse or outright collapsed debauchery was the rule as well as corruption hillary is like lenin she is going in red banners flying and the cheka on her heels to remove any undesirables she is going to finish the job and push the agenda to the hilt even if it takes war to do it trump on the other hand is following hitlers script offering hope without promising anything except a bigger government more powerful police state etc trump will also see the plan to fruition but there is a subtle nuance between these two one is offering to do it with an iron fist in a velvet glove the other is simply the iron fist 
now comes the problem people are not seeing if they force hillary in despite all the public outrage then we know for a fact they have reached a level of preparation that is adequate to dealing with public backlash even insurrection should it be minor or full if they put trump in then they are taking the back street approach because they have not gathered the resources yet to put us down and need to put someone in who will quiet the public just like obama did for a time this election is about purchasing time nothing more nothing less 
if trump is put in then already we can see that most are going straight back to bed and not getting up for another four years at minimum maybe eight the militias and other patriot groups will declare a partial victory and that they can bury their guns again and whistle dixie they are mortified of having to take action so trump is their obvious choice hillary on the other hand represents that steamroller coming down the hill at full tilt they do not want that and seek to avoid it rather than fight it the reality is time does not favor us here time favors the enemy if time favored us then we would not be here diminished and in dire straits imagine how much could have been avoided had the militia stood up during waco again time favored the enemy ruby ridge time favored the enemy as they whittle away and build their power base up bit by bit they are not fools 
consider those two possibilities then consider this if trump goes in and goes along with the war with russia if indeed that is the plan for ww they laid out more than sixity years ago admittedly people are far more willing to join trumps army and go fight than they would hillary something else to consider is perhaps they want a second civil war put hillary in knowing it will cause an insurrection fake one which we know they can do have trump reluctantly take the reins and like davis lead the way in marching the fools single file into the enemy guns just like the first one causing mass casualties for nothing a second civil war of this sort would favor the enemy for it would absolutely end the nation but who would fight for hillary oh right thats why they are bringing in all those foreigners and foreign troops just change the uniform quickly and voila some would suggest this would favor the american nationals not really rather than fight intelligently for the bill of rights they would be fighting for trump they would be fighting to bleed us dry like the confederates did in the civil war fighting by the rules and it cost them dearly only by fighting by our own rules can we win trump would allow them to guide the slaughter one way or another all the while weakening us remember the end game is to destroy absolutely the last vestiges of americans and our culture whatever may be left of it which is not much if anything 
perhaps the above is where those warning about the coming breakup of america will occur perhaps perhaps not but they now have the option to do so i want you to think on all this and let your mind run wild with other possibilities but just remember that they are right now lining the ducks up you while the firing squad is forming up and loading their rifles no matter what you believe will be the outcome of this and no matter what happens one way or another know that this is all preplanned and they would never allow this situation unless they had a humdinger of a plan hidden just beneath the surface i hope i scratched that surface for you like you they have a plan a b c and d it is why they have succeeded for more than two centuries do not take them for the fool they have proven they are not 
so maybe we will get trump and the populace will quiet down while the communists march on with a different uniform cheka versus gestapo then again hillary might go in and just finish things and be done with it or prep the nation for the next phase no matter what happens be ready for it and do not let them sucker you into believing this honest or that trump is honest they are both in on it together they merely represent two different paths for them to reach their ultimate goal share this",2016-11-21

834,plane carrying pence skids off runway at laguardia airport,yahoo news portland ore ap  a jury delivered an extraordinary blow to the government thursday in a longrunning battle over the use of public lands when it acquitted all seven defendants involved in the armed occupation of a national wildlife refuge in rural southeastern oregon tumult erupted in the courtroom after the verdicts were read when an attorney for group leader ammon bundy demanded his client be immediately released repeatedly yelling at the judge us marshals tackled attorney marcus mumford to the ground used a stun gun on him several times and arrested him us district judge anna brown said she could not release bundy because he still faces charges in nevada stemming from an armed standoff at his father cliven bundys ranch two years ago the portland jury acquitted bundy his brother ryan bundy and five others of conspiring to impede federal workers from their jobs at the malheur national wildlife refuge  miles southeast of portland even attorneys for the defendants were surprised by the acquittals its stunning its a stunning victory for the defense said robert salisbury attorney for defendant jeff banta im speechless said defendant neil wampler this is a tremendous victory for rural america and it is a welldeserved overwhelming defeat for a corrupt and predatory federal government the us attorney in oregon billy j williams issued a statement defending the decision to bring charges against the seven defendants we strongly believe that this case needed to be brought before a court publicly tried and decided by a jury a bundy daughter bailey logue said family members were savoring the victory and would begin friday to determine their next step first thing were going to get down on our knees and thank our heavenly father and were going to enjoy our families logue said tomorrow were going to figure out what were going to do next messages left for bundy family matriarch carol bundy in bunkerville nevada werent immediately returned the oregon case is a continuation of the tense standoff with federal officials at cliven bundys ranch in  cliven ammon and ryan bundy are among those who are to go on trial in nevada early next year for that standoff while the charges in oregon accused defendants of preventing federal workers from getting to their workplace the case in nevada revolves around allegations of a more direct threat an armed standoff involving dozens of bundy backers pointing weapons including assaultstyle rifles at federal bureau of land management agents and contract cowboys rounding up cattle near the bundy ranch outside bunkerville daniel hill attorney for ammon bundy in the nevada case said he believed the acquittal in oregon bodes well for his client and the other defendants facing felony weapon conspiracy and other charges when the jury here hears the whole story i expect the same result hill told the associated press in las vegas hill also said hell seek his clients release from federal custody pending trial in nevada ammon bundy and his followers took over the oregon bird sanctuary on jan  they objected to prison sentences handed down to dwight and steven hammond two local ranchers convicted of setting fires they demanded the government free the father and son and relinquish control of public lands to local officials the bundys and other key figures were arrested in a jan  traffic stop outside the refuge that ended with police fatally shooting robert lavoy finicum an occupation spokesman most occupiers left after his death but four holdouts remained until feb  when they surrendered following a lengthy negotiation federal prosecutors took two weeks to present their case finishing with a display of more than  guns seized after the standoff an fbi agent testified that  live rounds and nearly  spent casings were found during trial bundy testified that the plan was to take ownership of the refuge by occupying it for a period of time and then turn it over to local officials to use as they saw fit bundy also testified that the occupiers carried guns because they would have been arrested immediately otherwise and to protect themselves against possible government attack the bird sanctuary takeover drew sympathizers from around the west it also drew a few protesters who were upset that the armed occupation was preventing others from using the land they included kieran suckling executive director of the center for biological diversity suckling on thursday called the acquittals extremely disturbing for anyone who cares about americas public lands the rights of native people and their heritage and a political system that refuses to be bullied by violence and racism the bundy clan and their followers peddle a dangerous brand of radicalism aimed at taking over lands owned by all of us i worry this verdict only emboldens the kind of intimidation and rightwing violence that underpins their movement suckling said one of ammon bundys attorneys morgan philpot had a different perspective after watching mumford get tackled by marshals his liberty was just assaulted by the very government that was supposed to protect it by the very government that just prosecuted his client  unjustly as the jury found theres another oregon trial coming up over the wildlife refuge authorities had charged  occupiers with conspiracy eleven pleaded guilty and another had the charge dropped seven defendants chose not to be tried at this time their trial is scheduled to begin feb,2016-10-28

earlier thursday standing on his porch to have his morning coffee he said he doesnt much see the sense of blocking the  billion oil pipeline under construction through four states by energy transfer partners of dallas texas it cuts a swath of freshlyturned ground just a mile from his house 
the construction is protected by razor wire on a highway overpass a reminder of the protests that have drawn international attention about a half hour from wresslers house near the standing rock sioux reservation 
they aint bothered us here in st anthony wressler said but im afraid something is going to happen for the worst if they are not going to move and they are going to get moved he said of protesters now encamped in the path of construction he said the sheriff should have taken a stronger stance from the beginning but who knows 
north dakota needs the pipeline he said as a former steel worker he knows the value of the oil industry 
during the first boom in  we made tanks and more oil tanks and more tanks today what good is oil to north dakota if we cant send it somewhere what do we want to get it from the arabs we see how many problems that gave us 
its been a good life wressler said in this faded town that used to have two schools a lumber yard grocery store and a post office the bigger town of mandan up the road sucked off the jobs and population but he values the roots he feels deep in this ground his father used to work in the shed next to his wresslers house as a blacksmith fixing farmers tools he pounded and fixed everything until they moved to throwaway scythes throwaway everything 
wresslers red plaid flannel shirt with white plastic pearl snaps was all he needed to be comfortable on this fall morning everybody wanted an early winter the pipeline people wanted it so the indians would leave the indians wanted it so they couldnt put in the pipeline instead weve got this

the dakota access pipeline slicing through four states of the u s also creates smalltown divisions where some business owners near the protest camp have plenty to say on the subject they declined to give their names publicly though for fear of sending away customers

for instance a nonindian garage owner is married to a sioux woman who sides with the opponents  while he finds the whole controversy a nuisance

a large map with the slogan pray for the redoubt hangs behind the till at warren campbells army surplus store located just outside coeur dalene idaho 
campbell moved his family from california about a year and a half ago in part because he believes the us economy is on the verge of collapse but also to get more god and less government in his life and to live around likeminded people 
the american redoubt is a stronghold its the last bastion for god country liberty constitution second amendment and home schooling he said warren campbell inside his army surplus store redoubt surplus and tactical near coeur dalene idaho erin collinscbc 
a redoubt is a littleused military term that refers to a temporary fortification the american redoubt is both a movement and an unofficial geographic zone that includes idaho wyoming montana and the eastern parts of washington and oregon 
the term was coined in  by survivalist james wesley rawles who identified the region as the best place to wait out a disaster in the us be it natural economic or political 
rawles sees the redoubt as a place where mostly conservative christian americans who are worried about the future should move and prepare for the worst the goal is to create a safe haven where likeminded americans many of whom refer to themselves as preppers can live off the land be more selfsufficient and wait out the calamities to come the holy cause of liberty 
past the tactical gear and through a hallway at the back of redoubt surplus and tactical  youll find pastor warren campbells other venture the lordship church  
adorned in military garb and sporting an abe lincolnstyle beard campbell sets out folding metal chairs to get ready for his weekend service where about three dozen people usually come to hear him preach 
we love to preach on liberty the holy cause of liberty  george washington called liberty a sacred fire and our liberties are very very dear to us especially the liberties we have in jesus christ pastor warren campbell inside his makeshift church connected to his army surplus store in northern idaho erin collinscbc 
campbell says hes met dozens of people who have recently moved to the area mostly from california and colorado because theyre frustrated with what they feel is government overreach including rising taxes stiffer gun regulations and the affordable care act or obamacare 
he says hell likely vote for republican presidential candidate donald trump on nov  primarily because he believes a hillary clinton administration would erode religious freedoms and the right to bear arms 
and despite the polls campbell believes trump will win if he doesnt he expects the redoubt will get a lot more crowded 
i think we will see a great influx of people more than we are seeing right now multiplying by thousands coming here for safety and refuge 
with all the mudslinging and scandal that has defined this us presidential campaign perhaps it shouldnt be surprising theres talk of political migration 
once again this election cycle some democrats including several celebrities  have threatened to move to canada should their candidate lose 
folks in the redoubt suspect plenty of trump supporters will consider a move of their own if their candidate loses although not quite as far north people want to feel safe

santos says many of the people coming through his shop these days are new arrivals looking for a fresh start and a quieter more peaceful life 
many of the things that attracted my wife and i to this area are the same things that are attracting people today  people want to live in a place that feels like a community people want to feel safe when they go out at night 
santos a former army officer cop and minor pro hockey referee says the facility is signing up new members every day and many of them the vast majority of them in fact are from out of this area ed santos fires a pistol inside the gun range attached to his port falls idaho gun shop 
more than  kilometres east that search for safety and community drew chuck leveque and his wife to a wooded property in the isolated foothills of flathead county mont 
the former las vegas vice cop says his biggest worry is that terrorists could knock out americas electrical grid 
leveque opens the creaky doors of a large shipping container in his yard to show how hes prepared for the threat 
this is our fuel storage container and we have a tank with  gallons of diesel and a tank with  gallons of nonethanol regular gasoline 
the fuel will run leveques generator in the event of a prolonged power outage he says hes stored enough food and water for him and his wife to survive for up to four years 
but leveque believes he will also need to protect what hes stored from those who are less prepared so like many people here in the redoubt he has stockpiled weapons and ammunition too chuck leveque opens up the sea lift container that holds two tanks of fuel to run his generator in case the power grid goes down erin collinscbc 
the us and montana in particular is a gun culture and in the event of a large catastrophe we would need the guns to defend ourselves against people who would want to take our property and our preparedness stores 
in the meantime he worries the countrys political and economic power is waning saddled with too much debt and a political system that has ground to a halt 
its a problem he expects will get worse after the presidential campaign 
no matter which way the election turns out there is going to be a lot of angst by either side canning bullion and bullets

lebaron who is originally from southern alberta provides survival products and training including how to can everything from gold bullion to bullets 
you want to pack them tight so that they dont sound like bullets if somebody shakes it he said 
for lebaron life in the redoubt is about hoping for the best and preparing for the worst its a mantra he adopted while working with fema americas disaster management agency during the earthquake that rocked the san francisco bay area in  
when bad things happen people that you have called your friends for years are no longer your friends he said when people are cold tired and hungry they forget all about friendships 
his biggest worry is that a natural disaster like an earthquake or flood will disrupt normal life in america but he says the growing uncertainty about americas political and economic future is a close second 
he says trump presents conservatives in the redoubt with a difficult choice this election 
people if they are voting are going to be voting for trump but people dont want trump because nobody can control him and they are worried about what he will do so i guess i will call that a manmade disaster 
he expects the divisions this presidential campaign has reinforced across the country will remain long after the election and will feed some americans desire to retreat to the redoubt 
there is very much a division or a schism in the united states today where people are literally which side of the fence are you on",2016-10-28

ramallah occupied west bank  enas taha a resident of the palestinian village of kafr aldeek in the occupied west bank has become desperate 
since the water crisis started in june the municipality has been able to supply water for only one hour twice a week taha told al jazeera i am checking the weather forecast every day they announced rain three weeks ago but it has not come yet the only thing i can do is to pray to god 
many west bank communities are facing similar problems amid an acute water shortage that has lasted for months in the salfit jenin and hebron governorates some villages have gone as long as  days in a row without running water 
in midjuly residents in the bethlehem area staged a sitin for days to protest against the shortages sparking clashes between palestinian youths and israeli forces 
it is a very stressful situation i have to consider and prioritise every single drop of water i use taha said we have barely enough to drink cook shower and use the bathroom sometimes i dont do the laundry or clean the house for weeks it is hot and dusty this is exhausting enas taha shows her garden which has turned brown due to the severe water shortages since june eloise bollackal jazeera 
some palestinians have joked that the water bill collector comes to their homes more often than water as demand rises the cost of drinking water has skyrocketed with some families spending up to  percent of their meagre incomes to purchase it 
israel implements a policy of water cuts each summer but this year it reached an unprecedented peak in early june israeli water company mekorot informed the palestinian water authority pwa of summertime supply cuts totalling more than  percent  and the cuts while not as dramatic remain in effect today more than a month after the official end of summer 
we are in regular contact with mekorot to find a solution but they constantly give us different excuses such as the increase in demand rising temperature etc deeb abdelghafour the pwas director of the water resources department told al jazeera 
the notion that the region is suffering from water scarcity is a myth he added 
we have been facing shortages for decades and the reason is not natural but manmade  meaning the israeli occupation and israeli control over water resources in the palestinian territories 
israeli officials have stated that water resources are shared equally in israel and the occupied palestinian territories israels coordinator of government activities in the territories a unit in the israeli army noted that israel provides  million cubic metres of water to the palestinians annually even though it is only obliged to provide  million under the oslo accords 
however disparity is evident in the lush gardens parks and swimming pools in illegal israeli settlements the key difference is that palestinian villages in the west bank are not connected to the national water grid relying instead on local underground supplies 
palestinians living in remote areas have been hit the hardest by the ongoing water crisis as access roads are often poor and the additional costs of delivery result in higher prices 
we need special  trucks to drive on the unpaved roads and it can take up to two hours to reach the communities said hafez hureini a resident of attuwani village and leader of the south hebron hills popular committee taha shows her empty beehives last year we had bees so we could produce our own honey but all the bees died due to lack of water there are not enough flowers eloise bollackal jazeera 
over the summer israeli media reported that illegal jewish settlements in the west bank were also suffering from daily disruptions to water supplies prompting the israeli government to establish a new drilling site ariel  which would provide  cubic metres of water per hour 
abdelrahman tamimi director of the palestinian hydrology group for water and environmental resources development said that this was not where water was needed the most 
the wells should be drilled where there is important demand such as north and south of jenin south of hebron or northwest of the jordan valley why in ariel i wonder as a hydrologist there is already a well there they can simply improve its capacity  this measure was definitely not designed to supply palestinian communities tamimi told al jazeera 
in the meantime israel has accused palestinians of tapping into pipes with the israeli water authority asserting that  cubic metres of water is stolen every day by palestinians 
we are aware there is water theft  however we should ask ourselves why are the people stealing water simply because they are thirsty abdelghafour said 
at the same time increased water demands owing to growing israeli and palestinian populations is stretching the limits of existing water infrastructure most of the water network was installed in  when israel occupied the west bank today the diameters of the pipes are inadequate and the system is reaching the end of its life cycle 
even to upgrade infrastructure in area a and b is a headache abdelghafour said they israel impose long and complicated procedures in order to issue permits to import the smallest pieces or equipment 
data released by the israeli water authority shows that a large expansion in agriculture in the settlements has led to an estimated rise of  to  percent in water consumption this year 
the palestinian authority has no solution for the water crisis in my opinion israel has used this summer to put more pressure on us to purchase desalinated water so they can allocate groundwater for the settlements and their future expansion tamimi said 
since  five desalination plants have been built in israel now producing approximately  percent of the countrys water supply 
we dont want to substitute water from desalination plants for our historical rights to all shared water resources abdelghafour said once we have our basic rights based on equitable allocation of resources and international law then we can think of other development options such as desalination or treatment of waste water the original source of this article is al jazeera",2016-10-28

juror  vigorously defends the acrosstheboard acquittals of ammon bundy and his six codefendants calling the rulings a statement about the prosecutions failure to prove the fundamental elements of a conspiracy charge 
the fulltime marylhurst university business administration student was the juror who had sent a note to the judge on the fourth day of the initial jurys deliberations in the case questioning the impartiality of a fellow juror no  who the judge bounced from the jury a day later 
it should be known that all  jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove conspiracy in the count itself  and not any form of affirmation of the defenses various beliefs actions or aspirations juror  wrote friday in a lengthy email to the oregonianoregonlive 
he expressed relief that he can now speak out freely but he wasnt ready as of friday morning to drop his anonymity he said his studies have suffered since the trial started and hes not ready for the attention revealing his identity would bring but felt it was important to defend the verdict the judge withheld jurors names during the jury selection process and trial instead referring to each by number 
the jury closely followed us district judge anna j browns instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence and testimony heard during the fiveweek trial he said 
the jury returned unanimous verdicts of not guilty to conspiracy charges against all seven defendants each was accused of conspiring to prevent employees of the us fish and wildlife service and bureau of land management from carrying out their official work through intimidation threat or force during the day occupation 
juror  noted the panel couldnt simply rely on the defendantsdefining actions to convict 
all  agreed that impeding existed even if as an effect of the occupation he wrote 
but we were not asked to judge on bullets and hurt feelings rather to decide if any agreement was made with an illegal object in mind the marylhurst student wrote it seemed this basic high standard of proof was lost upon the prosecution throughout 
prosecutors had argued that the case at its core was about the illegal taking of anothers property the heavily armed guards that manned the front gate and watchtower during the day takeover in and of itself was intimidating and prevented officers from the us fish and wildlife service and us bureau of land management from carrying out their work they said 
they argued that the alleged conspiracy began nov  when ammon bundy and ally ryan payne met with harney county sheriff dave ward and promised there would be extreme civil unrest in the community if he didnt step in and block harney county ranchers dwight hammond jr and steven hammond the hammonds were slated to return to federal prison on jan  and serve out a mandatory minimum fiveyear sentence for arson on federal land 
defense lawyers urged jurors in closing arguments not to mixup the effect of the occupation  which undoubtedly kept federal employees from doing their jobs  from the intent of the occupiers 
five of the seven defendants including ammon bundy testified many said that they were there to protest in support of the hammonds and federal government overreach because they received absolutely no response from state or local government officials to their previous efforts to spur change 
the defense lawyers arguments coupled with the jury instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence resonated with jurors juror  noted 
inference while possibly compelling proved to be insulting or inadequate to  diversely situated people as a means to convict the juror wrote the air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us nor was it warranted given their burden of proof 
juror  plainly stated that fellow juror  during the initial round of deliberations had zero business being on this jury in the first place 
juror  had worked for the us bureau of land management as a ranch tech and firefighter more than  years ago he had said during jury selection asked by the judge during voir dire if that experience would impede his ability to be a fair and impartial judge of the facts he said not really 
juror  explained why he didnt alert the court immediately after he had heard juror  on day one of deliberations reportedly say i am very biased 
it wasnt until the fourth day into deliberations that juror  sent a note to the court asking if a juror who had worked previously for the federal land management agency and outright told the panel he was very biased could be an impartial judge the court flummoxed by the development a day later dismissed juror  for good cause after the prosecution and defense teams agreed to the dismissal at the time parties to the case werent sure which way juror s alleged bias fell 
juror  said he resisted the impulse to send the question sooner in an effort to give his fellow juror a chance to explain himself 
in his email to the oregonianoregonlive juror  for the first time also contended that juror  violated the judges explicit orders by hearkening to evidence that was never admitted in this case refused to consider the defendants state of mind and used imaginative theories to explain key actions 
juror  said though he wishes that he had sent the letter on day one since it would have alleviated much stress for all of us 
the maryville business student said he is baffled by what he described as observersflippant sentiments in the wake of the jurys acquittals 
dont they know that not guilty does not mean innocent he wrote it was not lost on us that our verdicts might inspire future actions that are regrettable but that sort of thinking was not permitted when considering the charges before us 
the jury he said met with judge brown after the verdicts were announced and after the us marshals physical confrontation and arrest of bundy lawyer marcus mumford 
he said many of the jurors questioned the judge about why the federal government chose the conspiracy charge he said he learned that a potential alternate charge such as criminal trespass wouldnt have brought as significant a penalty 
the charge of conspiring to impede federal employees from carrying out their official work through intimidation threat or force brings a maximum sentence of six years in prison 
we all queried about alternative charges that could stick and were amazed that this conspiracy charge seemed the best possible option juror  said

the fbi has reopened its investigation into hillary clintons use of a private server while secretary of state after discovering new emails in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election 
fbi director james comey wrote in a letter to top members of congress friday that the bureau has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation 
click here to read the letter 
comey did not detail those emails saying only that they surfaced in connection with an unrelated case 
he told lawmakers the investigative team briefed him on the information a day earlier and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation 
he said the fbi could not yet assess whether the new material is significant and he could not predict how long it will take to complete this additional work 
a senior law enforcement official separately told fox news the fbi decision is not linked to wikileaks messages or any hack and the newly discovered emails did not come from the clinton server  but from another device from another government official 
the move comes after comey and the justice department decided in july not to pursue charges over clintons email practices saying at the time that the investigation was finished 
comey has since come under criticism from donald trump lawmakers and others who claim the investigation downplayed the mishandling of classified information during clintons tenure 
trump speaking to cheering supporters friday afternoon in manchester nh praised the fbi for having the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made  saying he hopes that is corrected 
hillary clintons corruption is on a scale we have never seen before trump said we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the oval office 
in a nod to the significance of the fbis announcement trump quipped the rest of my speech is going to be so boring 
other gop lawmakers also weighed in urging the bureau to pursue a thorough new probe 
the fbis decision to reopen its investigation into secretary clinton reinforces what the house judiciary committee has been saying for months the more we learn about secretary clintons use of a private email server the clearer it becomes that she and her associates committed wrongdoing and jeopardized national security house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte rva said in a statement 
republican national committee chairman reince priebus said the discovery must be serious for the bureau to investigate this close to the election 
clinton did not respond to questions from reporters about the development as she landed in cedar rapids iowa and did not address the matter while speaking to supporters in the same city 
the development comes  days before the general election and is the latest shockwave to hit the race clinton had been gaining in the polls over trump in the wake of the release of footage showing trump talking about groping women and subsequent allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him 
however daily revelations from hacked clinton campaign emails obtained by wikileaks have become a headache for the democrats campaign the resumption of the fbi probe poses a potentially bigger problem 
ron hosko former assistant director of the fbi told fox news in a telephone interview that retired fbi officials were livid at comey over the fact that charges were not brought against clinton in round one of the investigation 
he lit her on fire and then walked away hosko said of comey holding a news conference laying out clintons mishandling of classified information but then not pressing criminal charges 
hosko said he still defends comey for not pressing charges because the fbi always has to make a decision based on what they have at the time hosko said he thinks agents were probing a separate matter and found emails that made them say oh my god look at what we have

the de blasio administration is trying to limit the number of food trucks in the city by claiming that each hotdog and kabob cart causes more pollution than a truck ride to los angeles 
deputy health commissioner corinne schiff made the claim at a city council hearing wednesday in an apparent effort to sink a bill that would nearly double the number of foodvendor permits in the city by  
meat grilling is a significant source of air pollution in the city schiff said one additional vendor grilling meat emits an amount of particle pollution in one day equivalent to what a diesel truck emits driving  miles 
the new bill would boost the number of permits to  by  and also create an enforcement team to sniff out violations 
since  the number of streetfood vending permits has remained steady at  but there are likely more carts than that on the streets as some vendors simply open shop without a license and work until they are caught 
schiff argued any increase in the number of food carts needs to come with regulations stipulating that the carts operate in a more environmentally friendly manner 
city councilman mark levine dmanhattan who is sponsoring the bill to increase the permits wondered if this was already the case we have laws in the city about air quality that currently stipulate that any food establishment has got to have a hood over a grill levine said is that not currently the law 
schiff however said there are no such laws regulating the carts as she suggested the proposals be delayed to ensure better pollution safeguards 
we really see this as an opportunity to work with the council to think through how we might use this modernization act to improve air quality she said the current laws dont actually control the emissions that were concerned about 
businessimprovement districts and residents throughout the city also pushed for delays on increasing vendor permits saying there are too many already in some neighborhoods but welcomed increased enforcement 
the enforcement idea is a great idea said ellen baer cochair of the nyc bid association lets see if this works lets see how it works lets see if its sufficiently funded lets see how many resources they need  before we start adding to the chaos 
but street vendors argued theyve waited too long for reforms that would allow them to transition from operating illegally to legally 
sean basinski director of the street vendor project described the bills as far from our dream but said he supports most of what they call for 
it is a reasonable compromise he said vendors have been waiting  years for this change    we certainly welcome a study being done but we dont think that should delay the progress that needs to be made the time for reform is now 
before the hearing some vendors rallied outside demanding that city officials and police stop harassing them and treating them like criminals 
the bill will remain before the committee while members discuss possible changes",2016-10-28

despite the fact that dnc operatives have been exposed as the ones inciting violence at rallies  robert creamer and scott foval for example  and working overtime to bus in illegal voters and rig the vote  the media is going out of its way to paint trump supporters and grassroots americans as the ones plotting violence

his heated rhetoric is a response to the endless episodes of fraud dirty trick and foul play by the hillary campaign as it seems that she will stop at nothing to become the first female potus  just the sort of abuse of power that the founders warned about 
 erupted in response to a long train of abuses  acts of oppression and hostility listed in the declaration of independence that is being largely repeated in modern day america 
could hillarys reported election victory  or donald trumps defeat  signal civil unrest and a new wave of resistance particularly if the results are widely viewed as fraudulent or rigged trump for one has certainly been talking up the possibility of a stolen election 
the scenario is plausible enough that the pentagon and homeland security have been carrying out secret drills in the lead up to the election to prepare for the possibility of a martial law response to violence or civil unrest 
as shtf detailed in an exclusive report a whistleblower has come forward on the ominous contingency plan to keep andor restore order if the populace revolt against the establishments selection for president 
if there is any truth to it the  election could be a kickoff for total tyranny 
according to an unnamed source  who has provided accurate intel in the past  an unannounced military drill is scheduled to take place during a period leading up to the election and throughout the month after 
date october th   days after the election suspected region northeast specifically new york 
st phase nrol no rule of law  drill involving combat arms in metro areas active and reserve source says active duty and reserve service members are being vaccinated as if they are being deployed in theatre 
nd phase lrol limited rule of law  militaryfema consolidating resources controlling water supply handing out to public as needed 
rd phase arol authoritarian rule of law  possible new acronym or term for martial law curfew restricted movements basically martial law scenario 
source said exercise involves femadhsmilitary 
at this point no one can say for certain what will happen in the aftermath of november  but it is clear that millions and millions of americans are dissatisfied with the status quo troubled about the economic realities perpetuated by the fed and angry that hillary may be put in the oval office rather than a jail cell despite a trail of corruption with virtually no end

849,de blasio administration finds a way to ruin food trucks,"off the grid news  by daniel jennings 
a public school official in florida has urged citizens to fight truancy by reporting any children they suspect might not be in school or being educated  including homeschool families 
it is all part of an antitruancy initiative called operation round up in which residents of jackson county florida are urged to be on the lookout for children not in school and to report them to school officials or to police 
a truancy report can lead to a home check by sheriffs deputies or police and possibly the arrest of the parents tv station wjhg reported 
the policy of the jackson county school district is to send law enforcement to the homes of suspected truants 
sometimes if these citizens dont call me i have no way of knowing shirl williams director of student services for the school system told the tv station so if its a nosy neighbor be a nosy neighbor just call me and let me check out the situation 
williams acknowledged that homeschool children can be mistaken for truants but urged citizens to report them so school authorities can investigate 
sometimes the community will see them around town and they think hey theyre not being educated sometimes the community is right williams said 
home school legal defense association attorney tj schmidt wrote williams and the jackson county superintendent saying that while truancy is a problem homeschoolers should not be targeted 
your statements suggest that everyone should report children they think arent being educated the letter read in our opinion this is a threatening practice and will instill a spirit of suspicion and hostility against homeschoolers in the community 
schmidt wrote to williams after a parent saw her on tv and complained to hsdla

850,if trump loses im grabbing my musket former congressman ready to go full revolution,"portland ore koin  the last person to surrender in the malheur national wildlife refuge takeover was released from prison hours after being acquitted on federal conspiracy charges thursday afternoon  
david fry was found not guilty of conspiring to impede workers from doing their jobs at the refuge through threats intimidation or force he was also acquitted of a firearms charge 
the ohio resident spoke to koin  news before stepping onto the streets of downtown portland for the first time in  months 
fry said he was excited to reunite with family and friends to celebrate the victory adding that his plight to end corruption is far from overits a wonderful feeling to be acquitted by the highest authority in this country fry said i definitely feel this was divine intervention playing in this 
weve all got to work together and start making some changes because our governments worldwide arent for the people he said theyve become the opposite 
he said guards at multnomah county jail treated him as if he were guilty and that inmates are not often dealt with fairly or under the presumption of innocence 
i guess this is the greatest example of why you dont treat people as guilty because they can be acquitted fry said 
fry was one of the last  holdouts at the refuge and helped broadcast the final days of the standoff through youtube livestreams he allegedly threatened to commit suicide while on the phone with fbi crisis negotiators before he surrendered 
defense attorneys called his father william fry to the witness stand to discuss his motives for joining the occupation william said his son was frustrated with corruption and wanted to support dwight and steve hammond who he believed were falsely characterized as terrorists

851,david fry released from jail,"oregon live  by maxine bernstein 
a federal jury on thursday found ammon bundy his brother ryan bundy and five codefendants not guilty of conspiring to prevent federal employees from doing their jobs through intimidation threat or force during the day occupation of the malheur national wildlife refuge 
the bundy brothers and occupiers jeff banta and david fry also were found not guilty of having guns in a federal facility kenneth medenbach was found not guilty of stealing government property and a hung jury was declared on ryan bundys charge of theft of fbi surveillance cameras 
more than we could have hoped for said one of ammon bundys lawyers j morgan philpot 
stunning said defense lawyer lisa ludwig who was standby counsel for ryan bundy 
im just thrilled said neil wamplers attorney lisa maxfield 
the jury of nine women and three men returned the verdicts after five hours of deliberations on thursday in the highprofile case that riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the federal bird sanctuary in rural eastern oregon 
each defendant stood separately facing the jury as the judge read the verdicts ammon bundy his hands clasped behind his back nodded as the not guilty verdicts were read for him first as he sat he smiled and rubbed the shoulder of his lawyer marcus mumford 
his older brother ryan bundy stood as his not guilty verdicts were read he nodded and mouthed to the jury thank you defendant neil wampler hugged and kissed his defense lawyer maxfield 
the coda to the stunning verdict undoubtedly a significant blow to federal prosecutors was when ammon bundys lawyer marcus mumford argued that his client dressed in a gray suit and white dress shirt should be allowed to walk out of the court a free man 
us district judge anna j brown told him that there was a us marshals hold on him from a pending federal indictment in nevada 
oregon standoff defendant jeff banta is relieved by acquittals 
if theres a detainer show me mumford stood arguing before the judge 
suddenly a group of about six us marshals surrounded mumford at his defense table the judge directed them to move back but moments later the marshals grabbed on to him 
what are you doing mumford yelled as he struggled and was taken down to the floor 
as deputy marshals yelled stop resisting the judge demanded everybody out of the courtroom now 
mumford was taken into custody a member of his legal team confirmed 
ammon bundys lawyer j morgan philpot said afterwards on the courthouse steps that mumford had been arrested and marshals had used a stun gun or taser on his back another member of ammon bundys legal team rick koerber echoed philpot saying he heard mumford questioning in court why they were using a taser against him 
philpot decried the marshals treatment of mumford in the courtroom what happened at the end is symbolic of the improper use of force by the federal government he said 
by  pm mumford was released from custody he confirmed that he was struck with a stun gun once while he was on the floor of the courtroom 
i grew up on a dairy farm so am i used to some rough treatment sure he said but he said the actions of the us marshals were uncalled for 
all i was asking for was papers just show me you have the authority to take mr bundy into custody 
as to the verdict very pleased very gratified this jury was dedicated they listened to our case 
just after the verdicts were announced people emerged onto the front steps of the courthouse to tell a crowd of media and onlookers 
supporters of the defendants gathered in a joyous hug one of them brand thornton of las vegas one of the original occupiers who accompanied ryan bundy and others onto the refuge on jan  and was called as witness by the defense said that he has been at the trial since oct  
the verdict means everything thornton said its huge for ranchers and land rights within harney county and across the west he said 
we did something peaceful and wanted to stay peaceful said thornton who has kept vigil outside the courthouse blowing a shofar 
this is for the people of oregon thornton said this was never for us 
wampler appeared on the courthouse steps and described the verdict as a stunning victory for rural america 
david frys lawyer per c olson said it was the right result 
i think the jury saw through this that they were wellmeaning wellintentioned individuals olson said the jury saw that the defendants cared about the hammonds and didnt like how the federal government was treating them 
maxfield who represented wampler came out of the courthouse holding up her fists she said she has never seen anything like this happen where multiple defendants in a federal court trial were all acquitted and called it one of the most significant cases in her career 
defendant shawna cox said she had a peaceful feeling as she waited for the verdicts but i didnt expect wed all be found not guilty 
i wept cox said it brings me to tears im so grateful to the jury 
defense lawyer matthew schindler standby counsel to defendant kenneth medenbach who was excused from court because of medical ailments said he called his client right away 
hes been fighting for more than  years to be in a situation where a jury acquitted him schindler said its vindication 
schindler said he believes the jurys verdicts resulted from the difficulty the government had in proving that the intent of the defendants was to conspire against the us fish and wildlife service and us bureau of land management 
the judge gave us broad ability to bring in a defendants state of mind and what you saw was a number of defendants who each had their own motivations schindler said 
when prosecuting a drug conspiracy its easy to point to what the defendants underlying objective is but in this case schindler said there was no obvious underlying self interest he said the defense also was bolstered because the jurors came from different regions from the state and not just from portland 
oregon us attorney billy williams sat in the back of the courtroom with oregons fbi special agent in charge gregg bretzing as the verdicts were read williams left the courtroom early before the scrum with mumford to attend a gathering of the league of minority voters in salem thursday night 
harney county sheriff dave ward who was the face of law enforcement during the day refuge takeover said in a statement while i am disappointed in the outcome i believe our form of government and justice system to be the best in the world these folks were tried in a court of law and found not guilty by a jury of their peers this is our system and i stand by it 
the fiveweek trial offered a rare display three of the seven defendants chose to represent themselves five of them were among the more than  people who took the witness stand to testify 
and one of the original  jurors was dismissed after a fellow juror raised concerns about his impartiality four days into an initial round of deliberations  what the judge called an extraordinary circumstance an alternate juror was summoned to begin a new round of deliberations with the remaining  jurors thursday morning 
there was heightened security in and around the courthouse throughout the trial with security officers ordered to wear bulletproof vests and metal detectors set up outside the main trial courtroom and an overflow room with a live video feed of the proceedings 
often supporters knelt in prayer in the courthouse corridor before the trial began in the mornings and some kept vigil across the street with one fellow occupier blowing a rams horn or shofar as the jury deliberated 
pending prosecutions 
the seven on trial were among  people indicted on the conspiracy charge 
eleven of them pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge 
seven others are set for trial on feb  but their cases may be affected by the verdicts if convictions are handed down in this case then defendants scheduled for trial in february might consider potential pleas if there are acquittals prosecutors may rethink going to trial on same charges against codefendants next year 
on the eve of jury selection in this case prosecutors agreed to dismiss the conspiracy charge against pete santilli an independent broadcaster and selfdescribed shock jock who provided live stream footage of the occupation 
nevada case 
ammon bundy and ryan bundy also face prosecution in nevada in the  standoff with federal agents over the impounding of their fathers cattle near bunkerville nevada 
the trial there is set to start feb  the two brothers and father cliven bundy are among  indicted in nevada others from the oregon refuge occupation also indicted on federal charges in nevada are pete santilli ryan payne brian cavalier blaine cooper and joseph oshaughnessy 
payne pleaded guilty to the federal conspiracy charge in oregon under a potential global agreement that was in the works with nevada prosecutors but he recently asked to withdraw the oregon plea because no deal was reached in nevada prosecutors in portland have until oct  to respond 
cooper entered guilty pleas in both cases oshaughnessy pleaded guilty in the oregon case with a deal pending in nevada cavalier pleaded guilty in the oregon case

853,occupier david fry released from jail im really free,"one twitter user once asked me is it too much to hope that one of our parties would pick someone with no links to a pedophile sexslave island 
apparently it is too much to ask for 
both presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump and former president bill clinton have ties to convicted pedophile and democratic donor billionaire jeffery epstein and sex slave island 
note president bill clinton is not merely the husband of democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton either bill is currently campaigning for his wife plus hillary recently unveiled that bill with be in charge of  revitalizing the economy  if she were to take office 
it has been uncovered that clinton known for his troublemaking libido has even stronger ties to epstein than previously reported as noted by the free beacon  clinton was aboard the infamous lolita express owned by a billionaire pedophile at least  times not the initially reported  times 
fox news reports  
clintons presence aboard jeffrey epsteins boeing  on  occasions has been reported but flight logs show the number is more than double that and trips between  and  included extended junkets around the world with epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names including tatiana the trickedout jet earned its nabakovinspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girlsofficial flight logs filed with the federal aviation administration show clinton traveled on some of the trips with as many as  us secret service agents however on a fiveleg asia trip between may  and may   not a single secret service agent is listed 
the republican presumptive nominee apparently got in on the action too trumps ties to epstein  a man trump once called a terrific guy  and sex slave island have been chronicled by the daily wire here  
per the political insider trump is accused of threatening and raping a yearold girl on the private island  epstein is also named in the suit for sexual misconduct the lawsuit accusations have been vehemently denied by the trump camp alleging that the filing is a hoax and that there is no evidence that the plaintiff in question actually exists 
sex slave island sometimes referred to as orgy island both lovely names is one deranged place allegedly rife with solicited sex often from minors  groomed  by epstein

854,jury finds all oregon standoff defendants not guilty of federal conspiracy gun charges,"indian country  by theresa braine 
more details are emerging about yesterdays police action on highway  about three miles from the cannonball river commencing shortly before noon a large contingent of heavily armed officers worked to clear a route for dakota access oil pipeline dapl trenches in a relentless push that resulted in numerous instances of violent confrontations culminating in the seizure of the newly established treaty camp and removal of a number of tents tipis and sweat lodges 
the morton county sheriffs department said that  people had been arrested and that at least one bullet had been fired from the frontlines 
officers met violence and resistance including a protester who fired a gun at officers in the police line protesters who threw molotov cocktails at them and set vehicles and debris on fire the sheriffs office said in a post on facebook  
an ap news story cites state spokesperson cecily wong describing a woman who drew a  caliber pistol and firing three times at officers an account disputed by activists and not recorded on any of the onthescene video or live feeds currently circulating 
however tribal law enforcement apprehended a heavilyarmed man crouched in a creek with apparent connections to a private security firm hired by dapls builders the standing rock sioux tribe posted a description of the incident on its facebook page  a man was apprehended carrying an assault rifle with papers indicating he was employed by a private security firm according to the standing rock sioux tribe 
as reported via video evidence from the front lines on  a man bearing an assault rifle broke thru a barricade and was speeding toward the oceti sakowin camp he was run off the road  mile north from the camp the man exited the vehicle where he appeared to be disguised as a water protector he than fired several shots from his assault rifle tribal law enforcement responded the man was then apprehended insurance documents from the vehicle reveal that it is owned by dakota access pipeline we commend the bia law enforcement to their commitment of public safety and for their quick response and apprehension of the suspect who was clearly meaning to do harm 
a statement by the camp of the sacred stones one of three prayer camps set up near the standing rock sioux reservation catalogued exactly how the unarmed protectors were met by lots of firepower over  police officers in riot gear  atvs  armored vehicles  helicopters and numerous militarygrade humvees showed up north of the newly formed frontline camp just east of highway  the  treaty camp was set up this past sunday directly in the path of the pipeline on land recently purchased by dapl today this camp a reclamation of unceded lakota territory affirmed as part of the standing rock reservation in the ft laramie treaty of  was violently cleared both blockades established this past weekend to enable that occupation were also cleared 
at least one sniper atop a humvee scanned the crowd of protectors people and horses were shot at with beanbag guns noise concussion devices were used and fireextinguishersized canisters of tear gas and mace were deployed police used pepper spray and mace liberally photo savannah joefacebook 
standing rock sioux chairman david archambault ii blasted the use of force the continued construction and the numerous violations of civil and human rights 
we have repeatedly seen a disproportionate response from law enforcement to water protectors nonviolent exercise of their constitutional rights he said in a statement today we have witnessed people praying in peace yet attacked with pepper spray rubber bullets sound and concussion cannons we urge state and federal government agencies to give this tense situation their immediate and close attention 
he noted that dapl parent company energy transfer partners had completely ignored the request by the administration of president barack obama to voluntarily halt construction while the legal issues raised by the tribe were resolved 
by deploying law enforcement to support dapl construction the state of north dakota is collaborating with energy transfer partners and escalating tensions archambault said we need our state and federal governments to bring justice and peace to our lands not the force of armored vehicles 
archambault urged everyone who supports standing rocks efforts to divert or halt the pipeline to remain peaceful and prayerful and not resort to violence or lash out in anger 
any act of violence hurts our cause and is not welcome here he said we invite all supporters to join us in prayer that ultimately the right decisionthe moral decisionis made to protect our people our sacred places our land and our resources we wont step down from this fight as peoples of this earth we all need water this is about our water our rights and our dignity as human beings 
firsthand accounts bore stark witness to the events as they happened via facebook live feeds social media posts and other dispatches from the front lines 
dallas goldtooth organizer of the keep it in the ground movement with the indigenous environmental network posted updates throughout the day 
president obama had asked that work stop within  miles of river yet national guard were used to clear the way for yesterdays police sweep  dapl construction he wrote dapl security forces were part of the invasion they had armed men with ar and had malicious intent to sneak into the camp 
he said that men and women had been pulled out of a sweat lodge ceremony at gunpoint 
the similarities to wounded knee cannot be ignored there was potential last night to turn a peaceful protest into a major tragedy he wrote 
goldtooth also contrasted such treatment of unarmed water protectors with the acquittal on the same day of the armed militia who took over malheur wildlife refuge 
the racial undertones of yesterdays actions cannot be ignored goldtooth wrote armed white men stand off against police in oregon acquitted unarmed water protectors in north dakota concussion grenades rubber bullets and batons 
he said that north dakota polices characterization of them as armed vigilantes was patently false jesus wagner was shot in the face with a rubber bullet photo facebook 
the only weapons on site yesterday were in the hands of militarized police he wrote assault rifles snipers concussion grenades batons etc 
the harm was not limited to humans riders on horseback were also assaulted and one horse was killed 
horseback riders were attacked by police on atvs resulting in one horse being hurt so severely that it had to be put down goldtooth said there were national guard humvees on site with snipers stationed on top 
not even medical personnel were immune 
they sprayed me with my hands up and my back to them with all my medic markings clearly showing they sprayed me head to toe said one man in a facebook post by the standing rock medic  healer council they pointed shotguns at me they pointed shotguns at my back while i was treating patients 
jon eagle sr tribal historic preservation officer of the standing rock sioux tribe spoke of the heartbreak 
my heart hurts he said on facebook because of the actions of a few many people were hurt today people were shot with rubber bullets and beanbags they used pepper spray percussion grenades and sound cannons numerous arrests i cant believe what i witnessed today and its still going on prayers for the protectors tonight 
there were uplifting moments as well as the conflict escalated a woman yelled at everyone to look at the buffalo 
we all turned to the east to see a herd of buffalo come charging eagle said behind them were young warriors on horse back police in atvs charged after them there were shots fired the young men rode through the line of atvs and made their get away a war cry went up from the crowd im proud to say we are still the greatest light cavalry in the world

brooding and bearded face shadowed by an odd hat cutlass scars on his arms and a dark patch where his eye ought to be the pirate is a familiar stereotype countless movies have worn him down to a smooth and unremarkable cliche 
but what if that cliche has depths that have yet to be mined by the movie industry 
that is the question that israeliamerican director arnon z shorr blood and stone a legend of the golem a modest suggestion glimpse has chosen to tap into with the pirate captain toledano  beneath the pirates hat hides another sort of hat a jewish one for the pirate captain toledano is a jewish pirate what sort of jew becomes a pirate and why 
touching on true history that is one of the questions that shorrs film proposes to answer 
recent years have seen growing interest in the history of jewish pirates and what initially seems absurd quickly becomes a fascinating exploration of how much of history is lost when legend becomes cliche as a pioneering filmmaker arnon z shorr has chosen to tackle this ambitious project with the aid of two vessels at the ocean institute a dedicated cast and support from the public 
though the process of bringing the pirate captain toledano from vision to reality has only begun the journey has already been marked by fortuitous coincidences including the discovery that cast member stephen decordova captain toledano hailed from ancestors who were jewish pirates and a treasured kiddush cup in his possession which likely dates back from those days will play a key role in the story

858,obama should just pardon hillary for every conceivable crime,"posted by madeline  oct      daily blog    thanks heru by lisa brown  i find it interesting to experienceobserve i can see their desire to exposehonor their hearts yet their confusion at losing their masculine persona if they do i can see their beauty magnificence and purity of their soul and their not knowing how to be a man and feel all this stuff emerging within them i can also see them put stronger walls up trying their best to hold on to old realities not true anymore fear of feeling hurt failure and losing control letting anyone in being let down abandoned judged which do not occur on new earth 
it is no different than when we woke up women and feminine energy men yet it is for theyve lived this life of strength of being powerful of being strong and surviving everything for the really really masculine energy man or women but we are talking about men right now their softness brings forth fear of vulnerability which is so totally the opposite for we must allow ourselves that rawnessthat vulnerability in order to truly feel again to bring the walls of protection down to not live in the fear of being alone 
when our soul awakens we desire connection deeply yet we seek it in others first experience after experience activates our unworthiness feeling of notgoodenough lack of intimate lasting connection rejected for not being enough in others minds where they are not intune with their own sacred soul 
we are in the vibrations of the very masculine man awakening now more and more its important to support them show them that they can be masculine and honor their soul at the same time its important to open up and share to show them its safe to be seen its important to not impose not pressure not push just hold the space for them to open up on their own and not feel threatened as they do its important for the women to support the men now yet in very different ways than before 
those who have opened their hearts know that our relationships are very different here we do not hold attachments cords expectations or needs anymore all new earth relationships are powerful beautiful freeing supportive empowering inspiring and a cocreative experience of inservice to ourselves each other and all on earth they are to usher in the new era this one now through unity peace respect support contribution and divine love 
many men have been trying to wake up going through their distortions shedding old human needs and exchanging them for new desires to take their place in this new world now the more human masculine energy the more safety protection and survival mechanisms there were judgment is huge and its scary when your whole world starts to change for you and you dont have a choice anymore 
women its your time to stepup to be the one that already understands to be the one who holds that space and the stability in place when the old starts to collapse crumble dissolve when emotions start to surface that you didnt know were there when nothing makes sense and you dont understand why you cant keep it together anymore and be the one that everyone could depend on physically we all know what this is like weve been there 
weve been through the collapse to move into creation of the new to rebirth ourselves our own realities and now the men do this too there are many who were not ready before yet those times vibrations are gone you will start to see more men awaken especially the strong ones and the fear of how to deal with this part of your job as an ascended being as a master being as a light tower and a keeper of new earth is to not just hold the space but show them how its all not only going to be okay its going to be awesome 
it doesnt matter what body we are in female or male men now identify with their masculine bodies as an expectation that they are supposed to be the strong one the providers the ones that dont break when we know better 
when the soul awakens the human aspect does breakdissolve and it doesnt matter what bodies we are in this process is genderless we all have human masculine human feminine and we have divine masculine and divine feminine too 
relationships built or formed out of unconsciousness collapse end reshape or transform often all of these some go their separate ways while each evolves awakens diesrebirthsgrows up as spiritsoul in physical body form 
many womenspartnersfriends roles will be to support others and super masculine man now ready to open up just because they struggled before resisted before doesnt mean they still arewill when you show them wayshower that you can handle it you can be the support you can even be the provider if need be then they can honor themselves without the weight of everyone depending on them to do it all by themselves anymore 
as masculinefeminine are redefined according to energy and that each can fill all of these roles themselves then the balance can shift easily and each as they honor themselves and step up into their own roles can support others ready to do this too

861,as the super masculine guysmen wakeup your roles change  lisa transcendence brown,"south africa 
issues surrounding a minimum wage bill education and services are being utilized in attempts to overthrow the african national congress 
south african president jacob zuma has come out publically to state that there are efforts underway by the west to undermine the african national congress anc government which has held power for over  years 
a myriad of challenges are facing the south african ruling party including an economic recession the bringing of several allegations about corruption within the office of the presidency a declining stock market and national currency along with increasingly worsening relations with the united states 
in africa there are numerous examples from the postcolonial period of the last five decades where the intelligence and military apparatuses of the imperialist states have sought to reverse the forward progress of the masses of workers farmers youth and their leadership in the recent period in the south american state of brazil the first woman president dilma rousseff of the workers party was forcefully removed from office in a political coup 
in addition to the decline in the south african economy largely due to the overall world crisis which has driven down commodity prices and systematically disinvested from the emerging states there has been a fracturing of the national democratic movement and the workers organizations over contentious debates surrounding a way forward in an october report delivered at the world federation of trade unions wftu  th congress in durban south africa dr blade nzimande the secretary general of the south african communist party sacp placed these contradictions inside the national democratic revolution and the largest trade union federation the congress of south african trade unions cosatu within a broader context of the desire by the imperialist states to reverse the advances of the liberation struggles 
in a recent article published by the agence france press afp president zuma emphasized that western powers want to remove the anc because they do not want the anc to develop relations with those countries which helped the party in the antiapartheid struggle this statement was made by president zuma on nov  laid the blame directly on certain western countries which do not wish the ruling african national congress success 
zuma spoke to anc supporters at a rally in bushbuckridge mpumalanga province that the imperialist states were utilizing some anc members to further their agenda adding that some party members had been won over to the views of western countries the president said that those anc members calling for his resignation were in fact serving the interests of the western states 
the political economy of destabilization 
since  there have been substantial reforms initiated under the anc government there has been the construction of housing for the poor and working class the expansion of healthcare the breaking down of racial barriers in public facilities along with access to household utilities and clean drinking water 
however the fundamental relations and ownership of production remains under the control of the capitalist class as a manifestation of modernday capitalism high unemployment rising costs of living including education fees as well as problems associated with service delivery have continued 
in all other countries the majority controls everything from politics economy and defense    its only in this country south africa where we dont have economic freedom its controlled by the minority and those who oppressed us zuma stressed afp nov  
the president went on to say that is why they are scared that we will take away this economy they want to take away the strength of the anc because they know the anc is the only organization trying to balance the scales 
zuma said that his government would not break ties with longtime friends internationally in order to win the approval of the imperialist governments the president had also spoke at the wftu  th congress noting that the capitalist system would not relinquish concessions to the working class without demands based upon mass struggle 
recounting the history of the national liberation movement in south africa zuma said socialist countries like russia and china helped the anc giving it military training and aid during the antiapartheid struggle the socialist countries came to our aid it was russia who trained us and helped us with the tools to fight china and other socialist countries helped us 
in addition zuma said the western states are retaliating against the anc government due its affiliation with the brazil russia india china and south africa brics summit the advent of such blocs among the emerging states was a threat to western hegemony of the world economy 
they are fighting us because we joined brics some are in anc gear but are in the company of the west we are at war we are going to protect the anc zuma emphasized 
in an article published by the south african mail  guardian in reference to the stock values of holdings traded on the local market it noted should south africa avoid having its credit rating cut to junk in the next two weeks it could just be staving off the inevitable more than half of  economists surveyed by bloomberg said sp global ratings will strip the nation of its investmentlevel rating the median probability of south africa retaining its current assessment in december is  falling to only  in  the survey shows the economy faces a cut to junk on its foreigncurrency credit rating as output is forecast to expand at the slowest pace this year since a  recession delaying the governments plans to narrow the shortfall on the budget and rein in debt nov  
debate surrounds a national minimum wage amid allegation of regime change agenda 
the anc government has proposed the adoption of a national monthly minimum wage of  rand which is approximately  us dollars  percent of the working population earns less than this proposed amount bbc nov  
despite the possible introduction of such legislation it falls far short of what is actually needed to maintain a basic household prof chris malikane of the university of witwatersrand in johannesburg suggested that  rand per month was essential in maintaining a decent home bbc nov  
this issue is controversial among the business interests which claim that any significant governmentmandated increase in the minimum wage would create further unemployment which stands officially at around  percent over the last few years there have been largescale job losses in the mining sector which is impacting economic recovery 
two years ago cosatu proposed a minimum wage of  rand per month with inflation since  the amount would be at least  today 
deputy president cyril ramaphosa said the  rand per month figure was decided by a panel of experts ramaphosa said we are now a step closer to finalizing discussions on the national minimum wage all social partners will now decide what their take is bbc nov  
the anc must address the issues of joblessness poverty and service delivery in order to win back its twothirds majority electoral base inside the country local governmental elections which were held in august saw a decline in support for the ruling party by approximately ten points although it remains by far the most popular party in south africa winning  percent of the votes in the august poll 
a commission report issued several weeks ago alleged that the government of president zuma has been involved in corruption zuma has denied the charges and attempts to pass motions of noconfidence in parliament failed on numerous occasions the current anc leadership seems solidly committed to keeping zuma in office until his term expires in  
the party maintains that washington through its embassy in pretoria is pursuing a regimechange agenda party spokesperson zize kodwa stated in march they have taken about  young people to america to train them as part of their leadership program what we got from those young people is not what they expected they were trained on how to destabilize the country and regime change xinhua news agency march ",2016-10-26

866,austrian schools evacuated over radioactive rock,"the war against payday lending apple uses similar tactics with iphone jonathan lee  misesorg  october   comments image credits flickr khrawlings  
in june of  the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb put forward a proposal to regulate the shortterm loan industry 
the small dollar lending rule seeks to alleviate and solve for the apparent weaknesses of the current rates and shortterm lenders by requiring lenders to assess and verify a borrowers income housing costs and credit and legal obligations 
the intention of the proposal is to protect lowincome families from being caught in an endless cycle where many are forced to take out another loan to make ends meet at first glance it seems that the rule would solve problems in an industry known for its dirtiness except policymakers are thinking with their hearts while sitting in their airconditioned offices away from the facts and any form of interaction with the real world of shortterm loans just the fact that they see the shortterm loan industry as dirty supplies sufficient reason to believe that either these policymakers are ignorantly prejudiced or plainly manipulative 
instead of pointing fingers and name calling at the shortterm lending industry they should be applying simple economics to their proposals to see if they hold water 
in understanding the cfpb proposal for payday and other small loans a paper released by the cfpb and pew charitable trusts the bureau aimed to make several arguments in favor of new legislation 
the first of its arguments is that with payday and vehicle title loan markets lenders and borrowers interests are not aligned because profitability for lenders depends on loans being unaffordable for customers but doesnt this argument stand for any industry that sells a product 
for example are the interests of iphone sellers and buyers aligned in the manner acceptable to the cfpb each additional iphone  is said to cost  to produce and is sold for  dollars that is  times its cost to make to borrow a phrase from the left thats pricegouging to the tune of  percent yet there is no noise from policymakers claiming to call apple a company that cheats its customers 
so why should shortterm lenders be held accountable in any way that is different than apple shouldnt shortterm lenders be able to charge interest rates that makeup for the huge risk they incur in lending money out to lowincome borrowers 
studies show these lenders charge on average  percent or  for every  loaned  a profit margin that is significantly less than the price percentage difference of products in other markets 
the second of the cfpbs arguments is that to solve for balloon payments or the cycle of continued borrowing to pay off loans the cfpb would require that most products become installment loans with smaller manageable payments 
the problem with this statement is that the bureau completely ignores the reason why shortterm loans are so available to borrowers  its because shortterm loan companies can offset risk by requiring borrowers to weigh their own risk against their need to borrow 
simply put the short payment periods are put in place to deter those who definitely should not borrow additionally making the periods longer and the payments smaller defeats the business model making shortterm lenders irrelevant because their models are defined by their expediency 
the third of the cfpbs arguments is that their proposal would solve the problems related to price gouge lending by requiring lenders to evaluate borrowers financial condition by forcing borrowers to submit written statements on income housing expenses all outstanding debt and child support meanwhile the lender is required to obtain a national credit report and then deliver that data to all proposed credit tracking agencies 
remember all of these governmentimposed requirements cost the shortterm lenders money the cost of finding out this data would eliminate any ability that firms have to loan small amounts of cash at current interest rates the result would either lead shortterm loan companies to shut down or further hurt borrowers by requiring that they borrow larger sums of money to qualify for loans 
lastly the cfpb heralds that their redesign is prompted by a study by the pew charitable trusts survey research that the vast majority of borrowers want  most products to become installment loans with smaller manageable payments 
at first glance it seems that borrowers in need are hurting and want to find a way out of a difficult situation although there are those who are caught in the inability to pay back loans because they got caught in bad finance due to the risk of shortterm loans many of those surveyed actually sent in raving reviews in support of shortterm loans 
in fact more than  percent of the  submissions to the bureaus  tell your story  program  where people sent in their experiences regarding shortterm loans  were positive and excessively thankful for these loans 
these responses ranged from there are no other avenues out there that can lend money like this to a simple thank you this study was personally conducted by the cfpb unsatisfied with the results they hid it from the publics view until a freedom of information act request forced them to release it 
this holding back of information demonstrates that the bureau is not truly searching to help the people it says it wants to help rather they have a keen eye for policy symbolism and the flash of fighting for the underdog when in fact they are irreversibly harming them while sticking a knife in their back 
policymakers continue the belief that shortterm loans are as bad as they seem comes either because they did not attend their economics classes in college or they simply want to be perceived as someone who cares but we cannot let policymakers make decisions because their hearts lead them to make uneducated proposals we cannot let legislators sway our hearts because we hear about the extreme situations where people are hurt instead we need to look at the coldhard facts the numbers that the cfpb uses to defend their arguments are manipulative and outright false 
the small dollar lending rule must not be allowed to pass and the proposal must be removed and taken back  it will only hurt the people it claims it will help let americans make decisions for themselves  theyre smarter and more riskaverse than washington insiders give them credit for

867,there may be another planet in our solar system,"levers of power flushing the vote down the memory hole electronic election fraud exposed david knight  infowarscom  october   comments 
establishment politicians and press are outraged that trump would question the integrity of their system 
they say it undermines public trust in political institutions 
yet to see who is truly undermining public trust we need look no further than the people running the elections who are shutting down election audit procedures who stonewall and eject certified election monitors and who make any recording of malfunctioning voting machines a felony 
one such person is texas director of elections keith ingram 
this story is specific to texas but the same tactics are used nationwide by both parties to exploit vulnerabilities inherent in electronic voting 
i went to the texas secretary of state offices to ask mr ingram about specific procedural changes he has made in his  year tenure and the changes he attempted to make in august that would have gone into effect this november 
with camera  mic in hand we told the reception desk that we were with the press and would like to talk to the director about the election 
we were told to wait in the lobby and mr ingram would be down 
you can see for yourself what happened when he saw the mic flag showing we were with infowars 
the man running the election bureaucracy runs from questions 
so much for transparency and candor 
this unelected bureaucrat is tasked with ensuring that counties adhere to election law 
what follows are the specific actions taken by his office that waive requirements and undermine election integrity in texas 
but before we get to specifics about his actions  his connection to the rose law firm in arkansas there are some general questions that should concern voters nationwide 
 why would standards required by our elected lawmakers for election integrity be bent to the capabilities of vendors rather than require vendors to perform to the standard 
 why would election procedures be waived and honesty and transparency sacrificed for the convenience of election workers  officials 
burning the paper trail 
in august  ingram texas director of elections attempted to make last minute rule changes for the upcoming november  election that would eliminate crucial paper backup records for electronic voting his office issued new rules that would 
eliminate printing of paper audit logs that poll watchers are entitled to monitor at main tabulation computers 
eliminate printing of early voting results tapes 
eliminate printing of ballot images for recounts 
fortunately activists and some elected representatives got the proposed rule changes postponed with a formal public hearing scheduled after the november election 
state senator don huffines said the states chief election officers must reconsider and redraft their proposed election rules to pursue more realtime paper records and backups not fewerthe comfort  convenience of election administrators should not take priority over voters confidence and election integrity 
but even though these procedures have been postponed ingrams previous rule changes are still a cause for concern in the november election and have caused repercussions in two election cases currently being litigated here are some of the problems 
 waiver of laws requiring a partial manual recount audit 
ingram waived the requirement to conduct a manual count in  of the election precincts or  election precincts whichever is greater this was waived in all  counties the day after the march  primary the timing is significant because during the primary there were  move votes than voters in hill county in the republican primary the margin of victory was  in texas house district  that contains hill county in calling for a criminal investigation ingram noted that it appears  or  voters voted more than once in the election and one voter voted as many as four times yet he waived the partial manual recount audit requirement statewide and he has waived other audit and monitoring procedures 
 waiver of laws requiring printing of paper backup results tapes 
ingrams waivers issued in   and  appear to be in direct contradiction of state election laws      and the judges handbook these rules require   three original tally lists shall be maintained at the polling place to record the number of votes received for the candidates  on completion of the vote count the presiding judge shall prepare the returns of the election for the precinct with total number of voters total number of votes with the presiding judge signing each of the  copies to certify 
ingram also issued waivers for requirements that a zero tape be printed from the machines at the beginning of election day and a tally tape printed at the close of election his letter states that the process of printing of the zero tape and tally tape at each countywide precinct location could take hours in both the morning and the evening of election day 
so expediency for election workers takes precedent over requirements enacted by the legislature for integrity of elections and if a favored vendor cant perform to the law the law is waived 
if proper procedures had been followed to ensure that the machine was at a zero state instead of waived by ingram the hill county issue of  more voters than votes would not have happened the vendor in hill county ess eventually identified the source of the extra votes saying an audit of the log report from the central paper ballot scanner showed that the hard drive had not been properly cleared of all ballots cast before scanning early voting or election day ballotsthere are established election protocols which should be followed to prevent this type of reporting error 
but the director of elections is waiving those established election protocols ingrams waver of legal requirements  his improvised solution of printing a zero tape at the county warehouse prior to election day opens the door for error and fraud 
 ignoring laws requiring printing of legally sufficient ballot images for recounts 
the secretary of state election division claims that cast vote records are equivalent to ballot images as you can see the cast vote records are very different from ballots and are not uniquely numbered 
the texas constitution article   suffrage section  says in all elections by the people the vote shall be by ballot and the legislature shall provide for the numbering of tickets and make such other regulations as may be necessary to detect and punish fraud and preserve the purity of the ballot box 
yet the machines by vendors hart intercivic and ess certified by ingram do not provide uniquely numbered ballots per state recount laws and dont provide other components of a legal texas ballot 
 ignoring laws that allow poll watchers to monitor all election activities such as the printing of paper audit logs for computerized result tabultion 
texas election code sec  says a watcher is entitled to observe any activity conducted at the location at which the watcher is serving 
affidavits from two official poll watchers for a candidate in dallas county with official poll watcher signed forms detail how they were repeatedly obstructed from monitoring multiple election activities at the dallas county central counting station such as ballot scanning vote transfer ballot transfer computer activities ballot tabulation and viewing the elections computer line printer they state that they were repeatedly treated disrespectfully obstructed and blatantly ignored by the election officials and voting machine vendor before being thrown out after the officials spoke with the texas secretary of state elections office 
hostility to election monitors like ingrams refusal to answer our questions destroy the publics confidence in the honesty of the process  and rightfully so 
ingrams connections to arkansas kutak rock rose law firm  hillary clinton 
according to a public information request of ingrams secretary of state personnel file ingram left private practice and moved to little rock arkansas taking a job with the law firm kutak rock ll at kutak rock he worked under the managing partner gordon miller wilbourn who had been a partner with hillary clinton vince foster and webster hubbell at the rose law firm in arkansas in the s the wilbourn family is a large donor to the clinton foundation and the hillary clinton campaign 
ingram left kutak rock to return to texas when he was hired by gov rick perrys appointment office in  to oversee statewide political appointments for various courts boards  commissions 
ingramss career moves are interesting in just  months his journey from private practice in texas through arkansas clintoncronies and back to texas government resulted in pay cuts with each move and his salary being cut in half in  ingram was promoted to director of the election division in the texas secretary of states office where his salary was still  less than private practice 
ingrams determination to remove paper trails and auditing procedures for electronic voting is even more troubling when we look at his connections to big clinton donors 
establishment of both parties dont appear to want election integrity 
in one lawsuit contesting election results for austin city council the county could not produce any ballot images as required by law to conduct a recount computer logs had multiple corruptioninvalid errors during discovery it was learned that the computer counted more votes than registered voters in  of the  precincts forming the district one precinct had  voter turnout another was just  registered voters shy of  in spite of only  and  countywide turnout in the general and runoff elections 
the county democrat party has financed legal opposition to the lawsuit and a republican judge claimed there was no evidence for election irregularities 
there are some positive developments however the republican judge has now been voted off the bench of the solidly republican county and state legislators have taken up the question of election integrity that has so far been ignored by governor abbotts office 
state senator bob hall said due to an increasing number of complaints it is time for the texas elections division office to take immediate and decisive action to rescind all waivers issued by that officeand instruct all texas counties using electronic voting systems to consistently adhere to all election laws 
voters regardless of political affiliation should reject policies and personnel that compromise honest transparent elections for example chambers county in texas recently announced electronic voting would be suspended until the glitches affecting voting machines could be corrected its time to remove keith ingram as texas director of elections and replace easily hacked electronic voting machines with paper ballots",2016-10-26

870,levers of power flushing the vote down the memory hole,"kurds worried turkey will stab them in the back as they fight isis turkey publicly opposes isis while supporting them behind the scenes image credits kurdish ypg fighters kurdishstruggle  
two months after being purged from the border town of jarablus in northern syria by a turkishled force  and just days after being targeted by turkish airstrikes near albab  syrian kurds now fear a stab in the back from turkeys military as plans for a usled push to clear isis fighters from raqqa are carried out 
it is very important raqqa is liberated a chief political leader of the main syrian kurdish party the pyd told reuters  but one point which is bothering us is that if we go toward raqqa we will be stabbed from the back 
at the end of august turkish forces took part in a usled operation to eject isis from the northern border of syria once inside syria however turkish forces  leading free syrian army fsa rebels  took aim at kurdish fighters in the town of jarablus which sent them scurrying across the euphrates river in retreat 
the issue here is that the us claims to find the kurds useful in the fight against isis the kurds in fact make up a significant portion of one of the primary ussupplied rebel forces in the region as reuters explains  
kurdish militia have played a big role in the past year in the syrian democratic forces sdf a usbacked umbrella group as it has seized large areas of territory from islamic state laying the ground for an assault on raqqa 
however turkeys intervention in syria in august in support of rebel groups fighting under the free syrian army fsa banner has complicated that equation leading to clashes between them and kurdish groups allied to the sdf 
the problem is one of trust turkey believes the kurdish militants are aligned with the kurdish pyd party which the turks believe is allied with kurds within turkey whove been waging a religious insurgency for over three decades 
so regardless of whether the us finds the kurds useful turkey has made it clear it intends to sleep with one eye open for the foreseeable future in fact its taking a much more proactive stance than that 
last thursday in a campaign of airstrikes that were the heaviest against the ypg since turkey launched a military incursion into syria turkey targeted three kurdishcontrolled villages along the northern syrian border the turkish military later confirmed it had carried out  strikes on areas recently taken by the kurdish ypg militia and had killed between  and  combatants 
turkeys major concern is that kurdishcontrolled enclaves will physically unite thereby creating a de facto kurdish ministate along the turkish border as such turkey has warned kurds to keep out of towns like manjib which is just northeast of the heaviest fighting in aleppo

871,top clinton ally caught accepting k foreign donation,"store us government acknowledges that alqaeda is not a priority in syria one might ask then if alqaeda in syria is not a priority for the war on terror what is darius shahtahmasebi  anti media  october   comments 
last week the us state department acknowledged that alqaedalinked terror group jabhat alnusra is not a priority for the united states efforts in syria 
one might ask then if alqaeda in syria is not a priority for the war on terror what is 
state department spokesman john kirby provided some useful insight into this dilemma stating 
the only thing that stands between where we are now and a permanent and enduring ceasefire in syria is bashar alassad and his supporters  we recognize alnusra as a spoiler we have concerns about comingling ive talked about this ad nauseam 
largely missing from the american narrative of the syrian conflict is that alnusra is shelling residential areas in aleppo where the government holds control of the majority of aleppos citizens in other parts of the world these alqaedalinked extremists are seen as the enemy whereas in syria western media will often refer to them as mere rebel groups 
the united states first officially used the term war on terror on september   to refer to the military campaigns that followed the attacks of september  the stated aim at the time was to defeat islamiclinked terrorist organizations and dismantle regimes the us government accused of supporting terrorism 
in  obama stated  
 we must define our effort not as a boundless global war on terror but rather as a series of persistent targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten america 
the fact that a terror group  one linked to the organization that allegedly launched an act of war against the united states on american soil  is not a priority of the united states state department should tell you something about how farcical and ineffective the war on terror actually is 
this change in rhetoric which is ultimately designed to push ulterior economic agendas in the middle east is an insult to the thousands of soldiers who sacrificed their lives under the false pretense that they were going to protect their families from alqaedalinked terrorists newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",2016-10-26

to many who conduct work or research related to digital security the legislation meant to protect against computer crimes has morphed into something harmful the  law the us computer fraud and abuse act has been repeatedly described as vague and ineffectual  allowing overzealous prosecutors to saddle hacktivists and lowlevel criminals with excessive sentences

the department of justice acknowledges that laws addressing the misuse of computers have not kept pace uniformly with developments in technology and criminal schemes though it maintains that the law remains important in prosecuting cybercrimes

the federal government is trying to recoup enlistment bonuses given erroneously to thousands of california soldiers despite routinely allowing poorperforming va employees to keep their bonus checks

879,california national guard members wont have to pay back bonuses,"will china trigger the next global recession current debt level causes grave concern jing jin  misesorg   
chinas debt growth rate has become the focus of some discussions and fair enough from comparing the outright levels it may seem that china can collapse at any moment 
daniel fernandez suggested this in his article  has china reached its debt limit  in mises wire  in response to the governments monetary expansion stimulus plan after the  financial crisis chinas corporate sector did indeed leverage up quickly followed by an equally fast pace of leveraging in the household sector however in order to avoid comparing apples with oranges we need to take a closer look by putting these numbers into perspective using the same data source as used by fernandez we find that chinas total debt as a percentage of gdp was  percent by the end of  debttogdp ratio of corporate government and household sectors stood at  percent  percent and  percent respectively 
for government and household sectors both started from considerably low levels until the last administration kicked in a fourtrillion yuan rmb stimulus plan in  government debttogdp ratio which was kept in the mid s in the first decade of this millennium now stood at  percent by the end of  households debttogdp ratio was at  percent in  and almost doubled to  percent in  and then doubled again to  percent by the end of  the leveraging up of households happened exactly as the chinese society was undergoing rapid urbanization as well as when the government launched its  stimulus 
apart from the demand for urban housing chinese households with their high savings rate and extra cash in hands invested in in real estate as a hedge against future inflation furthermore as the stimulus package allowed for easier lending household debt increased dramatically however we must note that although the debt growth rate was high the absolute debt level of household is still considerably low versus global peers 
the most disturbing trend is found in the corporate sector with the debttogdp ratio increased from approximately  percent prior to  to  percent by the end of  first of all the level of corporate debt mostly in the form of bank loans was high to start with but is by no means out of the norm for a financial system dominated by the banking sector whose funding source is mostly deposits two figures from jonathan andersons how to think about china series provide some insights  
an international comparison of assets of banking system vs domestic saving rate 
breakdown of assets of chinas financial system 
this point can be further demonstrated by comparing financial asset structures for example between the us and china obviously bank loans are the dominant funding source of the corporate sector in china whereas in the us the role of bank loans is far from prominent in comparison with its enormous capital markets where the corporates can raise both equities and bond financing easily 
financial asset structure us vs china  
data source the world bank federal reserve bank shanghai stock exchange shenzhen stock exchange china central deposit and clearing co ltd ccdc sifma 
it is therefore not surprising that the leveraging up as a response to governments stimulus plan manifested itself mostly in the credit extension through the banking system chinas flat yield curve 
the large role of the banks can also be seen in chinas bond market yields and one manifestation of this is a flat yield curve  the reason for this is simple deposits when banks have more deposits to manage than they can lend out they invest these deposits into the bond market and usually on the long end to boost yields this investment strategy or assetliability management scheme bids up the bond prices on the long end hence pushing down the longterm yields 
in addition between allocating deposits to these two types of assets bonds vs loans banks sometimes have incentives to invest in bonds rather than lending due to the balancing considerations of corporate demand credit risks market liquidity and yields that are also subject to interest rate controls that are at final stage of liberalization and the lending rate was completely liberalized only in early  so the yield spread at current stage reflects more of the combination of chinas financial structure and capital flows rather than being a good indicator of economic fundamentals as the government flooded the market with four trillion rmb from the stimulus plan in  bond yields faced downward pressure more so at the longterm end please see the yields of chinese government treasury bonds at maturity  years vs  year and the spread thereof in the below figure wealth management products channel a considerable amount of deposits out of the banking system to capture higher yields outside of bankingsector supervision in form of trusts for example but the amount is still not pivotal enough to change the above explained pattern in a fundamental manner 
data source wind ccdc 
china didnt open up to the outside world until the very late s now china provides half of the manufacturing goods and close to half of electronic products in the world and the economy is still growing at around  percent obviously a good part of chinas production structure has been configured to export mostly to the developed economies which are dominated by the service sector as the global demand in the developed economies lost its momentum china faces the necessity of reconfiguring its economic structure to better serve its domestic consumers which stands at  times the number of us consumers this reconfiguration process is surely painful as demonstrated by the empty factories in the traditional export production oriented cities but to me this is more of a textbook case of austrian economics at work capital and labor have to be freed up for those productions currently being demanded by the market and this takes time moreover quick capital formation in the past three decades lifted labor productivity with which the manufacturing sector needs to be upgraded and the tertiary sector needs to be expanded to serve a more affluent society comparing with more than  years ago so that chinese consumers dont have to go to japan to buy hitech toilet lids  a healthier skepticism of stimulus 
needless to say the current debt level causes concern and the deeper concern is whether debt growth trajectory will continue ultimately whether or not the debt will grow at the rate of post  stimulus phase is a function of how fast the chinese government runs the money printing press a recent article on the peoples daily  the mouthpiece of china communist party ccp  quoted the diagnosis from an authoritative figure on the chinese economy and its cure this authoritative figure suggested there should be no more money printing to stimulate the economy and that the chinese should be prepared for a lower growth rate comparing with its own historical average of  percent anyone with an understanding of chinas political messaging system would not be mistake it for anything but an opinion handed down from the very top of chinese leadership this can be considered a concluding remark on the policy swings for the past several years 
the xinhua news agency the mainstream media group recently followed with a commentary suggesting resistance to the use of stimulus plans in the face of slowing growth xinhua also warned of a disastrous result if its advice is not followed messages like these are refreshing to hear nowadays among the mantra of the stimulus chorus around the world how chinas policy direction is to be implemented remains to be seen but at least the insidious effects of stimulus is well recognized by those at the top of the regime and openly represented by mainstream media in addition a series of measures to lower tax burdens for corporate and households alike are also being introduced and the central government is pushing hard for businessfriendly deregulations and increasing economic freedom 
china has its problems tons of them china may or may not be the first to blow up in the coming wave of crises as many people say no matter whichever the case i am more convinced that china will be among the first ones to revive  because it has high savings to invest it has a welltrained labor force with one of the most vibrant if not the most complete manufacturing chain and the manufacturing sector still contributes to over  percent of its gdp it is still in the middle of a rapid urbanization process it is not yet a welfare state chinese people are fully aware of the fact that their safety net is the result of their own frugality rather than government promises china has the biggest potential market of  billion people with a rising middleclass that is still increasing in numbers and share in population serving them well is one of the biggest business opportunities in the st century

could we see violence no matter who wins on november th lets hope that it doesnt happen but as you will see below antitrump violence is already sweeping the nation 
if trump were to actually win the election that would likely send the radical left into a violent postelection temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before alternatively there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by hillary clinton and as i showed yesterday it appears that voting machines in texas are already switching votes from donald trump to hillary clinton  if hillary clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country 
at this moment there is less than two weeks to go until november th and a brand new survey has found that a majority of americans are concerned about the possibility of violence on election day 
a  majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on election day one in five are very concerned three of four say they have confidence that the united states will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked american democracy for more than  years but just  say they are very confident about that 
more than four in  of trump supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of clinton as president if she prevails because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square 
but many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence on wednesday donald trumps star on the walk of fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pickax 
donald trump took a lot of hits today and not just in the presidential race with less than two weeks to go before america decides if the ex apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over hillary clinton trumps star on the hollywood walk of fame was destroyed early wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pickax in what looks to be a tinseltown first 
and there were two other instances earlier this year when donald trumps star was also vandalized one came in january and the other happened in june  
this is of course not the first time the gop candidates star has been attacked or defaced since trump announced his white house bid in summer  the most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at  hollywood blvd in late january in june this summer a mute sign was painted on trumps star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign in both cases trumps star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day 
we have seen antitrump violence on the east coast as well earlier this month someone decided to firebomb the republican party headquarters in orange county north carolina on the building next to the headquarters someone spraypainted nazi republicans get out of town or else along with a swastika 
there have also been other disturbing incidents of antitrump violence all over the nation in recent days a recent lifezette article put together quite a long list and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece 
on oct  in bangor maine vandals spraypainted about  parked cars outside a trump rally trump supporter paul foster whose van was hit with white paint told reporters why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars all of this to make their statement 
around oct  a couple of trump supporters were assaulted in zeitgeist a san francisco bar after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for trump gotnews reports the two trump supporters were attacked punched and chased into the street by some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back lilian kim of abc  bay area tweeted a photo of the men in which one was wearing a trump tshirt and the other was wearing a blue lives matter shirt 
on sept  in el cajon california an angry mob at a black lives matter protest beat yearold trump supporter feras jabro for wearing a make america great again baseball cap the assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app periscope 
there is a move to get trump supporters to wear red on election day but in many parts of america that might just turn his supporters into easy targets lets certainly hope that we dont see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating 
of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad and a hillary clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge 
for example this week former congressman joe walsh said that he is grabbing my musket if donald trump loses the election 
former rep joe walsh appeared to call for armed revolution wednesday if donald trump is not elected president 
walsh a former tea party congressman from illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host tweeted on november th im voting for trump on november th if trump loses im grabbing my musket you in 
and without a doubt many ordinary americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case hillary clinton is victorious the following comes from usa today  
since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards hillary clinton ive been buying a lot more ammunition says rick darling  an engineer from harrison township in michigans detroit suburbs in a followup phone interview after being surveyed the trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election 
today america is more divided than i have ever seen it before and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another 
ironically donald trump has been working very hard to bring america together in fact he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any republican presidential candidate since   
if hillary clinton and the democrats win on november th things will not go well for hillary clintons political enemies the clintons used the power of the white house to go after their enemies the first time around and hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then 
and the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are this is something that i discussed on national television earlier this month  
as i write this it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a hillary clinton presidency would be 
but at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome  
out of all the candidates that we could have chosen the american people are about to put the most evil one by far into the white house 
perhaps donald trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate but time is rapidly slipping away and november th will be here before we know it newsletter sign up",2016-10-26

a new poll released by gallup has found that a record amount of americans are opposed to gun control measures  
the survey found that  percent of respondents over three quarters believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law 
the findings represent a fourpoint increase on the same survey from last year in addition to an alltime high for the past three decades 
the poll also found that almost two thirds  percent are against a ban on semiautomatic rifles or assault weaponsas the corporate media refers to them 
that figure represents a full tenpoint increase on previous findings and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue  years ago 
just  percent less than a third say they support a ban on handgun ownership while only  percent support a semiautomatic ban an eightpoint decline on previous findings 
in addition gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end 
in a summary of the new poll gallup seemed surprised by the findings describing waning support for a gun ban as a paradox 
perhaps paradoxically opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles these guns were used in highprofile incidents including the terrorist attacks in san bernardino california and orlando and the mass shootings in aurora colorado and newtown connecticut 
the findings reveal just how out of step hillary clintons position on gun control is with the majority of americans 
hillary is a staunch gun control proponent wikileaks releases have revealed that hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order

china has experienced such a growth rate of hiv in the past several years that one university has taken steps to allow students to test themselves by placing an hiv testing kit in a vending machine next to regular fare like snacks 
china has seen a  yearoveryear increase in infection rates which likely prompted southwest petroleum university in nanchong city in sichuan province to install the test kits  
sichuan province is one of the top three provinces in china with a disproportionately high rate of hivaids together with the other two provinces that have high rates of the disease the three account for over half of the cases of hivaids in the entire country 
 of new hiv cases occur due to homosexual activity 
the kits retail for  and can be taken as a urine test to determine whether or not students need to seek medical attention those who purchase the test will collect their urine and send it to a laboratory and then access the results online this can all be done completely anonymously 
similar kits can be purchased online but they retail for around  the cheaper vending machine tests are just as accurate and are partially subsidized by a charity to allow the test to be more accessible 
reports state that the chinese have limited sex education and very little is discussed about hiv or aids many students who suspect they may have the disease do not seek medical help because of its link to homosexuality those who do have hiv are often thought to be pariahs by their families and friends because of its connection with samesex encounters 
the disease is mostly spreading amongst young homosexual men but as with anywhere else women who do not use proper protection are also susceptible to becoming infected 
doctors have stated that most young people who have become infected with hivaids in china lacked proper education and did not take appropriate precautions for prevention 
the joint united nations programme on hivaids unaids states that there are currently about half a million people in china living with hiv or aids however this figure may be inaccurate due to underreporting",2016-10-27

898,hillary is a real christian says michael moore,"public faith in elections falls as the state grows outofcontrol state power ryan mcmaken  misesorg  october   comments 
in the wake of the final presidential election debate last week the mainstream media was appalled that donald trump would not preemptively agree to not contest the outcome of the election  
trumps position reflects a growing faction of americans who doubt the integrity and honesty of the american electoral system in response mainstream media sources have responded by vehemently insisting that rigged elections are  a myth  
while rarely stated explicitly the way american electoral politics is supposed to work is this the population spends several months listening to the candidates accuse each other of terrible crimes horrible ideas and gross incompetence each candidate lists the ways he or she will use the power of government to force the winners policy preferences on the losers then once the votes are cast everyone is supposed to quickly accept the results ignore everything that was said during the campaign and immediately accept the winner as having an indisputable mandate to rule over everyone including the sizable minority  or even the majority in many cases  who either voted against the winner or abstained if there appears to be any irregularities in the vote well those should just be ignored because it would tear the country apart to drag out the election if half the country feels its been cheated well tough luck and better luck next time democracy breaks down as perceived interventionism increases 
this model can only work indefinitely under certain specific conditions it can be workable when there is a perception that government is limited in its power and extensive or abrupt change to government institutions are thought to be rare it can also work in a small culturally uniform society where there is a relatively small divide between socioeconomic and ethnic groups 
in the case of the united states however it appears that neither of these conditions apply 
in the age of presidential executive orders militarized police uncountable federal laws and a myriad of spy agencies empowered to watch americans every move gone is the perception that a loss in an electoral contest should simply be accepted without question the president says he can issue laws with  a pen and  a phone  without any need to consult congress the libya war proved presidents can invade any country without so much as a debate in congress meanwhile the untouchable supreme court hands down decisions that are equivalent to constitutional amendments some of which can have enormous effects on the daily lives of ordinary citizens 
in other words the stakes are now reaching the point where an attitude of better luck next time doesnt cut it whether or not these fears are at times overstated is irrelevant the fact is the perception of democratic lawlessness is growing 
this situation is further complicated by the fact that the united states is an enormous conglomeration of different cultural and socioeconomic groups spread out over a vast and varied geography many of these different groups distrust each other and in a country where the president and the judiciary now rule largely by proclamation there is reason to be fearful when the other guys candidate wins and yours loses democracy can work when the stakes are low 
contrary to the naive musings of some nostalgic conservatives the united states was never united into a single cultural linguistic or socioeconomic group those differences may have reached a low point during the twentieth century but they were far larger in the th century than they are today 
when you have a diverse population however the problem of who controls the government becomes far more important and this concern grows as the state becomes more powerful writing on the topic of immigration and nationalism in australia  ludwig von mises noted how powerful states exacerbate the problem of cultural divides could a laissezfaire regime be guaranteed to all residents of australia mises notes it would not matter at all if there were cultural mistrust between englishdescended australians and asian newcomers however since laissezfaire liberalism has not been embraced a familiar problem presented itself 
the present inhabitants of australia fear that some day they could be reduced to a minority in their own country and that they would then have to suffer all the horrors of national persecution to which for instance the germans are today ie the early s exposed in czechoslovakia italy and poland 
it cannot be denied that these fears are justified because of the enormous power that today stands at the command of the state a national minority must expect the worst from a majority of a different nationality as long as the state is granted the vast powers which it has today and which public opinion considers to be its right the thought of having to live in a state whose government is in the hands of members of a foreign nationality is positively terrifying it is frightful to live in a state in which at every turn one is exposed to persecution  masquerading under the guise of justice  by a ruling majority it is dreadful to be handicapped even as a child in school on account of ones nationality and to be in the wrong before every judicial and administrative authority because one belongs to a national minority 
it is clear that no solution of the problem of immigration is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state which meddles in every field of human activity or to that of the socialist state only the adoption of the liberal program could make the problem of immigration which today seems insoluble completely disappear in an australia governed according to liberal principles what difficulties could arise from the fact that in some parts of the continent japanese and in other parts englishmen were in the majority 
these same principles can be applied outside the subject of immigration as well the existence of an interventionist state means any country composed of diverse ethnic and socioeconomic groups faces the same problem of one group being exploited by another group with the help of state power change the term nationality to political party or interest groups and one has a fair approximation of the problem of democracy in any interventionist state 
in the presence of a relatively weak government however these concerns are often overstated at the turn of the th century in the us for example the fact that spanishspeakers were in the majority in new mexico and many areas of the american west was irrelevant to the lives of the vast majority of americans the fact that japanese immigrants and their descendant were outcompeting white businessmen in california was simply not a matter of national importance the fact that oregon attempted to outlaw catholic schools was not a matter for presidential executive orders thanks to widespread suspicion of federal power at the time the lack of a strong federal judiciary and a relatively weak presidency meant these issues remained largely local while public policy was haphazard 
voters have always feared losses in elections but now more than ever the voters may be justified in refusing to simply accept the outcomes of elections under an interventionist state which meddles in every field of human activity when that is the case elections are not something to be taken lightly trumps remarks about rigged elections  and public fears over the outcome  are to be expected from voters with an immense fear of outofcontrol state power 
in response to all of this the pundits and government class will tell us that everyone must double down on democracy and that elections  specifically federal ones are sacred rituals never to be questioned there will be a double standard of course a trump victory will be questioned by the media and powerful politicians but in that case it will be the fault of the russians  and not anything wrong with the system itself the solution for the feds of course will be a federal takeover of the election system if clinton wins then no questioning of the system will be tolerated at all to question the outcome or the wisdom of these presidential contests will be denounced as scarcely less than sacrilege 
the true solution to the problem remains far more practical however to paraphrase mises it is clear that no solution of the problem of elections is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state so long as elections are increasingly perceived to be referenda on which side shall use the power of the state to crush the other side faith in the electoral system will erode and the potential for real violence will increase newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",2016-10-27

900,monopoly banks then media now voting machine companies,"who cancer agency under fire for withholding carcinogenic glyphosate documents iarc urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its  weedkiller glyphosate review rtcom  october   comments 
the international agency for research on cancer iarc facing criticism over its classification of carcinogens has reportedly been advising its scientific experts not to publish internal research data on its  report on probably carcinogenic glyphosate 
the iarc urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its  weedkiller glyphosate review according to reuters the agency told reuters on tuesday that it tried to protect the study from external interference as well as protect its intellectual rights since it was the sole owner of such materials 
the scientists had been asked earlier to release all the documentation on the  report under us freedom of information laws 
the groundbreaking review published in march  by the iarc  a semiautonomous agency of the world health organization who  labeled the glyphosate herbicide as probably carcinogenic to humans glyphosate is a key ingredient of monsantos flagship weedkiller wellknown under the trade name roundup it is one of the most heavily used herbicides in the world and is designed to go along with geneticallymodified roundup ready crops also produced by monsanto 
the iarcs report caused problems for both the notorious agrochemical giant and the agency itself 
the report sparked a heated debate around the use of roundup and caused several eu countries  including france sweden and the netherlands  to object to the renewal of the glyphosates eu license the vote on prolonging the glyphosate license for  years failed several times in june  but the license was temporarily extended for  months during last hours before its expiration 
the controversial report has seemingly made the iarc a target for attacks from multiple directions and raised scientific legal and financial questions 
various critics including those in the chemical industry said the iarcs evaluations are fuel for unnecessary health scares since the iarc allegedly studies the potentially harmful substance itself and not a typical human exposure to it it remained unclear whether the critics urged a who body to test the potentially carcinogenic chemical on humans 
the critics also brought up other controversial statements from the iarc over whether such things as mobile phones coffee red meat and processed meat could cause cancer 
the agency defended its methods as scientifically sound and widely respected for their scientific rigor standardized and transparent process andfreedom from conflicts of interest numerous freedom of information requests by the energy  environment legal institute ee legal a us conservative advocacy group have since been turned down with this reasoning 
ee legal told reuters that it is pushing a legal challenge over whether the documents in question belong to the iarc or to the us federal and state institutions where some of the experts work basically its being decided whether the iarc as part of the who is truly independent and free from conflicts of interest 
according to reuters officials from the us national institutes of health nih will be questioned by a congressional committee about why american taxpayers fund the cancer agency which faces much criticism over its allegedly faulty classification of carcinogens 
iarcs standards and determinations for classifying substances as carcinogenic and therefore cancercausing appear inconsistent with other scientific research and have generated much controversy and alarm a letter from us oversight committee chairman jason chaffetz to nih director francis collins states as quoted by reuters 
the oversight committee demanded a full disclosure of nih funding of the iarc and even money spent in relation to the cancer agencys activities 
iarc opponents from scientific circles vowed to provide their data on the matter the european food safety authority efsa which believes glyphosate is unlikely pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans promised to release its raw data on the subject as part of its commitment to open risk assessment the food safety watchdog made this statement in late september and still has to deliver the promised information newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",2016-10-27

recent studies have confirmed that a variety of environmental factors are at play when it comes to dementia 
doctors have noted that those who are deficient in vitamin d are  more likely to develop dementia than those who get in the necessary amount 
a vitamin d deficiency can also be associated with brittle or soft bones as well as depression it is recommended that everyone gets at least  minutes of sunlight per day in order to ensure they have enough vitamin d as well as eat fortified dairy products or salmon liver and red meat vitamin d can also be obtained through supplementation or fish oil 
however doctors have found that the biggest environmental risk for dementia lies in air pollution 
in fact the problem is so great that those who live in a city with high pollution can double their risk of develop dementia within  or  months living there 
recent studies have also shown that postmortem examinations of the brains of those who have lived in highly polluted areas contain traces of magnetite this chemical compound may be partially responsible for the memory impairments associated with dementia 
the risk of developing dementia if you are exposed to air pollution increases exponentially if you are obese 
researchers say that those concerned about the epidemic can combat it by living somewhere with as little pollution as possible maintaining a health intake of vitamin d and exercising 
according to research exercise is imperitive when it comes to staving off the illness dr laura baker who ran a study on dementia and exercise stated

everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict assange said via telephone at a conference in argentina on wednesday 
the whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from clintons campaign chair john podesta on a daily basis since early october 
assange claimed the release whipped up a crazed hornets nest atmosphere in the hillary clinton campaign leading them to attack wikileaks 
 they attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the un and british courts to accuse me of being both a russian spy and a pedophile he added 
ecuadors decision to shut down his internet was described by assange as a strategic position so that its policy of nonintervention cant be misinterpreted by actors in the us and even domestically in ecuador 
he said he was sympathetic with ecuador insisting they face the dilemma of having the us interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the us elections next month 
assange who claimed the embassy will be without internet until the election is over to avoid accusations of interference said he did not agree with ecuadors decision but did understand it wikileaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from ecuador he said 
he did however reject the idea that wikileaks is interfering with the us election claiming this is not the interference of electoral process this is the definition of electoral process  for media organizations and in fact everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring it cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform 
he also attacked us tv networks many of whom he accused of being controlled by clinton supporters 
the podesta emails will make no difference to the election result according to assange i dont think theres any chance of donald trump winning the election even with the amazing material we are publishing because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with hillary clinton he said

speaking with infowars david pourshoushtari communications director for the colorado state senate democrats said kerr was unaware of the hack but that the senator declined to provide an official statement until the situation could be assessed 
while the exact reasoning behind the hack is currently unknown kerr may have been targeted as part of the same hacking campaign that compromised the emails of other political figures including clinton campaign chairman john podesta 
it is also unclear whether kerr like podesta fell victim to a phishing attack that would have resulted in the senator putting his email password into a fake google login page

abc claims its a point race with clinton ahead after polling a random national sample of  likely voters but the polls methodology reveals the poll was heavily biased in favor of hillary 
results have a margin of sampling error of  points including the design effect partisan divisions are  percent democratsrepublicansindependents abc said near the bottom of the poll 
of course hillary will be ahead in polls dominated by democrats but abc and other mainstream media outlets are betting that voters wont bother to look at a polls methodology to find the bias 
even if theres more registered democrats than republicans nationally they dont outnumber them by nearly  because otherwise republicans wouldnt be winning national races 
these kind of misleading polls really strike at their credibility as pollsters wrote media analyst aaron rossiter they seem to want the big hillary lead probably to throw off the poll averages and suppress republican voter turnout

915,after vets fight war feds demand money back,"bill clintons son danney williams has youtube channel restored youtube had deactivated channel hosting popular documentary linking williams to bill clinton infowarscom  october   comments 
youtube has decided to reverse its ban on a channel registered by a man who claims to be bill clintons longlost son 
your youtube account was suspended due to repeated or severe violations of our terms and our community guidelines and as such cannot be restored the company wrote earlier this week to danney williams after he filed an appeal to restore his channel 
for decades williams has been on a mission to reunite with the person he believes to be his biological father the nd president of the united states william jefferson clinton 
the most popular video on the channel  a nineminute minidocumentary posted two weeks ago produced by filmmaker joel gilbert features the yearold williams recounting memories from his childhood which prompted the search for his father 
arguing the channel had absolutely zero violations of any kind gilbert places blame for the suspension squarely at google and the clinton campaigns feet 
its obvious to me that the fix is in gilbert wrote in a statement the only possible explanation is that the clinton campaign requested youtubegoogle to silence danny to run him off the plantation as danny said hillary clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the arkansas governors mansion in  
youtube later restored williams channel early thursday morning claiming a review confirmed it was not in violation of its terms of service 
last week danney went to las vegas  the site of the third us presidential debate  where he held a press conference alongside his lawyers announcing his intention to seek a dna sample from bill clinton in order to settle the paternity dispute 
danney and his lawyers claim a previous dna test carried out by the tabloid star magazine failed to obtain a blood sample from clinton an assertion confirmed by one of stars former editors to world net daily  
i dont remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on clintons dna former star magazine editor phil bunton stated to wnd

920,shocking michele obama  hillary caught glamorizing date rape promoters,"most top retailers sell food produced with beekilling pesticides only aldi costco and whole foods got passing grades julie fidler  infowarscom  october   comments 
a new scorecard report gives a failing grade to  out of  major food retailers in the united states based on their policies and practices regarding pollinator protection organic options and pesticide reduction  source friends of the earth 
tiffany finckhaynes food futures campaigner with friends of the earth said 
us food retailers must take responsibility for how the products they sell are contributing to the bee crisis 
the majority of the food sold at top us food retailers is produced with pollinatortoxic pesticides we urge all major retailers to work with their suppliers to eliminate pollinatortoxic pesticides and to expand domestic organic offerings that protect pollinators people and the planet  organic offerings and transparency are lacking 
the report swarming the aisles rating top retailers on beefriendly and organic food is the work of a coalition led by friends of the earth and more than  farmer beekeeper farmworker environmental and public interest organizations  
the coalition sent a letter urging food retailers to eliminate pesticides that are toxic to bees and other pollinators  and increase us department of agriculture usda certified organic food and beverages to  of overall offerings by  the group would like to see retailers prioritize domestic regional and local producers 
friends of the earth and its allies have been successful in the past at convincing more than  garden retailers including lowes and home depot to commit to eliminate pollinatortoxic neonicotinoid neonic pesticides 
according to haynes the demand for organic foods has grown by doubledigits  but grocers arent keeping up she said 
a lot of the major food retailers have started to increase their organic offerings but few of them have really adopted clear goals or metrics to continue to significantly increase their organic food offerings in the future  
as evidenced by the groups research its difficult for the public to know where retailers stand concerning pesticide use and organic food eleven of the  retailers websites examined by friends of the earth dont provide basic information concerning their policies on organic food pollinators andor pesticides  haynes said adding 
theres a lot that retailers could do by adopting creative programs with their supply chain to help farmers grow their organic offerings and then be able to sell that in their stores americans are ready for change 
a yougov poll released  october  by friends of the earth and sumofus reveals that  of americans believe neonics should not be used in agriculture  and  of those who do the grocery shopping for their household would be more likely to shop at a store that has made a formal commitment to eliminate neonicotinoids  
additionally the poll shows that  of respondents believe its important for supermarkets to sell organic food another  said theyd likely spend more time at a different grocery store if it sold more organic food than the store they currently frequent 
said angus wong lead campaign strategist at sumofus a consumer watchdog with ten million members 
over  sumofus members have spoken out advocating that us hardware stores take action to protect our pollinators and after years of pressure home depot and lowes have finally enacted more beefriendly policies 
and the findings of this poll show that a vast majority of consumers want to eliminate neonicotinoids from their grocery stores too this is why food retailers must commit policies that protect our bees immediately 
only four of the nations top food retailers  albertsons costco target and whole foods  have adopted and made public a companywide commitment to increase offerings of certified organic food  they are also the only retailers to disclose data on the current percentage of organic food they offer or organic sales 
aldi food lion part of the delhaize group and kroger disclosed data on the current percentage of organic offerings or organic sales 
none of the retailers that the group looked at have publicly committed to sourcing organic food from american farmers  retailer apathy is killing pollinators 
of the top  food retailers surveyed by friends of the earth a shocking  were predominantly unresponsive to friends of the earths requests for information via surveys calls and letters the group was forced to turn to publicly available information including company websites company annual reports us securities and exchange commission filings corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports press coverage and industry analyses for their data 
we have bees to thank for every  in  bites of food we take  and without bees stores would run low on everything from strawberries to almonds source bee cause 
science increasingly points to neonicotinoid pesticides as a leading cause of pollinator decline glyphosate the main ingredient in monsantos blockbuster herbicide roundup has been shown to play a significant role in monarch butterfly declines  
several us cities have banned neonics including boulder city colorado  and portland oregon  this past spring maryland became the first state to ban the pesticides

do the committees that oversee the vast us spying apparatus take intelligence community whistleblowers seriously do they earnestly investigate reports of waste fraud abuse professional negligence or crimes against the constitution reported by employees or contractors working for agencies like the cia or nsa for the last  years the answer has been a resounding no 
my own experience in  is illustrative over a twoyear period working with my wife robin who was a cia detailee to a senate committee at the time we discovered that contrary to the public statements by thenchairman of the joint chiefs colin powell and other senior george h w bush administration officials including cia director john deutch american troops had in fact been exposed to chemical agents during and after the  war with saddam hussein while the senate banking committee under thenchairman don riegle dmich was trying to uncover the truth of this officials at the pentagon and cia were working to bury it 
at the cia i objected internally  and was immediately placed under investigation by the cias office of security that became clear just days after we delivered the first of our several internal briefings to increasingly senior officials at the cia and other intelligence agencies in february  i received a phone call from cia security asking whether id had any contacts with the media i had not but i had mentioned to cia officials wed met with that i knew that the cbs newsmagazine  minutes was working on a piece about the gulf war chemical coverup this call would not be the last id receive from cia security about the matter nor the only action the agency would take against us 
in the spring of  a former manager of robins discreetly pulled her aside and said that cia security agents were asking questions about us talking to every single person with or for whom either of us had worked i seemed to be the special focus of their attention and the last question they asked our friends colleagues and former managers was do you believe pat eddington would allow his conscience to override the secrecy agreement he signed",2016-10-28

927,why every man must take control of his finances,"statistical tie latest breitbartgravis poll shows donald trump closes the gap with less than two weeks left clinton at  percent leads trump at  percent by just one point breitbart  october   comments 
new york city new york  donald j trump the republican nominee for president has closed the gap with his democratic opponent hillary rodham clinton with just a couple weeks left in the election the latest national breitbart news networkgravis marketing poll shows 
clinton at  percent leads trump at  percent by just one pointinside the surveys  percent margin of error libertarian gary johnson gets just  percent and the green partys dr jill stein just  percent while  percent are unsure the survey was conducted from oct  to oct  sampling  registered voters across the united states the poll was conducted using a combination of interactive voice response polling and an internet panel of cell phone users 
something has happened since the third debate doug kaplan the managing partner of gravis marketing said of the poll conventional wisdom was after trump said he wouldnt promise to accept the results of the election and made the nasty woman comment many thought hillary would gainbut trump seems to be closing the gap in every election in the last  years this happens where the person behind closes the gap hillary still has a clear electoral advantage and many paths to victory however trump is not out of it but hillary is still the favorite 
this is a big story because it shows trump really closing importantly as the other close polls are showing democratic pollster pat caddell who worked for president jimmy carter and is working with breitbart news and gravis marketing on these polls added he is closing with his favorability and unfavorability as well 
caddell said he thinks obamacares failures where premiums are skyrocketing is one of many reasons why trump is surging among other things that is contributing to trumps rise in the polls caddell said when we are looking down the road at other things that may be influential we are seeing the possibility of again on the immigration issuethat thing about concern on the border seems to be increasing as is opposition to hillary and their plans to expand immigration and refugees which is another big issue but more importantly at the end of the survey we see both candidates have problems on their ability to unite the country and on whether or not they can have the moral leadership to lead theyre basically about the same which i consider a real improvement for trump now that hes that close",2016-10-28
928,the great american screwjob,"schools all over america are closing on election day due to fears of violence all it is going to take is a single incident to change everything image credits flickr calibeach  
will this be the most chaotic election day in modern american history 
all across the nation schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears traditionally schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people they usually have lots of parking and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily but now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place according to fox news  voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on election day at schools in illinois maine nebraska new hampshire ohio pennsylvania wisconsin and elsewhere just a couple days ago  i shared with you a survey that found that  percent of all americans are concerned about violence happening on election day and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach november th 
many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence the following comes from fox news  
several schools across the nation have decided to close on election day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail 
the fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways endangering students 
if anybody can sit there and say they dont think this is a contentious election then they arent paying much attention ed tolan the falmouth maine police chief said tuesday his community has already called off classes on nov  and an increased police presence will be felt around town 
and without a doubt voting locations are soft targets that often have little or no security we have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past but we also need to realize that times have changed i believe that there is wisdom in what georgia secretary of state brian kemp told reporters  
there is a concern just like at a concert sporting event or other public gathering that we didnt have  or  years ago said georgia secretary of state brian kemp cochairman of the national association of secretaries of state election committee  what if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something if that happens at a school then thats certainly concerning 
all it is going to take is a single incident to change everything 
let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that 
another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud this is something that donald trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail for instance just consider what he told a rally in pennsylvania  
we dont want to lose an election because you know what im talking about trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in manheim pa earlier this month because you know what thats a big big problem and nobody wants to talk about it nobody has the guts to talk about it so go and watch these polling places  
and of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines in illinois this week one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from republicans to democrats 
early voting in illinois got off to a rocky start monday as votes being cast for republican candidates were transformed into votes for democrats 
republican state representative candidate jim moynihan went to vote monday at the schaumburg public library 
i tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent moynihan said you could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when i tried to vote for a republican and the machine registered a vote for a democrat 
in addition if you keep up with my work on the economic collapse blog  then you already know that a number of voters down in texas have reported that their votes were switched from donald trump to hillary clinton  
well it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the clinton foundation  
according to opensecrets the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of the mccarthy group 
the mccarthy group is a major donor to the clinton foundation  apparently donating  dollars in   when it was the largest owner of united states voting machines or perhaps the  dollars went to paying bill clinton for speeches 
either way it doesnt look good 
after everything that we saw in   i am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines 
but democrats dont like poll observers because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters 
its unamerican but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that  ari berman author of the  book  give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in america  previously told the christian science monitor voting was very very dangerous i dont think anyones suggesting that were at the same place today i just think the loss of the official poll observers is going to be really problematic 
without a doubt this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades and i have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier 
but will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country  
if that is the outcome after all that we have been through it will be exceedingly depressing indeed newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",2016-10-27

islamic indoctrination is now mandatory in german schools 
from the daily express  
pupils at a primary school were forced to chant allahu akhbar and there is no god but allah an appalled father has claimed 
the father of the pupil at the girls primary school in german ski resort garmischpartenkirchen discovered that his daughter had been forced to learn the islamic prayer when he discovered a handout she had been given 
he claimed she had been forced by teachers to memorise the islamic chants and forwarded the handout to austrian news service unsertirol 
the handout read oh allah how perfect you are and praise be to you blessed is your name and exalted is your majesty there is no god but you 
it had been given to the girl during a lesson in ethics at the bavarian school 
what are they going to teach the ethics of conquest and slavery 
heres another story from yesterday in rt  
parents of a german teenager may face a trial and fine for truancy after refusing to allow their son to go to a local mosque on a school field trip out of fear that it would lead to his indoctrination by islamic radicals 
the story broke in midjune when parents of a yearold student opposed the idea of their son visiting a mosque in the northern german town of rendsburg reportedly organized as part of a geography class 
in a letter to the class teacher quoted by the ndr the teens father argued that his son would be indoctrinated in the mosque he went on to say that for years we have been hearing reports about religiouslymotivated violence connected with islamic people 
a local education authority subsequently fined the couple a total of   referring to school regulations and regional laws which include penalties for truancy 
 alexandra witt alexiastellar october   
when the parents opposed the fine their case was forwarded to peter muellerrakow a local prosecutor who will decide whether or not to proceed with a court trial spiegel reported on wednesday 
the parents lawyer alexander heumann argues that they refused the school trip out of fear for their sons bodily safety 
denying any faithbased motives he emphasized that the couple do not belong to any religious group and are of the opinion that nobody shall be forced into a sacred place against his good will 
school principal renate fritzsche  told ndr that the field trip to the mosque was meant to promote tolerance and diversity 
we also have muslim children with us and muslim parents also know that there are no exceptions she said adding that swimming lessons and sex education are compulsory for muslim children as well it is not the responsibility of the parents to say my child will attend such or such class fritzsche asserted

hillary clinton and the democrats have begun stealing the election using every underhanded tactic because its the only way she can win says clinton insider larry nichols 
shes going to lose and she knows it nichols said on the alex jones show thursday unless she can amass and pull off the biggest amount of voter fraud in the history of this country 
nichols explained that the establishment is already doing what it can to prevent an open and transparent election 
the dnc filed a lawsuit to try to force the removal of poll watchers at the polls he said why would they do that if they know theres no cheating going on why would they fight the voter id if they dont plan to have massive voter fraud 
the mainstream media and the clinton campaign are also doing everything they can up until election day to make everybody believe that the election is already over in hillarys favor nichols said 
folks do not believe it he said the polling is a part of this game plan to destroy your confidence in your ability to win 
i believe donald trump is winning nichols added youre winning youve just got to stay the course 
nichols warned that voters must take extra steps to ensure their vote isnt being altered 
youve got to make people at the precinct prove that your vote was recorded properly he said if they cant show you proof then demand a paper ballot 
the damning videos provided by project veritas exposing highlevel democrat operatives discussing how they steal elections illustrate that worries about voter fraud arent unfounded with even the new york times acknowledging a recent survey showing that most voters fear their ballot wont count because they believe the political process is so dominated by corporate interests newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",2016-10-28

a new study found that women have caught up with men as the heavy drinkers over the past  years 
bmj open released their journal that came to the conclusion that women are drinking more alcohol than men and it is having health ramifications the study which looked at over  million people over a period of over a century suggested that this is a result from successful marketing campaigns and sweeter alcoholic products being designed for younger women 
these results have implications for the framing and targeting of alcoholuse prevention and intervention programs alcohol use and alcoholuse disorders have historically been viewed as a male phenomenon the present study calls this assumption into question and suggests that young women in particular should be the target of concerted efforts to reduce the impact of substance use and related harms the researchers stated in the news release",2016-10-28

one might think big pharma garners most of its profit peddling pills for more wellknown diseases but new research shows that pharmaceutical companies are instead searching for the next big thing in rare diseases 
big pharmas profit margins continue to rise considerably with rarer diseases simply because they can charge more for the pills than they do for medication for more common ailments 
the search for the next moneymaker within rare diseases has actually halted some of the advancements for more common ailments which may explain why they still havent discovered a cure for some of the most common diseases affecting the worlds population 
in  the orphan drug act started to incentivize the creation of drugs for rarer diseases to ensure that those suffering from uncommon conditions were not neglected in new scientific research simply because the drugs werent as profitable 
because of the incentives which include reduced taxes and reduced or waived regulatory fees over  new drugs for uncommon diseases have hit the market since the law was introduced 
for common illnesses big pharma can get still turnover big profits while not charging a fortune for the drug for example liptior atorvastatin which is used to regulate cholesterol generates a sales profit of  billion with the prescription only costing patients around  per day 
but with rare diseases prices must be kept high in order to keep big pharma in business this means that while those with uncommon illnesses may benefit healthwise from the new measures their pocketbooks are in for a hit 
for example the cystic fibrosis drug kalydeco by vertex costs individual patients  
gileads sovaldi used to treat hepatitis c cashes in at  for a paltry week course of medication 
and soliris used to treat rare blood conditions costs the patient a whopping  per year 
the list of the  most expensive drugs that are currently manufactured are all created to treat orphan or uncommon illnesses 
thanks to these laws that allow big pharma to charge these insane amounts of money they can use those who suffer from rare diseases as their cash cows 
drugs for rare diseases will account for  of pharmaceutical branded drug profits by the year  newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",2016-10-28

950,this viral video has hillary running scared,"breaking fbi reopens investigation into clinton emails fbi looking into new developments after previously recommending no charges against democrat candidate image credits gage skidmore  flickr  
the fbi on friday announced it is reopening their investigation into hillary clintons private email server another shocking october surprise for the democrat candidate days from the presidential election 
in a letter to committees and lawmakers relevant to the matter fbi director james comey cited recent developments for the bureaus decision to look into new emails which may contain classified information and how they may relate to its previous investigation 
in previous congressional testimony i referred to the fact that the federal bureau of investigation fbi had completed its investigation of former secretary clintons personal email server due to recent developments i am writing to supplement my previous testimony comey wrote in the letter obtained by cnbc  
in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation 
although the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be signifcant and i cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony comey stated 
republican congressman jason chaffetz who led an oversight committee effort to pursue perjury charges against hillary  tweeted about the fbis announcement fbi dir just informed me the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation case reopened 
 jason chaffetz jasoninthehouse october   
back in july comey announced the fbis investigation into clintons use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state would not result in a recommendation to the justice department to pursue charges 
although the department of justice makes final decisions on matters like this we are expressing to justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case the fbi director stated in a speech at the time trump i have great respect that the fbi and department of justice have the courage to right their horrible mistake pictwittercomledngwvqa 
 washington examiner dcexaminer october   
speaking at a campaign rally in manchester new hampshire republican presidential candidate donald trump jumped on the bureaus decision to reopen its case 
the fbi has just sent a letter to congress informing them that they have discovered new emails pertaining to the former secretary of state hillary clintons investigation and they are reopening their case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the united states of america 
hillary clintons corruption is on a scale we have never seen before we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the oval office 
i have great respect for the fact that the fbi and the dept of justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made this was a grave miscarriage of justice that the american people fully understood and it is everybodys hope that it is about to be corrected

951,big pharma targets profits in rare diseases,"is deindustrialization a natural phenomenon of developed economies increasing real revenues affect peoples lifestyle choices jörg guido hülsmann  misesorg   
let me first state my position and then add a few arguments to back it up 
economic growth typically entails a reallocation of labor away from industrial production but it does not all by itself lead to falling industrial output the decline of industrial production in the us and france in the past thirty years is to some extent due to capital exports but especially to government interventionism in the form of mushrooming labor business and financial regulations education policies social security funding and taxation this decline cannot be stopped through more interventions even if they are designed with the good intention to reindustrialize the country 
now let me offer a few considerations in support of these contentions 
the reallocation of labor in a growing economy results most notably from capital accumulation and from changing preferences of the workingage population further investments and extensions of the existing structure of production make it necessary to spend more time devising new methods preparing industrial activity coordinating and monitoring supply chains lowquality bluecollar labor diminishes whereas there is some increase in highquality bluecollars but especially an increase in whitecollars working in and around the supply chains 
increasing real revenues affect peoples lifestyle choices rather than laboring long hours that provide essentially a monetary reward they increasingly prefer enjoyable activities that provide immediate psychological and emotional rewards thus the blossoming of artistic intellectual and scientific activities in developed countries at the expense of traditional industrial pursuits 
as a natural consequence of economic growth therefore industrial production declines relative to what it could be if it attracted even more people but this does neither imply a shrinking physical industrial output nor does it imply shrinking industrial revenues capital accumulation and technological progress make it possible that industry thrives even when less people have industrial employment germany provides an example 
in the past thirty years western capitalists have invested large amounts of capital in formerly communist countries of the east and far east this reallocation of capital though beneficial from the overall point of view of the world economy has been detrimental in the shortrun to the industrial development of those western countries where the capital would otherwise have been used 
but capital investments in countries such as france and the us have declined even more as a result of mushrooming government interventions welfare checks diminish the incentive to accept lowpaying and nongratifying industrial jobs massive subsidies for secondary and higher education artificially prolong schooling reduce the supply of qualified manual labor and create an artificial bias among the workingage population for scientific intellectual and artistic activities panoply of regulations have on the one hand increased the costs of doing business and on the other hand stimulated rentseeking and manifold forms of evasion and regulatory arbitrage today they are feeding entire armies of lawyers accountants auditors and financial advisors all at the expense of ordinary business 
these tendencies cannot be stopped through socalled reindustrialization policies which boil down to even more government spending premised on the spurious notion that irresponsible and often also inexperienced politicians know best how to use the available scarce resources such policies have utterly failed in the past airbus included and will fail in the future genuine reindustrialization requires more oxygen for industry it requires nothing less than a rollback of the artificial obstacles for industrial development that government interventions have created in past generations",2016-10-28

953,breaking fbi reopens investigation into clinton emails,"the email that got john podesta hacked latest wikileaks dump reveals phishing email that compromised podesta mikael thalen  october   comments 
the email that lead to the hack of clinton campaign chairman john podestas gmail account was published online friday by wikileaks 
the malicious march  email which claims to be from google asked podesta to change his password due to unauthorized access from an ip address in the ukraine 
clinton campaign staff members who viewed the email were convinced it was genuine clinton insider sara latham argued the gmail one is real while even clinton campaign it specialist charles delavan said this is a legitimate email 
the first suspicious aspect of the email unnoticed by the clinton camp was the bitly password reset link bitly a website that shortens long web addresses would not be found in an official email from google 
as first reported by motherboard earlier this month examination of the bitly link that redirected podesta to a fake google webpage also contained several red flags 
the bitly link helped hide not only the fact that the landing page ended in tk instead of com but that the web page itself failed to use https encryption such links were also likely used to fool googles spam filters 
prior analysis of the phishing link by cybersecurity group secureworks revealed the hackers also made a significant operation security mistake  they failed to make their two bitly accounts private 
the public accounts revealed the hackers had created  similar links to use against  gmail accounts between october  and may  
secureworks notes that the targets included individuals in russia and the former soviet states current and former military and government personnel in the us and europe individuals working in the defense and government supply chain and authors and journalists 
accounts linked to the  election were also in the hackers sights 
specific targets include staff working for or associated with hillary clintons presidential campaign and the democratic national committee dnc including individuals managing clintons communications travel campaign finances and advising her on policy 
thomas rid a professor at kings college displayed on twitter how decoding the phishing links could reveal the specific emails being targeted 
click to enlarge interestingly former secretary of state colin powell whose emails were released by the website dcleaks in september was also targeted by the same hackers 
click to enlarge this connection suggests the hackers who provided wikileaks with the podesta emails and dcleaks with the powell emails are likely one in the same the bitly accounts are also behind the malicious email sent to retired fourstar general philip mark breedlove  whose emails appeared on dcleaks in april 
numerous cybersecurity groups have accused the russian government of being responsible not only for the above election season hacks but for creating dcleaks and guccifer  to disseminate the data the us government also publicly blamed russia on october  just one week before the cia was tasked with preparing a possible retaliatory  cyber strike  
russian president vladimir putin has denied involvement arguing that the contents of the hacks are far more important than who is responsible 
listen does it even matter who hacked this data putin said on september  the important thing is the content that was given to the public 
putin again dismissed us hysteria concerning the hacks on thursday during an annual speech at the valdai discussion club in sochi 
hysteria has been whipped up in the united states about the influence of russia over the us presidential election he said its much simpler to distract people with socalled russian hackers spies and agents of influence does anyone really think that russia could influence the american peoples choice in any way is america a banana republic or what america is a great power newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",2016-10-28

955,clinton camp desperate russia trains for wwiii,"britain should embrace unilateral free trade right now unilateralism is not simply a utopian libertarian ideal louis rouanet  misesorg   image credits iker merodio  flickr  
if we read the newspapers or listen to the experts britain faces two ways to negotiate its way out of the european union without succumbing to the protectionists sirens 
the first is a deal à la norway not only with full access to the common market but also with full implementation of eu law and a contribution to the eu budget as is the case for every member state the second option would be a trade treaty such as the one negotiated between the eu and canada however a viable third opportunity exists unilateral freetrade 
contrary to what is often assumed unilateralism is not simply a utopian libertarian ideal which cannot be reached in todays world unilateral free trade is genuine freetrade it is also the most pragmatic and efficient strategy to foster commerce and peace theresa may seems ready to conduct an interventionist industrial and economic policy which oddly resembles french planning as it existed in the s and s but the freemarket policy paradigm is more likely to transform postbrexit britain into a flourishing economy 
unilateral free trade the british tradition 
the tradition of unilateral free trade is tightly linked to the uk with the victory of the liberals in the s britain became strongly committed to unilateral free trade and from  to at least  free trade was politically unassailable trade treaties however were seen as inherently suspicious sir robert peel when announcing the repeal of the corn laws in the house of commons in  brilliantly warned 
i trust the government  will not resume the policy which they and we have found most inconvenient namely the haggling with foreign countries about reciprocal concessions instead of taking that independent course which we believe to be conducive to our own interests  let us trust that our example with the proof of practical benefits we derive from it will at no remote period insure the adoption of the principles on which we have acted  let therefore our commerce be as free as our institutions let us proclaim commerce free and nation after nation will follow our example this repeal of the corn laws was the result of an intense political effort especially by cobden and the anticorn law league who made the case for unilateral free trade cobden in his later years explained 
we came to the conclusion that the less we attempted to persuade foreigners to adopt our trade principles the better for we discovered so much suspicion of the motives of england that it was lending an argument to the protectionists abroad to incite the popular feeling against the freetraders  to take away this pretense we avowed our total indifference whether other nations became freetraders or not but we should abolish protection for our own selves and leave other countries to take whatever course they liked best some will argue that the uk soon departed from unilateral free trade with the cobdenchevalier treaty of  which cobden himself supported and negotiated it is less known however that this treaty was primarily a way to avoid conflict after orsinis attempt to murder napoléon iii in  the emperor was convinced by this same orsini to support the cause of italian independence this italian question brought england to the edge of war with france being strongly antimilitarists both cobden and chevalier looked at a trade treaty not primarily as a way to adopt free trade but as a way to establish friendship between france and england gladstone himself an ardent unilateralist in retrospect held that there were only two alternatives one of them the french treaty  the other war with france and cobden felt that the treaty was gods own method to produce an entente cordiale 
commercially the treaty was an incredible success mainly because it was not supervised by bureaucrats  as is the case today with trade treaties  but by two prominent free traders as cobden was aware of all the dangers for real free trade contained in the negotiations of trade treaties he proceeded very carefully cobden wrote in a letter to the great british free trader john bright i will undertake that there is not a syllable on our side of the treaty that is inconsistent with the soundest principles of free trade nonetheless bright remained a skeptic and remarked 
governments seem as a rule to be standing conspiracies to rob and bamboozle people and why should that of louis napoleon be an exception the more i see of the rulers of the world the less of wisdom or greatness do i find necessary for the government of mankind to convince cobden of the benefits brought about by a treaty michel chevalier showed that the unilateral reductions of tariffs that bright asked for could constitute the british side of the bargain and could be extended to all other nations thus avoiding a clear violation of british unilateralism 
free trade with or without you 
the unilateral free trade program is very simple the british parliament declares the abolition of all tariffs to avoid a race in nontariff barriers the parliament can pass a law declaring that every product which conforms to the eu norms and regulations can be sold freely in the uk this should not be a problem since the uk still is a member of the eu by parliaments act most of the nontariff barrier problem withers away without any need for regulatory harmonization if the eu legislator considers it necessary to regulate the curvature of vegetables so be it but although eu producers will be free to sell their product in the uk the british legislator may deem it unnecessary to regulate its producers in the same absurd way 
the advantages of this approach are many first the uk can have free trade now instead of waiting through years of negotiations no need to wait for bureaucrats to agree on which laws we burden consumers and producers with 
the comprehensive economic and trade agreement ceta for example between the eu and canada contrasts the expediency of unilateralism with endless negotiations negotiations about ceta were started in october  and finished in august  but for the treaty to be effective each eu member state still has to ratify it worse in some european federal member states the treaty must be agreed upon by the local federated states this is why wallonia recently vetoed ceta thus threatening the work of a sixyearlong negotiation in the case of the uk  and whether or not trade treaties are actually advancing free trade  the british economy cannot afford to wait that long for free trade 
the second major advantage of unilateralism is the message you send to brussels you are signifying to the eu apparatus that with or without you we will have free trade at this point the eu will have no leverage left with the uk the negotiation of a trade treaty on the other hand is a hopelessly utopian solution not only because of the obvious coordination problem between the  eu member states but also because the eu has a vested interest in making sure brexit fails eurocrats starting from the contestable assumption that the uk has much more to lose than the eu will try to concoct a deal as bad as possible for their fellow anglosaxon neighbors 
free trade first negotiations later 
still it is possible that after having declared free trade unilaterally the eu will decide to restrict the access of british corporations to the single market this is a particularly valid concern in the financial sector were banks and other financial institutions need licenses to operate in the eu member states the concern with unilateral free trade is that by respecting it it will remove any leverage the british government has to negotiate a favorable access to other actual and potential commercial partners without a treaty commercial partners it is thought will soon erect protectionist barriers 
unilateral free trade however does not mean the uk producers will be bullied without their government being able to respond first by declaring unilateral free trade the maintained strength of commercial links made will make it much easier to negotiate with the eu to antagonize a good client would be foolish lets not forget that this past decade british exports to the eu grew much slower than exports to the rest of the world at the same time the uk is a major consumer of eu products and its balance of commerce with the eu was negative by about  billion in  
but how can a country committed to unilateralism make sure other countries will not close their markets let us first remark that maintaining trade barriers to negotiate later with other nations is a selfdefeating strategy sir robert peel whom we mentioned earlier said in  that in the case of wine and brandy he did not reduce the duty because he hoped that they might employ these duties as instruments of negotiation with a view of effecting a reduction in the duties imposed by other countries on the produce of our own country such a strategy was selfdefeating tariffs in view of a negotiation by reducing the capacity of foreigners to produce for the british market were destroying the very interests that wanted free trade peel finally admitted in  during a debate in the house of commons i am bound to say that it is our interest to buy cheap whether other countries will buy cheap or no 
there certainly is a more efficient policy than maintaining trade barriers or threatening to raise some in order to force trade partners to keep their markets open indeed the british government can make it clear that if the eu unfairly penalizes british interests in some sectors eg finance then the british government will work to maintain the competitiveness of the industry in question by aggressively lowering their taxes imagine that the eu wants to damage britains car manufacturers then the british government should not be afraid to create a loophole and to lower manufacturers corporate taxes  even to zero in an economy which was never as globalized and competitive as today the uk would have good chances of prevailing over the eu interests 
perhaps the eu will consider making trading conditions with the uk harder but they would have way too much to lose if doing so means creating a fiscally ultraattractive market just next door in the short run unilateralism in trade can achieve what multilateralism cannot a quick and radical liberalization of exchanges in the long run unilateralism can achieve what multilateralism cannot genuine free trade",2016-10-28
956,the email that got john podesta hacked,"image credits flickr n  
the following excerpt is adapted from mendenhalls review of deirdre mccloskeys book bourgeois equality the original review which appeared in the quarterly journal of austrian economics is available here 
if its true that wayne booth inspired deirdre mccloskeys interest in the study of rhetoric then its also true  happily in my view  that mccloskey has refused to mimic booths programmatic formulaic methods and boorish insistence on prosaic succinctness bourgeois equality is mccloskeys third volume in a monumental trilogy that began with the bourgeois virtues  and bourgeois dignity  each published by the university of chicago press this latest volume is a big book alike in kind but not in theme to jacques barzuns from dawn to decadence  camille paglias sexual personae  or herald bermans law and revolution  and law and revolution ii  its meandering and personal blending scholarship with an essayistic style that recalls montaigne or emerson 
mccloskeys elastic arguments are shaped by informal narrative and enlivened by her plain and playful voice at times humorous rambling and deliberately erratic she gives the distinct impression that shes simply telling a story one that happens to validate a thesis shes having fun imagine phillip lopate articulating economic history mccloskey is in this regard a latterday edward gibbon adopting a mode and persona thats currently unfashionable among mainstream historians except that shes more lighthearted than gibbon and unashamedly optimistic 
mccloskeys elastic arguments are shaped by informal narrative and enlivened by her plain and playful voice at times humorous rambling and deliberately erratic she gives the distinct impression that shes simply telling a story one that happens to validate a thesis shes having fun imagine phillip lopate articulating economic history mccloskey is in this regard a latterday edward gibbon adopting a mode and persona thats currently unfashionable among mainstream historians except that shes more lighthearted than gibbon and unashamedly optimistic 
writing with an air of confidence mccloskey submits contra thomas piketty that ideas and ideology  not capital accumulation or material resources  have caused widespread economic development since  worldwide material wealth has increased and proliferated the quality of life in poor countries has risen  even if it remains unequal to that of more prosperous countries and the typical human being now enjoys access to the food goods services medicine and healthcare that in earlier centuries were available to only a select few in the richest parts of the globe the transition from poverty to wealth was occasioned by shifting rhetoric that reflected an emerging ethical consensus the rhetoricalethical change involved peoples attitudes toward other humans p xxiii namely the recognition of shared experience and sympathy as adam smith stated in the theory of moral sentiments attributing human progress to ideas enables mccloskey to advocate the norms and principles that facilitated economic growth and social improvement eg class mobility and fluidity while generating extensive prosperity thus her project is at once scholarly and tendentious a study of the conditions and principles that in turn she promotes 
she argues that commercialism flourished in the eighteenth century under the influence of ideas  such as human equality of liberty in law and of dignity and esteem p xxix  that were packaged in memorable rhetoric and aesthetics not matter mainly but ideas caused the great enrichment p  in other words the original and sustaining causes of the modern world  were ethical not material and they included the new and liberal economic idea of liberty for ordinary people and the new and democratic social idea of dignity for them p xxxi this thesis about liberty and dignity is clear and unmistakable if only because it is repetitive mccloskey has a habit of reminding readersin case you missed her point the first second or fiftyseventh time aroundthat the causes of the industrial revolution and the great enrichment were ideas not narrowly economic or political or legal changes p  she maintains to this end that the scottish enlightenment succeeded in combining the concepts of liberty and dignity into a desirable form of equalitynot equality of outcomes of course but of opportunity and treatment under the law and the scottish model to her mind stands in contradistinction to the french example of centralized topdown codification command planning and design 
a perennial villain lurks in the pages of her history the clerisy which is an appendage of the bourgeoisie p  and often dubbed the elite in regular parlance mccloskey calls the clerisy the sons of bourgeois fathers p xvii and neoaristocratic p  the clerisy includes those artists intellectuals journalists professionals and bureaucrats who resent the commercial and bettering bourgeoisie p xvi the clerisy seeks in different ways at different times to extinguish unfettered competition with exclusive illiberal irrevocable grants and privileges that are odious to free society and offensive to the rights of average consumers early on says mccloskey referring to the period in europe after the revolutionary year  the clerisy began to declare that ordinary people are misled in trading and so require expert protection and supervision p  the clerisy since then has been characterized by paternalism and a sense of superiority 
because the clerisy is shapeshifting assuming various forms from time to time and place to place its a tough concept to pin down the word clerisy does not appear in the books index to permit further scrutiny by contrast mccloskeys general arguments are easy to follow because the book is separated into parts with questions as their titles subparts consisting of onesentence headings answer those questions 
in a massive tour de force such as this readers are bound to take issue with certain interpretive claims historians will find mccloskeys summaries to be too breezy even libertarians will accuse her of overlooking manifest wrongs that occurred during the periods she surveys my complaints are few but severe for instance mccloskey is i believe either careless or mistaken to announce that during the nineteenth and early twentieth century under the influence of a version of science in a territory thats never specifically identified the right seized upon social darwinism and eugenics to devalue the liberty and dignity of ordinary people and to elevate the nations mission above the mere individual person recommending for example colonialism and compulsory sterilization and the cleansing power of war p xviii 
lets hope that its innocent negligence rather than willful distortion that underlies this odd unqualified categorical assertion adam cohens imbeciles  and thomas c leonards illiberal reformers  describe how in the united states social darwinism and eugenics were adopted primarily though not exclusively by the left not the right these recent books come on the heels of several scholarly treatments of this subject thomas m shapiros population control politics  philip r reillys the surgical solution  joel braslows mental ills and bodily cures  wendy klines building a better race  stefan kuhls the nazi connection  nancy ordovers american eugenics  christine rosens preaching eugenics  christina cogdells eugenic design  gregory michael dorrs segregations science  paul a lombardos edition a century of eugenics in america  and alexander minna sterns eugenic nation  these represent only a small sampling 
is mccloskey unware of these texts probably not she reviewed leonards book for reason although she did so after her own book reached press at any rate would she have us believe that emma goldman george bernard shaw eugene debs marie stopes margaret sanger john maynard keynes lester ward and w e b du bois were eugenicist agitators for the political right if so she should supply her definition of right since it would go against commonly accepted meanings on the matter of colonialism and war selfidentified members of the old right such as albert jay nock john flynn and senator robert taft advocated precisely the opposite of what mccloskey characterizes as right these men opposed among other things military interventionism and adventurism the trouble is that mccloskeys muddying of the signifiers left and right comes so early in the bookin the exordium that readers may lose trust in her question her credibility and begin to suspect the labels and arguments in her later chapters 
other undefined terms only make matters worse ensuring that mccloskey will alienate many academics who as a class are already inclined to reject her libertarian premises she throws around the term romanticism as if its referent were eminently clear and uncontested a conservative and romantic vision p xviii science fiction and horror fiction are  offshoots of romanticism p  jane austen is not a romantic novelist  because she does not take art as a model for life and does not elevate the artist to a lonely pinnacle of heroism or worship of the middle ages or adopt any of the other antibourgeois themes of novalis franz brentano sir walter scott and later romantics p  romanticism around  revived talk of hope and faith and a love for art or nature or the revolution as a necessary transcendent in peoples lives p  romantic candor p  the late eighteenthcentury romantic literary critics in england had no idea what john milton was on about sic because they had set aside the rigorously calvinist theology that structured his poetry p  the nationalist tradition of romantic writing of history p  romantic  hostilities to  democratic rhetoric p  in the eighteenth century  the idea of autonomy triumphed at any rate among the progressive clerisy and then became a leading romantic idea á la victor hugo p  and the romantic conservative thomas carlyle p  
to allege that the clerisy was thrilled by the romantic radicalism of books like mein kampf or what is to be done p xviii is also recklessly to associate the philosophies of say keats or coleridge or wordsworth with the exterminatory fantasies of hitler and lenin mccloskey might have guarded against this misleading conflation by distinguishing german idealism or contextualizing hegel or by being more vigilant with diction and definition her loose language will leave some experts i do not profess to be one scratching or shaking their heads and more problematic some nonexperts with misconceptions and misplaced targets of enmity one imagines the overeager and wellmeaning undergraduate having read bourgeois equality setting out to demonize william blake or destroy the reputation of percy shelly about whom paul cantor has written judiciously wouldnt originality imagination creativity and individualismwidely accepted markers of romanticismappeal to mccloskey yet her unconditionally derogatory treatment of romanticismwhich she portrays as a fixed monolithic selfevident thingundermines aspects of that fluctuating movement period style culture and attitude that are or seem to be consistent with her weltanschauung 
but i protest too much these complaints should not diminish what mccloskey has accomplished would that we had more grand studies that mapped ideas and traced influences across cultures communities and eras mccloskey takes the long view as we all should her focus on rhetoric is crucial to the future of liberty if given the technological advances we have made the work we do will be more and more about decisions and persuading others to agree changing minds and less and less about implementation by hand p  equally significant is her embrace of humanomicsdefined as the story of a complete human being with her ethics and language and upbringing p xxwhich materializes in casual references to henrik ibsens plays challenges to the depiction of john milton as a lonely poet in a garret writing merely to the starry heavens p  analyses of jane austens novels and portrayals of elizabethan england her historical and narrative arc enables us to contextualize our own moment with all of its troubles and possibilities 
best of all her book is inspiring and exhilarating and brimming with rousing imperatives and moving calls to action let us then she says at one point not reject the blessings of economic growth on account of planning or pessimism the busybody if wellintentioned rationalism of some voices of the french enlightenment or the adolescent if charming doubts of some voices of the german romantic movement fashionable though both attitudes have long been among the clerisy as rational optimists let us celebrate the great enrichment and the rhetorical changes in freer societies that caused it p  at another point she encourages her audience to guard against both cynicism and utopianism p  and elsewhere to heed tradetested cooperation competition and conservation in the right mix p  these little nudges lend her credibility insofar as they reveal her true colors as it were and demonstrate that she is not attemptingas is the academic wontto hide her prejudices and conceal her beliefs behind pretended objectivities 
poverty is relative and hence permanent and ineradicable despite mccloskeys claim that we can end poverty p  if tomorrow we woke up and the wealth of each living person were magically to multiply twentyfoldeven fiftyfoldthere would still be people at the bottom the quality of life at the bottom however would be vastly improved the current manifestation of global poverty shows how far we as a species have advanced in the last few centuries mccloskey is right we should pursue the ideas that accelerated and achieved human flourishing that demonstrably brought people out of distress and destitution hard sciences and mathematical models are insufficient in themselves to convey the magnitude and splendor of these ideas and their accomplishments hence we should welcome and produce more books like mccloskeys that undertake a rhetoricalethical revaluation to both examine and celebrate a society of open inquiry one which not only depends on rhetoric in its politics and in its science and in its economy but which also yields intellectual creativity and political freedom p  in mccloskeys approach economics and the humanities are not mutually exclusive rather they are mutually illuminating and in fact indispensably and inextricably tied an economics that forsakes the dignity of the human person and his capacity for creativity and aesthetics does so at its own peril and to its own disgrace all economics is at its core humanomics we could do without the latter term if we understood the former newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",2016-10-28

the very first thing to note is that comey made no mention of a grand jury the emails whose existence he learned of may have been the result of a subpoena in another investigation if that is the case further subpoenas are quite possible a tool that was left unused in the investigation to date

962,competing theories on why the fbi reopened the hillary email server investigation,"eight ways to strengthen our democracy beyond voting the strength of our civic life depends on what we do outside elections by chuck collins   chuck collins 
throughout this trying election season weve been told how much is at stake with our vote but the success of any democracy depends on continuing to pay attention long after we cast our ballots 
so lets pledge to strengthen our democracy with a few resolutions to focus our intentions and keep us moving forward over the next four years 
 change your media diet  
way too much ink airtime and mental real estate has been consumed by the horserace reporting on electionsits all about whos winning and losing so unplug from the talk shows that interview pollsters and engage in partisan bickering all day find the commentators and independent media outlets that strengthen our civic life 
 turn off corporate media 
this election has been very profitable for big media corporations but bad for our democracy as cbs chairman les moonves remarked  man who would have expected the ride were all having right now the moneys rolling in and this is fun 
our differences have been compounded by media reports that amplify the loudest and most partisan utterances election coverage this year has encouraged us to view one another as cartoon caricatures not neighbors 
 reject the consumer mentality in elections  
were encouraged to view national elections like consumers buying a car but presidential elections can make most of us feel like spectators not participants election day is a small part of our real democracythink of voting as a tiny fraction of your civic life 
 make your voice heard  
pledge to communicate with your elected officials all year round not just when they want your vote call write email and attend community forums when a politician hears from a dozen constituents with the same concern it matters 
a few resolutions must address our polarized political atmosphere the only way to break through this is by connecting with people we dont always agree with 
for instance the liberal california sociologist arlie hochschild spent five years interviewing conservative tea party activists in louisiana making friends and asking deep questions she urges us all to scale the empathy wall and learn each others stories 
heres a few easy ways to get started 
try a social media fast 
social media is amazing but it mostly serves as an echo chamber to reinforce our existing views its not a substitute for talking to people asking questions and learning why people support certain policies 
 practice the art of civil discourse  
find ways to meet others facetoface to engage in conversations not soapbox speeches and debates look at the  living room conversation  movement that brings people together across political divisions their goal is to encourage authentic respectful conversations to strengthen relationships and advance understanding of the challenges opportunities and solutions before us 
finally other resolutions should focus on changing our polarizing election system 
 eliminate the wealth primary  
long before voters cast their ballots in a primary big money donors have winnowed the field and selected who will stand for election people all across the political spectrum agree that we need fundamental campaign finance reform to reduce the influence of big money including the repeal of citizens united  
 break the twoparty duopoly  
a growing number of voters have declared independence from the two major parties so why do we allow other voices and perspectives to be excluded from presidential debates our democracy would benefit if we had real choices outside the two major parties as they do in most other countries in the world 
the strength of our civic life depends on what we do outside elections and especially after the deeply toxic experience of  we all need to step up to protect our real democracy from those who profit from division

while hillary likes to pump us full of crap claiming that lawabiding americans wouldnt be targeted with her tyranny her broad and evasive gun control measures would directly affect americans with no criminal records while having zero impact on the behavior of violent criminals 
one example is hillary calling for the reinstatement of the national assault weapons ban and a prohibition on highcapacity magazines however the result of her assault weapons ban would essentially take up a massive category of firearms including the popular ar while making high capacity magazines illegal to even possess 
we all know these types of regulations are completely ineffective in preventing gun violence since criminals have no regard for laws in the first place and are obviously not going to turn over their guns just because hillary decides to pass a law 
her other constitutionsubverting plan is to pass a law making it legal for victims of gun violence to sue gun manufacturers which would quickly bankrupt these companies however hillarys ultimate goal is to ban all guns in america completely by utilizing the supreme court with her handpicked justice filling antonin scalias vacancy she would have the scotus revisit the district of columbia v heller  ruling if successful the court would eliminate its previous affirmation that it is an individuals constitutional right to keep and bear arms 
when you put all the pieces together hillarys plans for america is nothing short of chilling history taught us the brutal lesson about what happens when a populace is unarmed  images of corpses from nazi concentration camps come to mind add hillarys gungrabbing plan to her dream of turning america into a borderless society and flooding our country with muslim refugees and you have the perfect recipe for disaster 
god help us if this woman is elected continue to share stories like this and tirelessly work to expose this woman before election day once shes in office the america that we know and love will be drastically transformed into a thirdworld country crap hole and hillarys lifelong plans will be complete",2016-10-29

breathing  a process that goes almost unnoticed and happens on such a deep subconscious level yet it is vital for our being nowadays there are more and more cases of people breathing incorrectly 
living in a big city surrounded by constant stress pollution and technology can sometimes bring the body out of sync with the natures flow young children know how to breathe correctly on an intuitive level their body follows the rhythm of nature 
with time as the stress increases and obstacles come into our lives we quickly forget our calm manner of breathing and switch to a frantic one instead without even realizing it cancer prevention 
in  dr otto warburg received a nobel prize when he proved that cancer cells are anaerobic  this means that they cannot survive in high levels of oxygen when a body is low on oxygen some cells start to replace it by fermenting sugar a normal cell gets its energy through a process of respiration of oxygen whereas a cancer cell does it through fermentation cardiovascular health 
hypertension is all too common quite often as a result of stress in order to lower the blood pressure its important to decrease the stress levels  one of the oldest and most natural ways to do that is through deep slow breathing not only does it calm your heart beat but it allows the blood to flow at a more even pace 
research was conducted over a  year period that showed how proper breathing can prolong the lifespan  as well as increase general health the framingham study found a correlation between the vital capacity meaning the largest amount of air that can be expelled from the lungs after a deep breath and the lifespan of that person an increased vital capacity means a potentially longer lifespan cure for depression 
brain needs oxygen to work just like any other organ in the body stroke has a tendency to leave the body paralyzed as a result one of the causes is the lack of oxygen supply to the brain during a stroke this is an extreme example but looking on a smaller scale there is a connection between improper breathing and depression long periods of even a slightly limited air supply to the body caused by improper breathing can lead to a decrease in cognitive functions symptoms such brain fog forgetfulness lack of concentration and in the end depression are all interconnected increased energy levels 
have you ever told someone youre tired and in return you were told to go for a walk or do a light exercise this is because the body converts oxygen into energy through a process called cellular respiration  when you inhale the air correctly more of it gets to your body thus increasing the energy levels through conversion it is also one of the reasons why people who exercise on a regular basis are generally more energetic than those with sedentary lifestyles different breathing techniques 
there is a countless number of breathing techniques for different purposes and each one of them has its own benefits breathing exercises can lower or raise blood pressure improve sleep help with anxiety and much more 
yoga is one of the practices that incorporates breathing exercises called pranayama as an essential part of the process coming from the east its uncertain when exactly yoga originated but there is evidence that it has been around for at least  years  yogic breathing techniques have been applied for thousands of years making them timeproof i will share with you a couple of my favorite breathing techniques that i personally use in different situations best body detoxifier 
kapalbhati is a breathing technique that detoxifies your body opens up your nasal passages and allows your mind to concentrate after doing the exercise you will feel a rush of energy that will immediately wake you up 
instructions sit comfortably with a straight spine place your left hand on the knee with the palm facing upwards and your right hand on the stomach take a deep breath quickly exhale while exhaling pull the stomach in as if youre trying to touch the back and do it to an extent that feels comfortable however do not apply strength or pressure beyond the level of comfort  repetitions per set come back to normal breathing after each set and observe your bodys sensations its advised to do  repetitions daily sleeping and stress reducing technique 
its a simple slow breathing  exercise that helps you fall asleep faster or calm down during an anxiety attack all you have to do is fully exhale through your mouth with a sound whoosh with a closed mouth slowly inhale with your nose on a count of four hold your breath for seven seconds exhale fully through your mouth on a count of eight  making a whoosh sound repeat until you feel sleepy or calm",2016-11-09

981,une fan demande le remboursement de son tatouage après avoir appris la séparation des frero delavega  le gorafi,"keywords cardiovascular  diabetes  dietary fat  heart disease  sugar  sugar industry 
sugar does not have a unique role in heart disease when it comes to dietary claims made by the sugar industry we need to take them with a grain of salt 
researchers at the university of california san francisco have uncovered documents and communications dating back as far as the s revealing that the srf sugar research foundation now known as the sugar association funded research to serve its own interest to create a sweet image of sugar 
at the time heart disease was on the rise as was the consumption of dietary fat and sugar instead of trying to determine the true cause for the higher occurrence of the disease the biased research focused everyones attention on fat 
ucsfs finding published in jama internal medicine shows researchers at leading universities including harvard were paid by the srf in an effort to portray dietary fat as the major cause of heart disease in the process sugars role in the fatal disease has been ignored singing the praises of lowfat foods 
as a result of the biased research published in many esteemed publications life in the second half of the th century was filled with misleading dietary recommendations and scary headlines 
warnings regarding the dangers of dietary fat ran rampant eating fat especially the saturated variety was equivalent to clogging your arteries even eating an egg containing  grams of the forbidden macronutrient was considered a luxury not to be indulged in more than once per week 
lowfat diets became the craze in fact lowfat labels decorated food packaging throughout groceries stores from yoghurt aisles to frozen sections consumers felt good whenever they chose lowfat varieties over standard options 
yet this sense of wellbeing generated by the lowfat fad was unfounded to add flavour to lowfat foods sugar was the usual substitute and the truth that has been uncovered is that sugar is a secret killer it contributes not only to obesity and diabetes but also to the leading cause of death worldwide cardiovascular disease cvd a time for change 
recently the sugar industrys funded research has been challenged by unbiased studies which reveal sugar to possess the unwelcome property previously and falsely attributed to fat it leads to atherosclerosis 
jama internal medicine has published a study by a team of ucsf researchers showing that sugar aside from causing diabetes and tooth decay sets into motion several changes that bring on heart disease in this study the diets of  children were changed to replace added sugar with starch while maintaining the same amounts of protein fat complex carbohydrates and total caloric intake the results showed beneficial effects on ldl cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well as diastolic blood pressure 
another study undertaken by researchers from saint lukes mid america heart institute and albert einstein college of medicine and published in progress in cardiovascular diseases showed that consuming diets high in added sugar caused an increase in ldl bad cholesterol total cholesterol and triglycerides while lowering hdl good cholesterol 
the new research results have brought about a change in worldwide dietary guidelines from governmental associations to medical organisations and private practitioners are warning consumers and patients about sugars toxicity 
the us dietary guidelines for  to  recommend that added sugars make up less than  percent of a persons daily calorie consumption while the main reason for this recommendation is that added sugar constitutes empty calories and leads to a nutrientdeficient diet the guidelines also acknowledge that there is strong evidencelower intake of sources of added sugars are associated with reduced risk of cvd in adults 
the american heart association warns that too much added sugar in your diet could significantly increase your risk of dying from cardiovascular disease it recommends lowering dietary sugar intake even further to a maximum of  teaspoons and  teaspoons for women and men respectively how can something sweet be so bad 
according to one cardiologist dr stephen sinatra sugar delivers its damage to the cardiovascular system via a surge in insulin high levels of insulin wreak havoc on blood vessels endothelial linings an inflammatory response ensues causing the walls of the blood vessels to become clogged in this way the stage is set for heart disease 
add to that the wellknown fact that sugar leads to diabetes which raises the risk of heart disease and the overall danger is compounded addictive properties exacerbate the problem 
it seems that the sugar industry pushed us toward a secret killer just like the tobacco industry did this notion seems even more valid in light of medical claims that sugar like nicotine is an addictive substance 
in medical circles addiction is an altered state of the brain which causes repetitive behaviour despite negative consequences experts state that studies on rats prove sugar to be more addictive than cocaine 
when our bodies digest sugar they release dopamine and opioids these neurotransmitters play a key role in the brains reward centre which in turn causes addiction to the same substance that set off too much activity in this pleasure circuit so what do we do now 
we need to gather public funding to carry out unbiased research on consumer goods including foods 
food labels should allow consumers to identify easily how much added sugar is present in every food item 
every processed food item should not be allowed to contain more than  percent of its total calories from added sugars 
widespread education regarding sugars toxicity should reach from the classroom to our doctors offices 
everyone deserves the chance to break the cycle of sugar addiction

food waste and hunger are enormous global environmental and public health problems as overwhelming as these issues are community groups volunteers local businesses and organizations are working on trying to find a solution 
what started as a social action project in  a few members of a small community in metroatlanta georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste 
and theyre succeeding 
the project grew into a nonprofit organization with a team of more than  volunteer drivers a network of more than  donors and frontline agencies who feed the hungry on a daily basis 
amazingly the entire group has rescued more than  million pounds of food  enough to provide  million meals heres more of this motivating againstallodds story food waste and hunger 
about a third of the planets food goes to waste thats enough to feed two billion people 
the united nations environment programme unep and the world resources institute wri report that about onethird of all food produced worldwide  worth around  trillion  are lost or wasted in food production and consumption systems 
furthermore the natural resources defense council nrdc cites the following 
forty percent of the food in the united states is never eaten but at the same time one in eight americans struggles to put enough food on the table 
nearly  million people worldwide suffer from hunger  but according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations we squander enough food  globally  trillion pounds a year  to feed every one of them more than twice over 
in developing nations much of the food is lost after harvest because of the lack of refrigeration good roads and adequate storage facilities on the other hand developed nations waste more food when retailers order display or serve too much 
additionally consumers waste food when they ignore leftovers in the back of their refrigerators  or toss perishable food out before it expires more alarming statistics of wasted food 
much of the wasted food in the us ends up in landfills the us environmental protection agency epa reports that food waste is the second largest category of municipal solid waste sent to landfills in the united states 
and it accounts for about  percent of the waste stream thats more than  million tons of food waste that the us sends to the landfills each year 
additionally according to nrdc on average people dining out leave  percent of meals uneaten and  percent of these potential leftovers are not taken home 
in spite of the dismal statistics on food waste  and the struggles and pain hungry people endure  community groups organizations local businesses and volunteers in metroatlanta georgia are making headway in not wasting food and feeding people in need people are fed perishable food not wasted 
more than ten years ago a few members of a community in metroatlanta georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste they wanted to take leftover fresh food from grocery stores and restaurants and quickly deliver it to agencies that provide food to families and individuals in need 
since the first delivery was made in  the group has rescued more than  million pounds of food and the group believes this figure equals enough to provide more than  million meals 
as success mounted in eliminating food waste and feeding people in their community the group established itself as a nonprofit organization called second helpings atlanta  now second helpings atlanta has  donors  partner agencies and a team of more than  volunteer drivers who pick up and drop off perishable food every day 
executive director joe labriola says the challenge is getting the food from those who have it to those who need it and thats what we do we play a very specific role we do  scheduled pickups and deliveries a week weve gotten pretty good at this fresh food versus nonperishable 
fresh food provides more nutrition than the nonperishable processed diet that so many people eat  especially people with low or no income one of second helpings atlantas goals is to change that standard offering fresh food that will ideally help prompt healthier eating habits 
this year the group has delivered  pounds of food and labriola estimates they will pick up and deliver more than  million pounds by the end of the year 
the reason were so focused on perishable food is that were providing nutrition to the diets of people who are surviving on processed food were breaking the cycle and hope that some of the health benefits of fresh food will start to kick in 
according to labriola he sees no reason why this type of food waste program cant easily be adopted anywhere he adds that  percent of the food produced in the us is never consumed and the average annual cost per household of food that is thrown out is  
twenty percent of people in georgia live in a foodinsecure environment  meaning theyre not sure when theyre going to eat next its a pretty grim story labriola says but if we rescue just  percent of that food we can feed  million americans how its working 
when people sign up to volunteer theyre shown the available routes then theyre asked to choose the route that would work best with their location and schedule 
most pickups are regularly scheduled however the group often gets calls from people holding weddings bar mitzvahs or festivals  knowing there will be leftover food at the end of the night then a call goes out to find a volunteer to help pickup and delivery the leftover food 
volunteer drivers make food deliveries every day of the year except christmas food pickups range in size  so people can pick them up no matter if they own a small sedan or a minivan that way volunteering is within the reach of everyone 
from the time a driver leaves home  stopping to pick up the food and drop it off at a partner agency  it usually takes no longer than  minutes for he or she to return home families volunteer 
quite often entire families will volunteer and work together for the weekly delivery service labriola says families volunteering are instrumental to educating younger generations about hunger and food waste 
for example around thanksgiving a family with two young children met labriola one day to pick up dozens of turkeys at a grocery store the children looked amazed as they helped carry the delivery  birdbybird  from the store to the truck and into the agency that would distribute them to families labriola told the kids they just helped feed  families the children soon realized what they did one of the children said thats as many kids that are in my school 
the exemplary work and dedication exhibited by volunteers in the metroatlanta georgia community is a truly successful model of how to eliminate food waste and hunger perhaps more community groups organizations local businesses and volunteers will consider following their worthy example you might also like",2016-11-21

keywords fallout  nuclear  nuclear attack  nuclear attack survival  nuclear bomb  nuclear bomb survival  nuclear power  nuclear radiation  nuclear war  nuke  radiation  survival  tactical nuke with the ongoing tensions between the united states and russia fears of a nuclear world war  breaking out are running at an alltime high 
with that in mind i thought it needful to write an article on how to survive the aftermath of a nuclear fallout obviously we could discuss the likelihood of such an event occurring but that isnt within the scope of this article personally i believe that at this point in time such a scenario is not at all far fetched however the situation is very fluid and thus things could change at any time 
basically theres two main types of nuclear weapons out there first youve got what is known as the tactical nukes and then the intercontinental sort  the stuff that would basically flatten the earth in that case theres no point even trying to survive that im going to be talking about how to survive a tactical nuke incident  dont be anywhere near ground zero 
obviously the first step to surviving the initial explosion is to not be there in the first place of course theres not a ton that you can do if you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time youve just got to hope that you exit this world pretty quick  which would most certainly happen if youre anywhere close to ground zero 
the tremendous heat and sheer force of the explosion is enough to kill anyone and flatten anything within an  km radius of the detonation site the intense thermal radiation emitted by the flash of light at detonation is enough to blind you burn your flesh and start fires in the impact zone 
if youre outside when this happens and you happen to survive you should take immediate cover in a building if you get any debris on you you should wash it off with soap and water as soon as possible 
as a survivor of the initial explosion you now have around  to  minutes to bail out of the area before a lethal amount of radiation fallout comes down from the mushroom cloud in those  minutes you need to get at least  km  mile from the blast zone to survive the fallout however within  hours lethal radiation will spread with prevailing winds so keep moving to safety you should feel for the wind and begin running perpendicular to it  not upwind or downwind  getting to shelter 
if you cant get out of ground zero for whatever reason then you need to get to shelter as soon as possible get into the deepest underground basement that you can find or the highest story above the th level if possible 
if you are in the fallout zone but safely sheltered you need to remain there for at least  days during this time food and water should be carefully rationed and clothing layered up to prevent radiation 
really the best way to survive a nuclear event is to prepare for one 
remember the nuclear fallout shelters of the cold war era well thats what you need to be inside to survive but not just any shelter its got to meet a number of different specifications which i am not going to go into because you can find plenty of information on that if you google how to build a nuclear fallout shelter etc  personal protection measures 
protecting your body from harmful radiation and fallout particles is your number one priority after getting to shelter 
like i said before being prepared prior to such an event is very important which is why its a good idea to carry the gear im going to talk about shortly inside a go bag that you can keep in your car house or workplace 
some quick first aid tips it is necessary that all wounds should be covered to prevent contamination and the entry of radioactive particles any burns caused by radiation must first be washed and then normal burn first aid procedure should be followed 
now lets look at the gear you should have ready before a nuclear attack happens 
gas mask youll need a gas mask to protect your face and respiratory system from airborne pathogens and chemical particles israeli military surplus m gas masks fitted with nato  mm cbrn filters are some of the best and cheapest around yet are getting harder and harder to find these days with huge supplies flying off the shelves in the relatively recent ebola scar i have the m civilian version of this gas mask and its extremely comfortable has a port for a hydration tube and best of all its been tested in real life conditions in the middle east 
military chemical suit these suits provide optimal protection from chemical and biological attacks and are used by the british army these are surprisingly cheap yet are proven to work by soldiers whose lives depend on them in everyday combat situations you can get these for around  from amazoncom 
gloves youre going to need gloves to protect your hands from contact with chemical pathogens and biological particles long chemical resistant gloves can be found online at some supermarkets and hardware stores you can get these at around    depending on the brand etc 
boots in order to have full protection from chemical and biological hazards it is important to have a good pair of rubber overboots to protect your feet and legs from chemical and biological particles from coming into contact with your body ensure that you blouse your trousers inside your boots for maximum protection once again these boots that i recommend are used by the uk military and you can get them on amazoncom for around  
nuclear protection there is a way to reduce the effects of nuclear radiation in your body its called potassium iodide and its available on amazon for less than  for a pack of  tablets what this basically does is it reduces the chances of harmful radioactive iodine from entering your thyroid glands 
if you dont have any of these when a nuclear attack happens you can improvise as i mentioned before clothing should be layered up to prevent radiation contact with the skin cover your eyes with closefitting sunglasses or improvised goggles 
 decontaminating food and water 
water and food will be contaminated by debris from the nuclear fallout making procurement and consumption difficult however it is not impossible to make them safe to consume 
whenever possible try to use water that has been sealed in a container or bottle as you can safely assume that the water inside the sealed container is not contaminated wash the container thoroughly with soap and water or boil it for at least  minutes before breaking the seal if water in sealed containers is not available your next choice only under emergency conditions is water from springs again boil the water for at least  minutes before drinking keep the water covered while boiling to prevent contamination by airborne pathogens 
your last choice only in an extreme emergency where sealed water and spring water are unavailable is to use standing water that found in small pools ponds and basically any water that does not flow contaminants microorganisms and germs can survive easily in stagnant water first boil this water as long as practical to kill all organisms next filter it through a cloth to remove the nasties 
in all cases mentioned above use water purification tablets following all directions on the bottlepackaging after boiling and initial filtration prior to consumption 
like water you can also assume that sealed containers or packages of processed food are safe to ensure safety decontaminate all food containers by washing with soap and water or by boiling the container in water for  minutes this is where it helps to have a decent supply of sealed buckets and containers of militarystyle mres and freezedried foods such as wise foods and mountain house 
you should consider supplementing your sealed rations with local plants animals and produce only in extreme emergencies unfortunately no matter what you do to prepare or decontaminate the food there is no guarantee that cooking will kill all the biological agents 
remember you can survive for a long time without food at least  weeks but can be longer especially if the food you eat may potentially kill you 
if you must use local food select only healthylooking plants animals fruit and vegetables do not select known carriers of organisms such as rats or other vermin always use gloves and protective clothing when handling and dressing animals plants etc cook all plant and animal food by boiling only boil all food for at least  minutes to kill all pathogens do not try to fry bake or roast local food as there is no guarantee that all infected portions have reached the required temperature to kill all pathogens do not eat raw food at all costs 
obviously this article is nowhere near comprehensive but i hope it gives you some idea of what you need to do in order to survive the aftermath of a nuclear attack we can only hope and pray that such an event does not happen and that peace will prevail on this planet you might also like",2016-11-22

the himalayan salt lamps are made from natural himalayan crystal salt rock formed millions of years ago in the foothills of himalaya salt lamps are blocks of pure himalayan salt so they come from the same region of the world also known as the vitamins of the air they are made from the salt that came from ancient oceans and serve as a perfect air ionizer how himalayan salt lamps work 
himalayan salt lamps emit negative ions in the air which are healthy for the human body the ionization is supported by the bulb inside of the salt block since the bulb heats the salt block around it himalayan salt attracts the water around it and this process called as hygroscopic therefore the himalayan salt lamps may become dump or wet especially in an environment with high humidity as the bulb heats the salt lamp the water evaporates and the negative ions are released in the air the negative ions bind with the positive harmful ions such as allergens molds and bacteria and neutralize the environment in the house improve blood flow 
particular studies have suggested that negative ions such as those emitted by himalayan salt lamps can accelerate blood flow this boost helps to improve several disorders of the vascular system and can prevent certain damage to the lungs purify air 
dust pollen cigarette smoke and other pollutants ruin the purity of the air we breathe and the perfect way to neutralize it is to use himalayan salt lamp on your room it acts as air purifier through its ability to absorb water and evaporating them after they attract water molecules in the air which traps impurities in the air and leaves you with fresh clean air this is known as hygroscopy good vibrations 
salt has been used through out the ages to clean energies from homes and people you can use salt to clear crystals clear your body and clear your home because salt crystals vibrate at a frequency closer to the earths magnetic frequency known as the shuman resonance frequency they can also help bring us back in balance boost energy levels 
positive ions deplete the body of energy and it is believed that himalayan salt lamps can actually do the opposite the negative ions increase energy levels which yields a refreshing effect similar to the feeling of rejuvenation achieved from spending time in nature improve your breathing 
asthma and other breathing complications can be triggered by polluted corrupted air salt lamps ensure that you breathe cleaner air whenever you are around them helping to improve breathing and prevent contaminants from entering your lungs other benefits of using himalayan salt lamp

posted friday october   at am edt 
when i was a kid if i were told that id be writing a book about diet and nutrition when i was older i wouldve thought that whoever told me that was out of their mind 
living in newark new jersey my parents and i consumed anything and everything that had a face or a mother except for dead rotting pig bodies although we did eat bacon as if all the other decomposing flesh bodies were somehow miraculously clean going through high school and college it was no different in fact my dietary change did not come until i was in my s 
just to put things in perspective after i graduated from weequahic high school and before going to seton hall university i had a parttime job working for a butcher i was the delivery guy and occasionally had to go to the slaughterhouse to pick up products for the store needless to say i had no consciousness nor awareness as change never came then despite the horrors i witnessed on an almost daily basis 
after graduating with a degree in accounting from seton hall i eventually got married and moved to a town called livingston livingston was basically a yuppie community where everyone was judged by the neighborhood they lived in and their income to say it was a plastic community would be an understatement 
livingston and the shallowness finally got to me i told my wife i was fed up and wanted to move she made it clear she had to be near her friends and new york city i finally got my act together and split for colorado 
i was living with a lady in aspen at the end of  when one day she said  lets become vegetarians i have no idea what possessed me to say it but i said okay 
at that point i went to the freezer and took out about  worth of frozen dead body parts and gave them to a welfare mother who lived behind us 
well everything was great for about a week or so and then the chick split with another guy 
so here i was a vegetarian for a couple weeks not really knowing what to do how to cook or basically how to prepare anything for about a month i was getting by on carrot sticks celery sticks and yogurt fortunately when i went vegan in  it was a simple and natural progression anyway as i walked around aspen town i noticed a little vegetarian restaurant called the little kitchen 
let me back up just a little bit it was april of  the snow was melting and the runoff of ajax mountain filled the streets full of kneedeep mud now aspen was great to ski in but was a bummer to walk in when the snow was melting 
i was ready to call it quits and i needed a warmer place ill elaborate on that in a minute 
but right now back to the little kitchen knowing that i was going to leave aspen and basically a new vegetarian i needed help so i cruised into the restaurant and told them my plight and asked them if they would teach me how to cook i told them in return i would wash dishes and empty their trash they then asked me what i did for a living and i told them i was an accountant 
the owner said to me lets make a deal you do our tax return and well feed you as well so for the next couple of weeks i was doing their tax return washing their dishes emptying the trash eating three squares a day and learning as much as i could 
but like i said the mud was getting to me so i picked up a travel book written by a guy named foder the name of the book was hawaii looking through the book i noticed that in lahaina on maui there was a little vegetarian restaurant called mr naturals i decided right then and there that i would go to lahaina and work at mr naturals to make a long story short thats exactly what happened 
so im working at mr naturals and learning everything i can about my new dietary lifestyle  it was great every afternoon we would close for lunch at about  pm and go to the sheraton hotel in kaanapali and play volleyball while somebody stayed behind to prepare dinner 
since i was the new guy and didnt really know how to cook i never thought that i would be asked to stay behind to cook dinner well one afternoon thats exactly what happened it was my turn that posed a problem for me because i was at the point where i finally knew how to boil water 
i was desperate clueless and basically up the creek without a paddle fortunately there was a friend of mine sitting in the gazebo at the restaurant and i asked him if he knew how to cook he said the only thing he knew how to cook was enchiladas he said that his enchiladas were beanless and dairyless i told him that i had no idea what an enchilada was or what he was talking about but i needed him to show me because it was my turn to do the evening meal 
well the guys came back from playing volleyball and im asked what was for dinner i told them enchiladas the owner wasnt thrilled i told him that mine were beanless and dairyless when he tried the enchilada he said it was incredible being the humble guy that i was i smiled and said you expected anything less it apparently was so good that it was the only item on the menu that we served twice a week in fact after about a week we were selling five dozen every night we had them on the menu and people would walk around lahaina broadcasting enchiladas at naturals tonight i never had to cook anything else 
a year later the restaurant closed and somehow i gravitated to a little health food store in wailuku i never told anyone i was an accountant and basically relegated myself to being the truck driver 
the guys who were running the health food store had friends in similar businesses and farms on many of the islands i told them that if they could organize and form one company they could probably lock in the state thats when they found out i was an accountant and down to earth was born down to earth became the largest natural food store chain in the islands and i was their chief financial officer and comanager of their biggest store for  years 
in  i started to do a weekly radio show to try and expose people to a vegetarian diet and get them away from killing innocent creatures i still do that show today i pay for my own airtime and have no sponsors to not compromise my honesty one bit of a hassle was the fact that i was forced to get a masters degree in nutrition to shut up all the mds that would call in asking for my credentials 
my doing this radio show enabled me through endless research to see the corruption that existed within the big food industries the big pharmaceutical companies the biotech industries and the government agencies 
this information unconscionable as it is enabled me to realize how broken our health system is 
i left down to earth in  got nationally certified as a sports injury massage therapist and started traveling the world with a bunch of guys that were making a martial arts movie after doing that for about four years i finally made it back to honolulu and got a job as a massage therapist at the honolulu club one of hawaiis premier fitness clubs 
it was there i met the love of my life who i have been with since  she made me an offer i couldnt refuse she said if you want to be with me youve got to stop working on naked women so i went back into accounting and was the chief financial officer of a large construction company for many years 
going back to my newark days when i was an infant i had no idea what a chicken or egg or fish or pig or cow was my dietary blueprint was thrust upon me by my parents as theirs was thrust upon them by their parents it was by the grace of god that i was able to put things in their proper perspective and improve my health and elevate my consciousness 
the road that i started walking down in  has finally led me to the point of writing my book a sane diet for an insane world hopefully the information contained therein will be enlightening motivating and inspiring to encourage you to make different choices 
doing what we do out of conditioning is not always the best course to follow i am hoping that by the grace of the many friends and personalities i have encountered along my path you will have a better perspective of what road is the best road for you to travel on not only for your health but your consciousness as well

article will discuss how the program started how it has been developed and where it is going zika is not a threat to the babies of the world just to be absolutely clear from the beginning there is no solid evidence that zika is a threat to humanity it is a minimally dangerous viral infection which does not cause microcephalyin the almost  years since the zika virus was patented by the rockefeller foundation  no one ever noticed any association between zika infection of pregnant women and their babies being born with abnormally small heads or with defects in brain development but in  we were suddenly made aware of this supposed problem this claim based on nothing more than circumstantial evidence was the beginning point for the propaganda campaign a propaganda claim doesnt need to be true it just needs to be repeated over and over again until people believe it is trueafter half a year of fear and hysteria in the mainstream media even officials in brazil admit that zika is an unlikely cause of their microcephaly as reported in nature news  comment on july   an official from brazils ministry of health raises doubts to suggest zika is not the only factor in the reported microcephaly surge in his country the report stated zika virus has spread throughout brazil but extremely high rates of microcephaly have been reported only in the countrys northeast although evidence suggests that zika can cause microcephaly the clustering pattern hints that other environmental socioeconomic or biological factors could be at play we suspect that something more than zika virus is causing the high intensity and severity of cases says fatima marinho director of information and health analysis at brazils ministry of health if that turns out to be true it could change researchers assessment of the risk that zika poses to pregnant women and their children  despite this admission from brazil the zika propaganda campaign is moving ahead without interruption the campaign will not be stopped by contrary evidence about zika and microcephaly zika is a mild viral infection most people who get zika will be completely unaware of being infected for those who do get sick it is similar in many ways to having a cold or a mild case of the flu people experience fever rash joint pain and conjunctivitis the illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week infection is thought to provide lifelong immunity severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon deaths are rare the fact that almost no one dies from zika infection made it a very unlikely candidate for the development of a vaccine for those who actually feel sick from a zika infection they can receive comfort care and rest while their immune systems overcome the viral illness zika press releases set the stage for a propaganda campaign however if zika could be connected to some other horrible consequence such as microcephaly or paralysis guillainbarre syndrome for example then people would insist that we create a zika vaccine and would insist that every person on planet earth take it they would be willing to give up basic individual freedoms for the benefit of society which is always the goal of mind control programsin  a number of press releases and reports were released by the pan american health organization  world health organization pahowho and the cdc to set the stage for the unfolding of a grand mind control projectthe documents they published raised the red flag of alarm that a zika epidemic was unfolding throughout south america and mexico the conventional media got excited about the epidemic when they saw the word microcephaly the prospect of large numbers of babies being born with abnormally small heads and brains was a story that would really grab the attention of their audiencethe media used pictures of deformed babies to build fear in the hearts of people and to create the perception that we better watch out or zika is going to get us and our babies they worked really hard to instill public panic about zika in january and february of  in the timeline that follows you will see the word autochthonous public health agencies use the word autochthonous to say that an infection was locally generated an autochthonous case of zika is one that was acquired in the local area where a person lives this is in contrast with a zika infection that was acquired while visiting another region or countryi will list a few of the key points from some press releases to show how a foundation for the zika campaign was built and how momentum was established to project the campaign into mainstream media may  brazil confirms first autochthonous cases of zika  october  columbia confirms first autochthonous cases of zika  october  brazil reports unusually high number of babies with microcephaly  november  el salvador guatemala mexico paraguay suriname and venezuela report autochthonous zika infection  november   who calls upon member states to watch for the occurrence of microcephaly  december   pahowho issued the first of dozens of reports which chronicled the history of the growing zika epidemic and warned of microcephaly   december   who reports autochthonous zika infections in honduras  december   who reports autochthonous zika infections in panama  december   us cdc reports autochthonous zika infections in puerto rico and makes note of microcephaly in brazil  counting babies with microcephaly the mainstream media suddenly picked up on the zikamicrocephaly story in january of  and began sensationalizing it general concern was quickly transformed into alarm as officials in brazil reported a steady increase in the number of microcephaly cases as of january   they reported  cases of microcephaly andor central nervous system cns malformation suggestive of congenital infection they compared this with    data where there was an average of  microcephaly cases the brazil data about the babies was poor we didnt know their definition of microcephaly we didnt know how many of the mothers actually tested positive for zika we didnt know how the data was collected we also didnt know why there was a strong level of insistence that the only thing that could cause these birth defects was infection with the zika virus propaganda campaigns always dismissed other viewpoints other than the one being promoted they dont want an investigation of truth or a debate about the facts  they just want belief and submission the us propaganda machine goes public in january  cdc officials begin to ponder the situation first they say there might be an association between zika and microcephaly but they are far from asserting any kind of causative relationship good for them i thought when i heard that report but their apparent wisdom took a nosedive a minute later when the same cdc official went on to issue a travel warning to women to avoid traveling to brazil and other south american countries if they are pregnant think they might be pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant in the next couple yearswhat did the cdc just say there is no evidence of causation and we dont even know there is even a problem but women should stay home any way strange i thought as i began to remember how the conventional media the cdc and the who hyped up the african ebola epidemic in a similar kind of propaganda campaign just  months earlier the worldwide threat of ebola zaire completely died out long before a vaccine could be developed which must have been a major disappointment to big pharmabut this time they have a virus that is not going to die out this time their propaganda campaign will be much more sophisticated and it will make major steps toward the acceptance of universal mandatory vaccination for diseases such as zika a false international crisis involving deformed babies justifies action all through january and early february of  the news media provided us with a nonstop litany of stories about zika and deformed babies in a previous article i examined some of the headlines in the propaganda campaignthe cdc was still using the word possible association while the news media insisted on using the word cause despite the initial reserve of the cdc the news media began to shout the message across america zika is going to deform the heads of our babies while they are in the womb and theres no vaccine to protect usit seems like every zika story i saw included at least one photo of a baby with microcephaly and always stated that there is no vaccine yet we were reminded over and over again that zika is causing babies to be born with abnormally small heads mental retardation and blindness we were warned that some babies were dying at birth because of the severity of their brain deformation we were told that each baby born with microcephaly will cost ten million dollars or more in medical expenses during the childs life  these stories created ever increasing levels of apprehension and fear as they were intended to doas the mainstream media struggled to keep the fear level high and keep the story line flowing from week to week they began to focus in on government efforts to save us from zika it didnt take long for them to find people to interview who would ask the question they wanted asked what is the government going to do to protect our babies this question was asked over and over again even though there was no proof that zika infection and microcephaly were related the question was asked so many times by the media that no politician could dare to say i am not going to do anything because as far as we know zika doesnt cause microcephaly president obama responds to the question on february   president obama requested  billion dollars to study the situation and to develop a zika vaccine lets look at this more carefully we are going to spend  billion dollars to develop a vaccine for a virus that almost never kills anyone and has not been proven to cause birth defects  just to be safe or is something else going on hereperhaps the real story is that big pharma wants another cash cow vaccine and the zika threat has been promoted in such a way that people will insist that big pharma develop a zika vaccine for us suddenly big pharma companies will be able to put on their white hats and rescue all the babies of the world this would be such sweet deception if they could pull it off cdc declaration zika causes microcephaly the cdc announced in april of  that zika causes microcephaly this decision was based on a cdc analysis of available data they did not conduct comprehensive research they used a quacking duck kind of analysis if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck then it must be a duck they couldnt tell if it had feathers like a duck or has a bill like a duck but they still insisted on calling it a duck named zika in doing this they ignored some of the most important criteria in their analysiscdc researchers stated the seventh of shepards criterion proof in an experimental system that the agent acts in an unaltered state is aimed at medications or chemical exposures and does not apply to infectious agents thus given shepards criteria as a framework criteria   and  have been satisfied  evidence that is considered sufficient to identify an agent as a teratogen  in other words they used a set of seven criteria to determine whether zika could be considered to be a cause of microcephaly they determined that the association between zika infection and microcephaly was causative for  of the  criteria they suggested that additional study was needed before  of the other criteria could be met they excluded the seventh criteria altogether because it examined whether medications or chemicals might have caused microcephalyi couldnt believe that they excluded the seventh criteria when it is clear that microcephaly is known to be caused by pesticide exposure and could just as easily be caused by vaccinations during pregnancy as it was likely to be caused by zika infectionthese cdc scientists were only looking for causation from infectious agents nothing else seemed to matter this exclusionary mindset was present since the very beginning of the zika propaganda campaignthey ignored the effect of the tdap vaccine given to pregnant women in brazil in  they ignored the side effects of medications they ignored the consumption of gmo food glyphosate and pyriproxyfen that were widely used in brazil they ignored chemical exposure from brazils large chemical manufacturing facilities they ignored alcohol and drug use they ignored the effects of extreme multigenerational nutritional deficiencies and extreme poverty they ignored the introduction of genetically modified mosquitoes that were released in brazil they ignored exposure to rubella toxoplasmosis or cytomegalovirus they ignored the combined effects of all these factors as well as multigenerational modifications to the local gene pool from these potential causesi discussed these potential causes of microcephaly in my first article on zika published in january of there is one key point that i want to bring forward from the previous article concerning the number of babies born with microcephaly first we heard that there were some  cases of microcephaly in brazil after the initial shock and panic was produced we learned that further investigation showed that the number of confirmed cases was only the mainstream media also didnt mention that the number of babies born in the united states with microcephaly in a typical year is  when adjusting for population differences between the us and brazil we find that the rate of microcephaly in the us is actually  times higher than the rate in brazilin other words the us microcephaly incidence is much higher than brazil and our babies didnt get it from zika maybe our babies got it from the various potential causes i discussed in my previous articlei should also state that the researchers who put their names on this article are all employees of the cdc  i must question whether their analysis was truly objective and whether their findings were influenced by cdc ties to big pharma the zika vaccine is in the pipeline based on this single poor quality analysis its full speed ahead for developing a zika vaccine there are at least four companies plus the cdc working on a zika vaccine we are told that it will still take several years before a zika vaccine can be properly tested and made available in large quantities for the population of the worldzika vaccine trials have already begun and they are already recruiting volunteers in the us the us national institutes of health hopes to start phase ii trials of its vaccine in early   congress tries to protect our babies with zika funding now that the cdc has settled the zikamicrocephaly question it was time to get congress to fund the presidents request for a zika vaccine development program the house and the senate passed zika funding bills however they have different ideas of how much money should be spent and how the funds should be generated the funding process stalled at the end of june when the senate and house could not reconcile their differences congress went on a seven week summer vacation and wasnt available to try to resolve their differences this created a problem for the zika mind control campaign because it might mean there would be no new zika news to report during the summer keeping the propaganda campaign going by killing mosquitoes the mainstream media switched their focus from vaccine development to eradication of the aedes aegypti mosquito which is known to carry the zika virus if an infected mosquito bites a person then the person might develop the infection this is a fact that no one is disputing the great mosquito chase of  the cdc continues to count the number of zika cases in the us and puerto rico the numbers continue to rise through the spring and early summer they were looking for autochthonous cases of zika in the us but they could only find infected people who had traveled to zika infected countries or who had sex with people who traveled to those countriesfinally at the very end of july  people in the wynnewood section of miami florida were found to have zika even though they had not traveled to a zika infected country or had sex with a zika infected person public health officials at the state and federal level interpreted the presence of these cases to mean that zika must have been transmitted to these people by mosquito bites they ignored the possibility that the infected people might have been lying about their exposure for example having sexual contact with an infected person nevertheless officials concluded that they must implement a strong mosquito control program to prevent zika from spreading any furthernow that the zika epidemic was on us home soil the media had another fear inducing story to add to their propaganda campaign there are mosquitoes that are out to get you and our babies the governor of florida goes door to door to find more people with zika on august st the governor of florida contacted the us public health system and asked them to send a specially trained squad of federal public health agents to help with the zika emergency in miami these agents and florida officials went door to door in the wynwood neighborhood of miami and collected urine samples to identify additional cases of zika more cases were found but all were asymptomatic  the people didnt even know they were infected  problem  they cant find a zika infected mosquito  mosquitoes were tested for the presence of zika but all tests were negative officials dismiss the negative infection results by saying that finding a zika infected mosquito is like finding a needle in a haystack  aerial mosquito spraying program initiated the governor of florida in conjunction with federal public health agents decided that they needed to do aerial spraying of pesticide even though the aedes aegypti mosquito wouldnt travel more than  feet from its birth place in the wynwood neighborhood where the autochthonous zika cases were located the officials decided to spray a ten square mile area just to be safe a spraying program that covers ten square miles would make a sensational story in the media it would be much more alarming than a story about a neighborhood aerial spray zone it also would expose many more people to a toxic pesticide more about that laterthe first aerial spraying took place on august    toxic pesticide used in aerial spraying causes microcephaly officials told the public not to worry about the pesticide that was being sprayed because it naled is harmless they pointed to epa reports which supported their claim they didnt mention that naled was banned in europe in  they didnt mention that officials in puerto rico recently refused to allow the spraying of naled over their citizens they didnt mention that naled kills many other types of insects and aquatic creatures in addition to mosquitoes  most importantly official didnt mention that naled and the chemicals that are created when it breaks down in the environment have the potential for causing human birth defects  could pesticide naled cause microcephaly and other life threatening diseases officials didnt mention that the pesticide that they were spraying over the densely populated minority neighborhood of wynwood  was particularly dangerous for babies in the wombthis is what the journal of pesticide reform has to say about naled like all organophosphates naled dibrom is toxic to the nervous system symptoms of exposure include headaches nausea and diarrhea naled is more toxic when exposure occurs by breathing contaminated air than through other kinds of exposure in laboratory tests naled exposure caused increased aggressiveness and a deterioration of memory and learning naleds breakdown product dichlorvos another organophosphate insecticide interferes with prenatal brain development in laboratory animals exposure for just  days during pregnancy when the brain is growing quickly reduced brain size  percent dichlorvos also causes cancer according to the international agency for research on carcinogens in laboratory tests it caused leukemia and pancreatic cancer two independent studies have shown that children exposed to household nopest strips containing dichlorvos have a higher incidence of brain cancer than unexposed children  emphasis added naled exposure causes increased aggressiveness and a deterioration of memory and learning these are some of the symptoms that are also found in children on the autism spectrumone of the most toxic break down products in naled is dichlorvos this chemical caused a  reduction in brain size in pregnant lab animals after  days of exposure another word for reduced brain size is microcephalyso the pesticide they are spraying could increase the rate of autism among children in the spray zone and could cause microcephaly to occur in the babies of pregnant womenquestion if there are babies born in miami with microcephaly in the next nine months or if the autism rate in the spray zone increases will we blame zika or naled i am sure that no one from the cdc or from a public health agency will ever point a finger at naled they will use the children to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that zika is to blame naled is also harmful to adults dr naresh kumar a professor of public health at the university of miami commented about the risks of using pesticides in aerial spraying his statement came from cbs miami all are a neurotoxin meaning it will directly affect our nervous system it will affect not only the pregnant woman  it is also equally for children who have asthma and airway disease because when you are spraying in the air these aerosols stay in the air for at least five days  the miami herald provided this advice to people in the pesticide spray zone they stated the agency epa says the insecticide poses no risk for the majority of people but those sensitive to chemicals may want to stay inside during spraying close windows and turn off window air conditioners fruits and vegetables should also be washed before eating and outdoor furniture and grills covered  so if you are concerned about being exposed to the chemicals they are spraying then you should stay inside for  days until the pesticide falls out of the air you should keep your windows closed and turn off window air conditioners i wonder how many people were able to follow this advice in the subtropical urban climate of miami in augustmind control programs always try to make life difficult for those who live outside the box of normality they want us to follow their instructions which in this case would be to just not worry about the spraying if you are concerned then you can take their ridiculous suggestions which wont really protect you from the spray does zika also cause guillainbarre syndrome apparently the cdc suspects that zika causes the paralytic syndrome called guillainbarre if you look at the data collection forms for monitoring zika in the us you will see another masterful stroke of mind control in the making they are counting cases of guillainbarre syndrome on the same form with cases of zika why would the cdc try to make this connection the cdc indicates on their guillainbarre syndrome page that they are not sure what causes this syndrome they do mention that there were some cases of guillainbarre syndrome associated with the swine flu vaccine in  but otherwise the condition is rare with unknown etiology if they can make a case for the zika virus being the cause of guillainbarre syndrome then they will shift attention away from the fact that many vaccines and pesticides have a harmful effect on the human nervous system and are able to produce this type of paralysisi anticipate seeing a guillainbarre syndrome research paper just like the one produced by the cdc on microcephaly their new paper will just substitute the phrase guillainbarre syndrome for the word microcephaly they will show through statistical smoke and mirrors that the zika virus is causative for guillainbarre syndrome as well as microcephalyif they can pull this off then the zika virus will be blamed for all cases of vaccine damage in which microcephaly or paralysis results if they can pull this off and i suspect they will then pesticide manufacturers will also be able to blame the zika virus for microcephaly neurological malformation and paralysis that results from the use of their products the zika virus will be the perfect scapegoat the list of birth defects being blamed on zika with no evidence is increasing propaganda campaigns always seek to worsen the devastating effects of whatever they want us to fear first we heard that zika causes microcephaly then we heard that it might also cause guillainbarre syndrome now we are hearing that zika causes a whole host of other birth defects some of which might not appear until months or even years after birththe new york times stated the images of babies with microcephaly published tuesday in the journal radiology also suggest a grim possibility because some of the damage was seen in brain areas that continue to develop after birth it may be that babies born without obvious impairment will experience problems as they grow images of another baby girl show contracted hands and arms the result of another common symptom zika seems to damage the nerves in a developing fetus so that sometimes muscles arent developing normally because they dont have the nerve impulses to move normally she dr levine said with such a vicious and unpredictable virus its key to realize that zika is more than microcephaly that theres a number of other abnormalities as theyve shown in this paper and its effects are going to be even more broad said dr spong whose agency has begun a study of what will ultimately be  babies born in zika epidemic areas including brazil and puerto rico its going to be essential to follow them to look at their development to look at their ability to learn to look at hearing problems balance problems behavior problems all those issues to make sure that we dont miss anyone  zika the new scapegoat for all childhood diseases can you tell where this is going it seems to me that they are planning to put together a catalog of major injuries that results from zika infectionit will include most if not all injuries that result from vaccines pesticides gmo food pharmaceutical drugs the highcarbohydrate lowfat standard american diet and anything else that might lead to a successful lawsuit against big pharma or big chem zika might just become the standard defense for suit against corporations it wasnt our product that harmed this little baby it was zika conclusion another government tool for the greater good to strip away freedoms it wont be long before the mainstream media will be showing us pictures of us babies from florida who were born with microcephaly the mainstream media will tug at our heartstrings and will remind us that this horror will soon become preventable when the zika vaccine is developedwe will hear about more and more connections between zika and other terrible health conditions experienced by children we will be told that all this suffering and all this expense will be avoided when all the mosquitoes are killed and everyone receives the zika vaccinemind control programs always talk about the greater good and how individuals must give up their individual freedoms their rights and even their preferences for the sake of the collective benefit zika will be one of the tools used by mind

1012,leaked hillary would completely ban the most popular guns in america,"surgeons admit that mammography is outdated and harmful to women 
friday october   by ethan a huff staff writer tags breast cancer  mammography  harming women naturalnews every year millions of women flock to their doctors to get their annual mammograms a breast cancer screening procedure that involves pressing a womans breasts between two metal platforms to scope out tumors but surgeons everywhere are starting to question the controversial practice  which studies show isnt even an effective screening tool and is actually harmful to the bodies of women who receive itthe public is told that mammograms are the only way to catch breast cancer early but a review of eight scientific trials evaluating the procedure found that mammography is neither effective nor safe after looking at data on more than  women between the ages of  and  who underwent the procedure on a routine basis researchers found that many women are misdiagnosed many of these same women are consequently mistreated with chemotherapy  resulting in their rapid demiseas published in the cochrane database of systematic reviews  the review concluded that mammography causes more harm than good  because many more women end up being misdiagnosed and mistreated than those actually avoiding the development of terminal breast cancer thus the procedure known as mammography is an outdated scourge that belongs in the history books of failed medical treatments and not at the forefront of womens medicineif we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by  and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at  it means that for every  women invited for screening throughout  years one will avoid dying of breast cancer and  healthy women  who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening will be treated unnecessarily the authors concluded group of top medical experts admits mammography does more harm than good one year after this review was published a second one published in the new england journal of medicine nejm came to a similar conclusion a team of medical professionals that included a medical ethicist a clinical epidemiologist a pharmacologist an oncologic surgeon a nurse scientist a lawyer and a health economist decided that the medical industrys claims about the benefits of mammography are essentially bunkthey found that for every  women screened in the us over a year annual screening period beginning at age  one breast cancer death would be prevented while a shocking  to  women would have a false positive while  to  would undergo an unnecessary biopsy between three and  of these women the study found would also be overdiagnosed for a nonmalignant form of cancer that never even would have become clinically apparentthis study out of switzerland corroborates another out of canada  the  canadian national breast screening study  which concluded in lockstep with the others that mammography screenings do not reduce mortality rates from breast cancer any better than a simple physical examination in other words the procedure is completely unnecessary and in many cases exceptionally harmful and on and on the list goes with data out of norway and elsewhere confirming that mammography isnt all that its cracked up to be us data spanning the course of nearly  years shows that more women are over or misdiagnosed with breast cancer because of mammograms than are successfully earlydiagnosed with breast cancer in such a way as to protect against metastasization this represents an exceptionally poor track record that calls into question why mammography continues to be used when it clearly doesnt worki believe that if you did have a tumor the last thing you would want to do is crush that tumor between two plates because that would spread it says general practitioner dr sarah mybill as quoted in the documentary film the promise  sources for this article include",2016-10-26

executive to put her into the white house see the email here hillary clinton known as the bride of frankenfood  is a longtime supporter of monsanto a corporation whose deceptive tactics of collusion intimidation and bullying are a perfect fit for the clinton regime which even a former fbi official now describes as a criminal operation the monsanto operative invited to the fundraiser was none other than charles w burson monsantos former executive vp secretary and general counsel burson who retired from monsanto in  but still maintained an active monsantocom email address all the way through  was praised by monsanto ceo hugh grant for pushing the corporations international imperialism agenda to force patented seeds down the throats of poor farmers in developing nations its sickening via pr newswire  on behalf of the monsanto board of directors and the employees of monsanto i thank charles for his service to our company said hugh grant chairman president and chief executive officer of monsanto during his tenure monsanto successfully transitioned from an agricultural company fueled by its chemistry business to one led by its seeds and traits businesses charles has played an important role in building the companys legal organization to better serve our growing business not only in the united states but also in latin america and asiapacific where farmers are increasingly choosing to plant monsanto seeds and technologies clinton fundraiser sought money from one of the most evil corporations in the history of humankind in other words charles burson was instrumental in monsanto suing farmers whose fields were contaminated by genetically modified monsanto seeds  this legal action by monsanto is globally considered to be one of the most evil antihuman rights abuses of legal power ever witnessed in the modern world yet the hillary clinton campaign saw this man as an opportunity to raise more money to put hillary clinton into the white house where no doubt she would return the favor to monsanto through government policy decisions at the usda and fdafully consistent with the criminal conduct of the clinton crime mafia charles burson also took part in excusing monsantos illegal bribery of over  indonesian officials as part of its international agricultural imperialism march against subsistence farmersafter caught committing massive bribery and collusion in indonesia monsantos then general counsel charles burson explained that no monsanto isnt a bad company theyre super honest and transparent and ethical toothe company has taken remedial actions to address the activities in indonesia at every stage of this process  beginning with our voluntary disclosure and throughout the governmental investigations and settlement process  monsanto has been fully cooperative and has made clear that improper activities will not be tolerated by the company we are pleased today to begin the process of putting these matters to rest wrote burson surprise the justice department then defers prosecution of monsanto and forgets these crimes ever happened whaddaya know with the corrupt lawless justice department calling the shots monsanto was then given a get out of jail free card by the political elite in washingtonfrom the same link above the justice department said it had agreed to defer prosecution on the criminal information for three years saying it would dismiss it after the period if monsanto fully complied with the terms of the agreement so wait you mean to tell me that a corporation which got caught bribing  foreign officials

lying fraud money laundering intimidation of opponents and even murder of those who might testify against her the clinton machine is a mafia operation  and every person involved in it must go to jailthat includes not just the deep operatives like podesta lynch and abedin but also all the deep cover clinton operatives pretending to be journalists  including stephanopoulos maddow hayes milbank and all the rest  see the list here  every one of these people has committed crimes of sedition against the united states of america and is guilty of attempting to defraud democracy steal the election and place a mafia criminal into power at the highest level of government through the deliberate pursuit of journalistic malpractice  seditious clinton operatives must be arrested and put behind bars to protect america we the people are beyond the stage of merely wanting to vote you out of power and turn off your broadcast networks its now time to seek your indictment and imprisonment so that you cannot be allowed to harm this society ever againevery operative journalist and coconspirator with the clinton foundation the clinton corruption and the clinton murders must be arrested indicted and if found guilty by a fair trial sent to prison this nation needs to heal itself from the clinton nightmare  and the only way thats going to happen is if the criminal traitors sellouts and corrupt backstabbers are marched away in handcuffs and put behind barsa former fbi official said sunday that bill and hillary clinton are part of a crime family and argued top officials hindered the investigation into hillary clintons private email server while she was secretary of state reports thehillcom  kallstrom best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of twa flight  in the late s said that hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee was a pathological liarhe also blasted attorney general loretta lynch claiming that she impeded the investigation into clintons private serverthe problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation he said thats the problem they never had a grand jury empanelled and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled im sure is loretta lynch would not go along with that god forbid we put someone like that in the white house he added of clintonkallstrom also said that fbi director james comey and the rest of the fbis leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation not the rest of the bureauthe agents are furious with whats going on i know that for a fact he said corrupt proclinton journalists should not be given any quarter in all this much like the propagandists of the third reich they abuse their positions of power to operate in conspiracy with an outright criminal who acts against the interests of the american people did you know that hillary clinton sold off uranium mining rights to the russians because the oligarchs who made billions off the deal turned around and donated millions to her clinton foundation if you arent aware of this you need to watch clinton cash immediately  the simple truth is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel what america has now come to realize via the wikileaks email dumps  the project veritas undercover videos and even the revelations of former fbi agents who know whats really happening inside the agency is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel from the dnc which actively conspired to sideline bernie sanders during the nomination process to the leftwing media which coordinates false smear attacks against donald trump every element of the democrat party is hopelessly corrupt democrat political operatives abide by no laws no ethics and no boundaries they lie cheat and steal their way into power at every election and theyre desperately trying to steal this election tooits not just that the clinton crime family must be taken down you see its that the entire democrat establishment should be disbanded or imprisoned  there isnt a highlevel operative inside the dnc who isnt committing election fraud on a daily basis the coordination and collusion money laundering and paytoplay influence for sale schemes are all illegal yet they are the very foundation of the democrat establishment as it exists todayevery one of these people needs to be arrested indicted and imprisoned this is the only way genuine democracy can be restored across america aside from their criminality democrats policy ideas just dont work even on policy alone democrats are total failures  none of their ideas or policies actually work look at obamacare with its insurance costs now doubling every  years  with coverage options crashing nationwide and the entire failed idea now on the verge of imploding this was hailed as an historic solution by obama and the rest of the dummocrats who forced it through congress and the supreme court in reality obamacare was the dumbest idea ever attempted to solve the health care crisis and i called it that from its inceptiondemocrats are parasites on society who know nothing other than how to survive as government blood suckers by promising big ideas that routinely fail they confiscate money from taxpayers waste it on the most stupid policy ideas ever dreamed up while siphoning off billions for their own salaries bonuses and luxurious

1023,beware you could be poisoning yourself by reheating these five foods,"mutiny at the fbi comey warned by his own agents to indict clinton or watch the fbis reputation go down in flames 
monday october   tags james comey  fbi mutiny  clinton investigation naturalnews as america inches toward open revolt over the runaway criminality and collusion of the democrats and the media  another kind of revolt is taking place inside the fbi according to multiple sources in the independent media  now the only remaining free press in america  fbi director james comey was forced into announcing a reopening of the criminal investigation into hillary clintons private email server by livid fbi agents who threatened to go public if comey didnt actjames comey long since suspected to be a clinton operative who deliberately allowed hillary clinton to get away with a vast number of felony crimes and national security violations now finds himself with his back against the wall if he releases the evidence against hillary clinton already possessed by the fbi he will face the wrath of obama the clintons the corrupt loretta lynch doj and the entire leftist media if he once again gives hillary clinton a free pass on her numerous crimes he then faces a mutiny inside the fbi which promises to bypass his authority and leak the criminal evidence directly to the alternative media fbi agents under comey are desperately trying to save their agency from going down in flames agents inside the fbi in other words refuse to allow james comey to let the agency go down in flames as just another corrupt branch of the clinton crime family via the daily mail uk  james comeys decision to revive the investigation of hillary clintons email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the fbi  including some of his top deputies according to a source close to the embattled fbi director this dovetails with my own sources who tell me that the recent acquittal of the oregon ranchers has also driven a stake through james comeys reputation as he is the fbi official who reportedly ordered the execution of robert lavoy finicum whose suspected execution by fbi agents was caught on tape because the oregon ranchers have now been acquitted by a jury it means fbi head james comey seems to have ordered the shooting and killing of an innocent man under comey  and to the dismay of the many great agents working inside the fbi  comey may have turned the agency toward a lawless armed tyranny that guns down innocent americans while letting corrupt criminal politicians go free for many fbi agents who have spent their entire careers serving the fbi as honest dedicated federal agents the thought of allowing james comey to singlehandedly commit political arson and burn down the fbis hardwon reputation is just too much to bearresignations are beginning to pile up on comeys desk as livid fbi agents head for the exitsvia the daily mail the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source a close friend who has known comey for nearly two decades comey told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom and while the decision to reopen the case may appease fbi agents and republicans in the shortterm we suspect it does very little to restore overall faith in his competence as such we continue to question just how long comey can hold out before being forced to resign his post adds zero hedge  at a bare minimum in light of his continued questionable judgement and serious doubts raised about the integrity of the first investigation we fail to understand how an independent investigation into hillarys email server isnt warranted james comey is an arsonist and hes going to burn the fbi to the ground unless his agents mutiny the upshot of all this is that james comey is an arsonist if his own agents dont force him to apply the law to the clinton investigations comey will burn the agency to the ground leaving its reputation in ashes and that sadly will make the world a very dangerous place for all the fbi agents in the field because everyday americans would begin to see them all as corrupt lawless tyrants working as part of a criminal regime in washington that refuses to apply laws to its own kindthe truth is that most fbi agents are hard working professional men and women who are desperately trying to shut down the operations of terrorists financial fraudsters kidnappers murderers and other dangerous criminals yet if james comey doesnt defend the fbis reputation by indicting hillary clinton  he will likely be placing fbi field agents in grave danger as they face the wrath of citizens who begin to see them all as part of a corrupt criminal tyranny run by the political mafia in dccomey in other words is more dangerous to the entire fbi than any other single person in washington right now if he doesnt find his moral compass and guide the fbi through this crisis with law and order intact hes going to go down in history and in flames as the man who forever destroyed the credibility of the fbi and likely turned his field agents into ready targets for an enraged populaceno doubt hell get an extra bonus from loretta lynch if he once again decides to nullify the rule of law in america and announce that hillary wont be subject to the same laws that would immediately ensnare anyone else remember if comey gives hillary clinton a free pass he demonstrates to all americans that lawlessness is now the accepted standard of conduct in washington  and if our political leaders will not be held to account for their crimes then practically speaking why should any citizen feel compelled to follow any federal laws at all james comey if you want to salvage the fbis reputation announce a recommendation for the indictment of both hillary clinton and loretta lynch if theres one thing abundantly clear in all this its that both hillary clinton and loretta lynch should be behind bars  clinton is a lifelong criminal and mafia boss lynch is a thirdrate attorney who was tossed into the doj solely because of her gender and skin color not her credentials and neither one respects the laws of america of course both are deeply corruptif the fbi hopes to have any reputation remaining after the hillary clinton campaign implodes either before or on november th comey needs to come out strong right now and lay out the evidence that unambiguously shows hillary clinton had clear intent to violate national security laws  among other serious crimesall comey would have to say is something like in the view of the fbi hillary clinton is clearly not qualified to serve as commander in chief and we recommend she be indicted for violations of national security and so on with a single sentence comey could reinvigorate the fbi and position himself as an historic american heroright now id imagine the clinton machine is mailing bloody body parts in tiny wooden coffins to james comeys home address along with notes that say something like youre next lets watch and see if he grows a spine and refuses to be

low cholesterol and its consequence 

previously we have seen that cholesterol is a critical element of our cells and tissues  in addition scientific evidence suggests that high cholesterol is not necessarily harmful but offers a protective effect against brain disorders such as alzheimers disease  at this point we should ask the opposite question what about if we have too little cholesterol what are the consequences 

without cholesterol we would die 
it is well known today that cholesterol performs several important functions in the body one of the best important is not the most important function of cholesterol is to assist the proper regulation of the immune system indeed people who have a low blood cholesterol have an anergic immune system ie a lack of reaction by the bodys defense mechanisms to foreign substances vredevoe et al  in other words your body cannot fight off pathogens such as bacteria viruses parasites and fungi without cholesterol the different cells involved in an immune response such as macrophages lymphocytes etc cannot recognize the invaders and destroy them interestingly it was shown that the ldl particles are the ones needed for an adequate immune response masterjohn  these particles neutralize microbes and toxins before they cause any damage to the tissuesorgans and we call these ldl particles bad cholesterol without them we would be dead another fact is that a low blood cholesterol increases our risks of developing tuberculosis 
more importantly a sufficient supply of cholesterol to the immune system is critical to eliminate cancer cells indeed cholesterol is needed to slow down the progression of cancer in addition to cholesterol saturated fats like palmitic and myristic acids are also necessary for an optimum immune system these fats are found in tropical oil such as coconut oil would this fact explain why asian people have a lower rate of cancer than north americans 

is cholesterol protective not causative of heart disease 
there is a tremendous amount of evidence to suggest that microbial infections are one of the primary drive force of plaque accumulation in the arteries of the heart   in support of this a lack of buccal hygiene considerably increases your risk of heart disease  some researchers have noticed that people who suffered from a heart attack also had the flu a few days prior   it seems that those microorganisms change the structure of the blood vessels leading to inflammation and an accumulation of plaques at the sites of injury based on this evidence we can propose that cholesterol actually minimizes the risk of developing heart disease via the elimination of dangerous pathogens indeed it seems to be the case  
it is time to end this war on cholesterol science is very clear cholesterol does not cause heart disease on the contrary cholesterol is a vital element of a vibrant health by making sure the immune system is strong by being a critical component of vitamin d synthesis by helping the body make sex hormones among other functions",2016-10-27

if you clicked a link that got you to this page you cant pretend that you are not interested in homesteading any longer im not sure if you are afraid of the effort afraid that you wont know what to do or what you are afraid of but its time to get up and get going 
i have been homesteading for over  years and wouldnt change it for anything in the world my husband and i have made many mistakes along the way but we have never been afraid to put in the hard work to get any job done for all our hard work we have become one of the rare profitable homesteads that are more than just surviving 
we all have our own reasons that we want to try homesteading so dont base yours off of mine i am just hoping to spark some interest to get you off your feet so you can make your dream become a reality i provide healthy food for my family 
we are not vegan vegetarian of allergic to gluten but we are completely aware of what we are putting into our bodies i just dont like to buy vegetables from the grocery store that have been produced chemically i also dont like to buy meat that was fed all sorts of things that i dont know about 
everything that i put on my kitchen table to feed my family has been grown or produced by me or someone i know i know that the corn we ate last night was grown using some organic soil water and a little alpaca poop for good measure the pork also came from our farm and i know about everything that pig ate in his very happy two years of life 
im not saying that we are the healthiest family in the world but i know we arent eating chemicals  that is what matters to me and my husband the food tastes so much better 
the food that we produce on our homestead is so much better that the food you are purchasing at the grocery store the truth is that they are looking to produce as much perfect looking food as they can as fast as they can they dont want to grow the strands of produce that take a little longer but taste exponentially better 
the meat also takes better because you arent rushing that either not to mention the fact that you are feeding the animals with healthier and better tasting food when you slaughter the food yourself it will taste better as well animals that are stressed when they get slaughtered produce meat that is much tougher that meat that we produce here on the homestead freedom 
not many people can say that they have complete freedom to do what they please during the day now that doesnt mean that we dont have responsibilities but we can take an hour off in the middle of the day to attend the elementary school winter concert we can also take those doctor appointments in the middle of the day when the office isnt insane 
if you want to get freedom over your own life start homesteading today  we have economic security 
if the economy crashes we are not in risk of going without anything that we really need we dont rely on anyone for any of the basic necessities including a source of income we have everything that we need in order to survive right here on the homestead there isnt much that can go wrong with the government that could put us at risk 
i am not an apocalypse prepper but i will say that homesteaders are more prepared should a disaster occur we have more knowledge and experience in all of the tasks needed in an extreme survival situation than most people i know our kids understand the meaning of hard work 
im not saying that your kids dont understand the meaning of hard work but my kids have been there and done that my nine year old wakes up two hours before school and takes care of the chickens every day those chickens are completely her responsibility and she know that 
i do allow my kids to use electronics during down time they just know the difference between down time and chore time they feel like they are part of the team so it doesnt feel like we are making them do chores every day you might also like",2016-10-27
1029,why marijuana should be legalized across the globe,"keywords complimentary medicine  holistic health  homeopathy  nhs 
the department for health is currently reviewing whether or not homeopathy in the nhs should continue to be available through doctor referrals against a backdrop of funding cuts and increasing pressure to reduce costs the government and health managers are looking at whether to add homeopathy to the nhss schedule  blacklist a selection of products that nhs doctors are banned from prescribing 
however despite consistent claims that there is a lack of quality evidence into the positive health benefits of homeopathy the nhs has spent more than m on homeopathic treatments over the last  years and any proposed ban is likely to have its fair share of detractors 
almost six million brits seek the help complementary and alternative medicine of which homeopathy is a part with one in four wanting access to be universally available through the nhs 
the lead argument for the exclusion of homeopathic treatment is lack of evidence that supports its effectiveness with research often being labeled as inconclusive however proponents for the inclusion of homeopathy argue that this doesnt necessarily mean that there is no evidence 
dr helen beaumont a gp and the president of the faculty of homeopathy has recently stated that homeopathic treatment has a profound effect on patients 
its disappointing that at a time when the nhs is facing a funding crisis the department of health is embarking on a costly consultation that could prevent highly skilled clinicians prescribing a course of treatment that benefits thousands of patients each year if the department were serious about saving money surely it should be looking at ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors prescribed for mild to moderate depression in vast quantities at considerable cost to the nhs but which studies have found to be ineffective for those conditions 
george freeman the minister for life sciences has stated that in a time of rising demand the government has a duty to ensure nhs funds are spent only on the most effective treatments however an article in the british medical journal bmj that examined the scientific evidence behind nhs treatments found that  of  commonly used nhs treatments are of unknown effectiveness and only  are known to be beneficial the argument is being made that the principals being applied to homeopathy are consistent for all forms of treatments throughout the nhs 
collating research itself has also proved to be difficult with the positive effects of homeopathy often a challenge to fully quantify the nhs is driven by targets and trial evidence using hard data like death and disease to determine the effectiveness of a particular treatment researching and recording a patients quality of life happiness and emotional satisfaction has always been much more difficult to quantify but a wealth of anecdotal evidence and studies from other european countries continue to support the use of homeopathic treatment 
for example in  over a hundred homeopathic gp practices in germany and switzerland took up the challenge  of demonstrating the health of chronically ill patients after eight years of homeopathic treatment it concluded that homeopathy is clinically effective costeffective and safe  with the results playing an important role in the inclusion of homeopathy as part of their national healthcare scheme 
similarly the largest study at bristol homeopathic hospital  followed the effectiveness of homeopathy on  consecutive patients over a sixyear period  of followup patients reported improved health with  reporting major improvement 
the debate whether homeopathy in the nhs will no doubt continue the homeopathic profession has had to face increasing criticism and hostility over recent years but with an average annual spend of  on homeopathic treatment the equivalent of  of the total nhs drug budget it should be remembered that if these patients were not treated with homeopathic medicines they would have to be treated by other nhs departments with potentially more expensive conventional drugs   bmc public health bmc series    doi

in a study of  children who were treated with chinese medicinal herbs the treatment reduced eczema symptoms by  in  of the children see sources although it was a small study size the benefits seem to far outweigh the risks when my son was a baby even a  improvement in his symptoms would have been amazing for us reason  acupuncture does not hurt babies 
many people worry about the needles hurting but the needles that acupuncturists use are about  th of a syringe needle my son was a baby when we started the treatments and he never cried out when getting the needles in him reason  acupuncture relieved my babys eczema by  
acupuncture healed the eczema to the point where we could figure out his triggers our doctor stabilized the eczema best of all flareups only occurred when my baby was teething his skin was softer than it had been in months acupuncture needs to be done on babies for a minimum of  months in order to see an improvement this is because the treatment is trying to alter the immune response which is a long process but sometimes babies will respond quicker than that we used a topical herb powder given to us by the doctor and applied it to his skin this topical mix had a similar effect as hydrocortisone cream if i applied it  times per day with a cotton ball reason  acupuncture is affordable 
this is true especially if you go to a student clinic you can pay the affordable price and yet the students are supervised by very experienced doctors for child and baby treatments it is even more affordable it cost us about  per visit on average we tried a few different clinics some health plans will cover acupuncture so check with your health plan to see if yours covers it to keep it affordable i suggest trying to find a specialist in acupuncture  tcm traditional chinese medicine not a practitioner who does many different types of treatments tips for helping your child while getting acupuncture 
bring a favorite stuffed animal a book or some toys try nursing your baby while they are receiving acupuncture a baby only needs the needle in the acupressure point for a second and then they are pulled out adults typically have needles in for  minutes for each treatment because our bodies do not respond as quickly as babies bodies do check out my youtube video for more tips find an experienced  accredited acupuncturist 
make sure to look for an accredited acupuncturist or tcm traditional chinese medicine doctor be sure the acupuncturist has some experience in your condition chat with the people in the waiting room and see if theyve had success with your doctor i met a few moms in the waiting room that swore by the chinese doctor we were going to see that made me feel more comfortable 
find a tcm traditional chinese medicine doctor who offers certified organic chinese herbs certified organic means the herbs were never sprayed with toxic pesticides and herbicides as well there have been some reports of heavy metals residue in chinese herbs herbs are just as powerful as prescription medications and can have adverse effects if used improperly make sure to ask about the testing done on the herbs that you or your baby are prescribed every condition has different treatment needs 
check with your family doctor to be sure you dont have any conditions that would prevent you from using acupuncture or chinese medicine all the information in this article is provided for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for medical counseling

1032,top  pet care tips,"keywords election   rigged election  voting  voting errors  voting machines malfunction voting machines malfunction 
this is just a straight up fact especially since many of our voting machines are so antiquated as you vote this year you should watch out for these glitches sometimes the votes appear to be flipped as in a voter intends to vote for candidate a but candidate bs name is selected on the screen 
when this happens it is known as vote flipping and is supposed to only happen rarely with millions of votes cast there have supposedly only been a few hundred reports of vote flipping every year for the past decade these are the ones reported so you do wonder whether this happens unnoticed much more often im just saying im seeing reports of this specifically happening all around the country so cast your vote and double check check your ballot after you cast your vote and if it happens to you call on a poll worker to help get it fixed remember voting machine malfunctions do happen 
there are reports of this happening already in north carolina texas and nevada with machines vote flipping in the last couple weeks 
you have to remember that the majority of the machines in use today predate the iphone or the ipad and most of them use technology from the late s lawrence norden a voting technology expert at the brennan center for justice in new york told time as these machines age you start to have hardware issues 
one problem that also occurs on older machines is the glue that attaches the screen to the machine breaks down and you can get alignment issues as well poll workers and technicians need to reset the machines regularly to ensure the buttons are lined up right in other cases it can just be a user error because no one uses the type of equipment used at the voting centers on a regular basis 
in texas voters reported attempting to vote a straight republican ticket but found the clintonkaine ticket selected instead this can be found specifically in voting districts where they use the old rotarystyle voting machine 
if you select one candidate and the other appears on the screen or if youre looking at the summary screen and it just isnt right voters should notify the poll workers they can cancel out your session so you can do it over poll from presstvcom ",2016-10-27

keywords best foods for eye health  betacarotene  cataracts  eye health  foods that contain antioxidants  free radicals  lutein  macular degeneration  maintaining healthy eyes  mesozeaxanthin  natural vision training  naturally occurring antioxidants  ocular migraines  optic nerve damage  protect your eyes  vitamin c  vitamin e  zeaxanthin 
when most people think about their eye health  the first thing that comes to mind is whether or not they need to wear glasses although your vision is a major part of your overall eye health there are actually many more things that you need to be concerned about for example there are a staggering  common disorders that can plague your eyes these issues range from cataracts to ocular migraines fortunately there are many natural methods you can utilize to help keep your eyes healthy 
nutrients your eyes need 
there are three nutrients that are known to be critical for maintaining healthy eyes lutein zeaxanthin and mesozeaxanthin each of these nutrients serves as an antioxidant that helps protect your eyes from the damaging effects of free radicals as natural news has pointed out before free radicals are the main basis of all injuries illnesses and deaths 
antioxidants are the only way to fight free radicals so its a good thing that these three nutrients are found naturally in the human eye but what happens when something interrupts this process sadly you can end up with a long list of eye health problems that may even lead to blindness 
instead of merely sitting back and allowing this to happen you can be proactive and start taking supplements the good news is that lutein and zeaxanthin supplements are easy to find research has discovered that most of these supplements also contain mesozeaxanthin although this isnt usually disclosed on the label in fact it sounds likely that this recently discovered eye nutrient is a natural byproduct of lutein and zeaxanthin 
of course this doesnt absolve the supplement companies of their duty to report whether or not mesozeaxanthin is present in their products however their negligence also doesnt reduce the natural reliance that your eyes have on all three of these nutrients in addition to stocking up on these supplements it is also wise to increase your intake of other naturally occurring antioxidants including vitamin e vitamin c and beta carotene 
food sources 
there are many foods that contain antioxidants  carrots are perhaps the most wellknown resource for eye health because they are so rich in beta carotene it would be a mistake to think of carrots as the prime resource though you can also turn to oranges tomatoes sweet potatoes and dark berries for a mixture of necessary vitamins these are some of the best foods for eye health even better you can derive lutein and zeaxanthin directly from food sources such as eggs pistachios corn peppers and kale with enough of these food items in your diet you can avoid the cost of supplements while still keeping your eyes extremely healthy 
additional eye health tips 
if you are a smoker who is also concerned about eye health now is a good time to carefully consider quitting unfortunately people who smoke have an increased risk of developing macular degeneration optic nerve damage and cataracts if you begin abstaining from tobacco products now though your odds of ending up with one of these eye health complications will begin to decline 
other easy steps you can take to protect your eyes include always wearing sunglasses during sunny days and steering clear of computer screens as much as possible if you use a computer for work take a  second vision break every  minutes 
ultimately combining the proper nutrients with easy tips such as wearing sunglasses will help keep your eyes healthy throughout your life if youre currently dealing with issues such as light sensitivity and vision loss you may also be able to naturally regain control of your eye health by using natural vision training and other eye exercises this is definitely a better option than undergoing a surgery that has an extensive list of serious risks and usually leaves patients still needing eyeglasses as usual the natural way is better 
about the author 
jade rich is an lpn and director at an inpatient rehabilitation center as a mother of three children she is always looking for natural ways to keep her kids eyes healthy she knows from experience that another way to do this is by scheduling them for routine eye exams this helps with early detection and prevention its best to schedule this during the backtoschool season during the visit their pediatrician examines their eye alignment and gives a test for visual acuity

switch to an alkaline diet 
theres been a neverending argument about whether alkaline diets reduce acidity in the body or not in fact some experts have discredited them as useless but what does research say well this study found that alkaline diet enhances excretion of uric acid through urine on the other hand researchers found that acidic foods reduce excretion of uric acid 
another study affirms that alkaline diets can help reduce uric acid in the body and they can prevent uric acid crystallization in joints 
note that more research needs to be conducted on effect of diet on uric acid crystal

1049,volunteers succeed at eliminating food waste and hunger,"keywords alzhemiers disease  anxiety  dementia  depression  food  health  ibd  ibs  immune system  mental health  nutrition  weight loss fermented foods  reasons to consume this food group every day 
im sure you have heard about fermented foods and are wondering if this is just a fad here are some reasons why fermented foods should not be just a fad but a food group to keep in your diet daily what are fermented foods 
bacteria and yeast are used as part of the fermentation process that gives these foods a nutritional boost the bacteria convert sugars and starches into lactic acid through a process called lactofermentation the yeast undergoes a process called ethanol fermentation 
these yeasts and bacteria that undergo the fermentation process boosts the nutritional content of the food what it does to the food provides beneficial bacteria that promote gut health provides beneficial enzymes increases the amount of b vitamins biotin and folate increases the bioavailability of minerals provides short chain fatty acids which helps to improve your immune function provides you with gaba your calming neurotransmitter how can eating fermented foods help me optimize your gut health 
why this may not seem like a big deal it is your immune system is in your gut and much of your serotonin is made in your gut your gut may be in bad shape from nsaids antibiotics unknown food allergies the standard american diet and more 
ideally you want more good bacteria populating your gut as opposed to bad bacteria fermented foods can help shift the balance since most people who consume the standard american crap food diet have a disrupted microbiome 
so you can take all the supplements in the world but if your gut is in bad shape are you even absorbing and benefiting from these supplements or are you just wasting your money 
a healthy gut can help to balance and support your endocrine system immune system digestive system and nervous system so as you can see a healthy gut is critical to your wellbeing support your immune system 
the more beneficial bacteria you have the stronger your immune system is to fight off colds flu allergies and more almost  of your immune system is found in your gut thus it stands to reason that to maintain a strong immune system one needs to support their gut health 
asthma and autoimmune conditions among numerous other health issues are all linked to having fewer good bacteria in your gut the less diverse your microbiota is the greater association with many chronic health issues 
adding in probiotic rich fermented foods can also shorten the duration of a cold or upper respiratory infection aid in weight loss 
studies show that those with certain healthy bacteria in their gut can maintain a healthy weight while those with more negative strains have a greater incidence of gaining weightdifficulty losing weight obese people have different gut bacteria than lean individuals 
in a  study it was found that kimchee had a significant impact on weight and body fat of those who are overweight and obese in the study in a  study obese people were assigned to drink fermented milk for  weeks those that drank the fermented milk had significant fat loss as compared to the control group digestivebowel issue improvement 
those with ibs or ibd may have reduced symptoms of diarrhea and constipation when fermented foods are added into the daily diet dr david williams states that to eliminate digestive issues you need to improve the balance in the gut microbiome and one of the most effective ways of doing so is by adding in fermented foods kefir in studies has shown to improve symptoms of ibs and ibd research has shown that anywhere from  to  of those who make this change adding in fermented foods will notice a significant difference in their ibs symptoms improved mental health mood control and behavior 
the gut is considered your second brain a healthy gut therefore can mean a healthy brain several probiotic strains have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in short term studies for this reason to get more variety of probiotic strains it is best to not stick with the same fermented food to eat over and over mix it up for instance have kefir one day kombucha the next fermented vegetables the next day and so forth 
many of you know that gaba is your calming neurotransmitter but did you know that fermented foods can supply you with gaba too oral administration of fermented rice bran and other traditional fermented foods have been shown to increase gaba content significantly whereas gaba in the oral form may have limited benefits due to absorption issues 
another study looking at  college students found that those who ate a variety of fermented foods has less negative emotions than before such as anxiety fear moodiness worry envy frustration and loneliness 
it is possible that the fermented foods not only healed leaky gut but also provided some needed gaba even in psychiatry they are starting to recognize the benefits of fermented foods for mood disorders reduce the risk of brain diseases such as alzheimers 
some scientists have recently begun to consider the possibility that alzheimers disease is in fact an autoimmune disease and as many of you may know having one autoimmune condition puts you at risk for more autoimmune conditions down the road for any autoimmune disease the immune system must be supported so it would make sense that gut health needs to be addressed for ad if you want to support your brain than i suggest that you add in fermented foods 
along with the benefits above fermented foods can also benefit those with autism and help prevent hpylori you dont need a whole lot of fermented foods daily start with small amounts until you know how your body will react and slowly build your way up to say  tablespoons of fermented vegetables or a cup of kefir per day what to add in 

look for the product to say raw and fermented these foods should be in the refrigerator section of the store sauerkraut or other fermented vegetables  eat these cold dont heat them up bubbies pickles is a great way to get introduced to fermented foods kimchee  this is a korean version of fermented cabbage carrots onions and garlic kefir usually made from cows milk but is also made from goat milk or coconut milk it has more of a drinkable texture than yogurt i buy goat milk kefir and find that it is relatively thick and mix in some of my paleo granola and have this for breakfast if you suspect any issues with milk it is best to opt for the coconut kefir or the goat milk kefir if you have asthma or chronic sinus congestion avoid the kefir until issues resolve opt for the other fermented choices instead tempeh indonesian type of cake with a nutty taste and chewy texture a good vegan source of protein too kombucha  a fizzy fermented tea most stores carry a variety of flavors now dont go overboard on the kombucha however some people who drink kombucha in excess amounts ie several bottles per day report symptoms of gas and bloating miso a fermented soybean paste which can be used in soups and sauces a miso broth soup is a great way to start a meal and very easy to make 
notice i did not sat yogurt while some yogurts may contain some probiotics many others are sugary processed foods in disguise yogurt is also not going to pack as powerful of a punch as the abovementioned foods

1050,natural remedies that will help you get rid of blackheads quickly,"what we all should be doing first thing in the morning a simple cheap and effective way to jump start your metabolism weight loss and improve your health 
what if i told you that by doing this every day making it part of your morning routine just like brushing your teeth would help you to lose weight flush out toxins hydrate your body and skin improve brain function give you more energy and decrease your appetite would you do it 
drinking water upon rising in the morning can have huge health benefits some people call it water therapy and has its origination in ayurvedic medicine it is purported to help with numerous diseases such as cancer asthma high blood pressure arthritis diabetes and migraines 
to reap the benefits drink the water upon waking ideally  minutes before you eat and make it part of your morning routine most us are walking around in a dehydrated state so start your day off the right way 
ideally filtered water that is void of chemicals and fluoride is best i personally like the berkey filter system as this is affordable for many instead of a whole house system most water pitchers are ineffective for removing most of the chemicals in our water but there are a couple good ones out there such as the clearly filtered pitcher but even if you dont have a water filter system it does not mean you should not drink up 
for most people  oz of water in the morning is the right amount others say to drink double this amount this may be a lot of water to consume for most people first thing in the morning my suggestion would be to start out with  oz and slowly work your way up to the higher amount and see how you feel moderation is key as too little or too much water is never a good thing 
the  glasses filled with  oz of water is a myth and no science behind this reasoning another simple rule is to divide your body weight in half and drink this amount in ounces but if you are a large person this may feel like you are spending your day drinking water 
instead focus on getting that glass of water first thing in the day and then add in water herbal teas fruits and vegetables during the day if your urine is very pale yellow throughout the day then you are hydrated if it is a bright yellow to orange drink up riboflavin a b vitamin can make your urine a bright yellow benefits to drinking water first thing in the morning it can jump start your metabolism 
it can increase your metabolism by  for the first  minutes after consuming that glass of water another study showed that it can increase your metabolic rate by  for the next  minutes after the water is consumed hydration this is more important that you think when dehydrated we may experience brain fog lack of energy and metal clarity hydrating in the morning can increase the flow of oxygen which is energizing hydrating will also help the skin to look younger flushes out toxins 
support your kidneys by helping them to flush out toxins and give your body the water it needs first thing in the am speed up the detox process by adding a tablespoon of lemon juice to your morning water this is best done prior to brushing your teeth in the morning as the film on your teeth will protect the enamel from the acidity in the lemon juice support brain health 
your brain tissue is  water not having enough water can make you feel tired drained and can cause mood swings prevent you from overeating just by drinking water you feel full studies show that those who consume water before every meal lost an average of  pounds over a threemonth period thats with no dieting not changing your eating habitsjust adding in water less colds and flu 
staying hydrated helps to maintain the health of your lymphatic system which also affects how your body fights off infection 
if you are looking for a simple cheap and effective way to improve your health and stimulate weight loss then this is it

1052,how to survive a nuclear fallout,"keywords medical equipment  stethoscope facts  stethoscopes history 
when we hear the word doctor the first image comes in our mind is a person in a white coat with a stethoscope hanging around his neck the stethoscope has become a very common name amongst people thanks to its display in various tv shows movies and frequent use of it by doctors but still there are many fun facts which other people might not know about stethoscope so here they are  
 years old history  yes stethoscopes are one of the oldest inventions which are still being used across the world by millions of doctors rene laennec in  had invented the stethoscope it was a wooden instrument and looked quite different from what we see it as now 
i see your chest  stethoscope is a greek word which roughly translates into i see the chest stethos means chest and scope mean examination 
an interesting story behind its invention  when stethoscope was not invented doctors would put their ears around the chest of patients and gently tap the chest with fingers this technique would make female patients little uncomfortable rene laennec was a very shy person once he was examining an overweight woman he found it difficult to hear her hear sounds to hear heartbeats of that lady he rolled a quire paper into a tube and placed it on her chest this inspired him to make the device which we all are familiar with and called stethoscope 
google doodle for rene laennec  on february th  rene laennec would have celebrated his th birthday to commemorate this day google doodle marked his th birthday 
used to identify if a person is dead or not 
nowadays stethoscope is used to hear heart sounds and to determine symbols of other diseases but initially stethoscope was designed to find out if the person in the hospital is dead or alive 
it might be replaced very soon 
as mentioned stethoscopes were invented almost  years ago and being in use for such a long time shows that how useful and efficient stethoscopes are however as the technology is getting advanced every passing day stethoscopes might be replaced very soon by pocketsized ultrasonic devices which can perform multiple measurements on patients

1053,what happens to our lungs brain  mood when we use a himalayan salt lamps,"keywords cranberries  cranberry  cranberry juice  kidney disease  urinary tract infections  uti  utis 
cranberry juice and tablets have been recommended as a way to either prevent recurring urinary tract infection uti or treat the symptoms but a new study finds theres no difference between people treated with cranberries or placebos 
a lack of evidence for cranberry juice or capsules as being an effective preventative measure or treatment has been a recurring argument in the scientific literature for years now cranberry juice  an unrealistic recommendation for utis 
a urinary tract infection occurs when bacteria gets into your urine and travels up to your bladder according to the urinary care foundation  utis cause more than  million visits to health care providers each year about  in  women and  in  men will have symptoms of at least one uti during their lifetime 
for years now cranberry juice has been recommended to aid in preventing or treating utis however theres no solid evidence that any amount is having a positive effect 
additionally based on the results of a recent study led by infectious disease specialist manisha juthanimehta from the yale school of medicine even if you switch to highly concentrated capsules you still dont see a noticeable positive effect 
in response to this recent study lindsay e nicolle an expert on utis from the university of manitoba advises the following 
the continuing promotion of cranberry use to prevent recurrent uti in the popular press or online advice seems inconsistent with the reality of repeated negative studies or positive studies compromised by methodological shortcomings 
nicolle adds clinicians should not be promoting cranberry use by suggesting that there is proven or even possible benefit any continued promotion of the use of cranberry products seems to go beyond available scientific evidence and rational reasoning it is time to move on from cranberries myth versus facts 
theres a couple of reasons why the myth that cranberry juice is beneficial in preventing and treating utis has persisted for so long 
first the active ingredient in cranberries  atype proanthocyanidins pacs  has been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to the wall of the bladder so a vast majority of people have reasoned that if bacteria are causing utis something that blocks bacteria from accumulating in the bladder could be a potential preventive or treatment measure 
but according to timothy boone md phd vice dean of the texas am health science center college of medicine houston campus and chairperson of the department of urology for houston methodist hospital theres one problem  
cranberry juice especially the juice concentrates you find at the grocery store will not treat a uti or bladder infection it can offer more hydration and possibly wash bacteria from your body more effectively but the active ingredient in cranberry is longgone by the time it reaches your bladder 
dr boone adds it takes an extremely large concentration of cranberry to prevent bacterial adhesion this amount of concentration is not found in the juices we drink theres a possibility it was stronger back in our grandparents day but definitely not in modern times 
for example ocean sprays cranberry juice cocktail is only  percent juice something so watered down could not be so ineffective 
the second reason the myth continues is that its a tempting myth to believe if you experience recurring utis and want to prevent them  or you want to feel empowered while youre waiting for the antibiotics to take effect  drinking cranberry juice or taking capsules is a fairly easy and simple way to feel like youre helping resolve your problem 
unfortunately though youre paying a lot of money for something thats only really doing the same job as a glass of water and cranberry juice is full of sugar anyway golden rules for kidney health 
you can do a number of things to help keep your kidneys functioning properly at every stage of life 
heres a list of ways to reduce the risk of kidney disease  including urinary tract infections drink plenty of liquids especially water  drinking water helps dilute your urine and ensures that youll urinate more frequently  allowing bacteria to be flushed from your urinary tract before an infection can begin stay active and keep fit  keeping fit helps to reduce your blood pressure staying active and keeping fit also reduces the risk of chronic kidney disease eat healthy and keep your weight in check  this can help prevent diabetes heart disease and other debilitating conditions associated with chronic kidney disease reduce your salt intake  the recommended sodium intake is  grams of salt per day  around a teaspoon try limiting the amount of processed and restaurant food and dont add salt to food its easier to control your salt intake if you prepare the food yourself with fresh ingredients dont take overthecounter pills on a regular basis  common nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs  like ibuprofen  are known to cause kidney damage and disease if taken regularly this type of medication probably doesnt pose considerable danger if your kidneys are reasonably healthy and you use them for emergencies only however if you are dealing with chronic pain  like back pain or arthritis  work with your doctor to find natural ways to control your pain without putting your kidneys at risk wipe from front to back  doing so after urinating and after a bowel movement helps prevent bacteria in the anal region from spreading to the vagina and urethra change your birth control method  diaphragms or unlubricated or spermicidetreated condoms can all contribute to bacterial growth avoid potentially irritating feminine products  using deodorant sprays or other feminine products such as douches and powders in the genital area can irritate the urethra empty your bladder soon after intercourse  also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria regularly control of your blood sugar level  about half of people who have diabetes develop kidney damage so it is important for people with diabetes to have regular tests to check their kidney functions

democratic national committee was caught again passing debate questions from the network to the clinton campaign during the democratic primary reports breitbartcom dirty donna brazile was caught so blatantly that even cnn had to fire her to create the appearance that cnn is still engaged in something resembling ethical journalism funneling town hall and debate questions to hillary clinton days before the events the daily caller adds even more stunning revelations to the depths of cheating carried out by dirty donna brazile on behalf of the corrupt criminalminded clintons donna brazile the interim chair of the democratic national committee began providing town hall and debate questions to the clinton campaign earlier than previously known emails released by wikileaks on monday showthe

intimidate their way to power election after election they live as legally immune parasites feeding off the blood sweat and tears of the american middle class who are barely staying afloat while washington elitists like brazile abedin and clinton dine on luxury meals like a disturbing scene out of the hunger games but its not president snow we have to worry about in the real world its the haunting possibility of a president clinton why we the people must never allow hillary clinton to seize the white house we the people must never allow hillary clinton to seize the white house we must halt this sociopathic liar and cheater at the ballot box on november th and once thats accomplished we must petition president trump to relentlessly pursue criminal indictments of the hundreds of seditious traitors inside the clinton regime who have blatantly violated numerous federal laws to commit massive fraud and attempted theft of power across americathere are literally hundreds of these democrat criminals who need to be locked up for life they are a danger to democracy and a danger to a free society they are sociopaths liars cheats and even murderers they are fraudsters and political con artists who prey upon the weakminded ie democrats who are still so stupid and clueless that theyre voting for hillary  if we dont stop them now they threaten to turn america into a fourth reich  complete with the mass murder of political dissidents and the silencing of all critics of the clinton regimethese democrats like dirty donna brazile want to run america like haiti  complete with all the corruption bribery scandals and economic collapse that third world countries routinely sufferbut filthy scumbags like brazile are about to find out something rather shocking we the people wont tolerate your lies and corruption any longer we the people are going to arrest you indict you prosecute you and see you and your coconspirators behind bars where you belong the trump movement is awakening tens of millions of americans to the astonishing criminality of the democrats in washington theres an unstoppable movement rising up in america now that simply will not tolerate filthy democrats stealing our democracy and conning their way into power if they steal the election we will take to the streets and declare a clinton presidency illegitimate and illegal  we will stand behind the military men and women in uniform as the us armed forces depose you and remove you from office  to announce new elections without the festering cancerous stench of the dnc and the clintons hanging over this nation like a putrid cloud of filthwe the people have had enough of you demons you creatures from hell you walking bags of antihuman reptilian snakes who pretend to be leaders in washington

corruption and wretched government racketsfrom breitbartcom  racketeering former prosecutor andrew mccarthy has recently observed that hillary clintons abuse of the state department looks an awful lot like a racketeering enterprise which could trigger the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act of  more widely known as rico mccarthy explainedunder rico an enterprise can be any association of people informal or formal illegitimate or legitimate  it could be a mafia family an ostensibly charitable foundation or a department of government it is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through a pattern of racketeering activity a pattern means merely two or more violations of federal or state law these violations constitute racketeering activity if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute its time to defeat clinton  followed by arresting all the clinton operatives and initiating hundreds of federal prosecution cases against these third world fraudsters thats how we take back america restore democracy and regain public trust in law and order note to the feds arrest the democrat criminals or lose any semblance of legal authority in america remember if federal authorities do not arrest and prosecute the clintons and all their coconspirators they essentially forfeit any real claim to legitimate legal authority at that point the citizens will realize they no longer have any logical obligation to pay federal taxes obey federal laws abide by federal regulations or consent to be governed by anybody in washington at allafter all a nation run by a system that refuses to hold its leaders accountable for their criminal conduct is a nation that can no longer claim to operate under the rule of law at that point justice becomes a sad tragic joke against the citizens and the nation soon finds itself on the verge of a mass citizens revolt if the fbi wont seek criminal indictments against hillary

wednesday november   tags deep state  clinton cartel  damning evidence naturalnews my fellow americans we are watching history unfold before us with such sound and fury that we are likely to never witness comparable events again in our lifetime as of today i am now convinced that the deep state has turned on hillary clinton and will unveil damning evidence in the next few days that will end the clintons reign of terror over america and collapse her bid for the presidencythe mainstream media of course will never report this news for the simple reason that they are the propaganda arm of the criminal clinton cartel as such they will lie to the public to the bitter end even as the clinton titanic sinks with all of them on board in deep frigid waters no less with no more lifeboats to be foundthe socalled deep state  the powerful insiders who really run the intelligence services and inner layers of untouchable bureaucracy  has decided hillary clinton is too damaged to defend any longer  even if she were to win by stealing the election she would be so mired in criminal investigations and political illegitimacy that she would rip the nation to shreds while fighting for her own political survivalit has now been decided i believe that hillary clinton will be taken out of power by releasing criminally damaging emails which have long been held by the nsa and fbi this will likely happen before the coming weekend once that is accomplished the next goal will be to wait for president trump to take office then destroy the us economy through a controlled global debt collapse so that trump can be blamed for the near collapse of western economies remember the deep state isnt protrump theyre still all about defending the establishment but hillary is one bridge too far for even the statists to stomachinstead of allowing hillary clinton to take power and destroy america from the top in other words deep state power brokers have reverted to plan b which is to let trump take the white house then destroy america through the controlled demolition of its currency and economy this is simpler than it sounds bringing down the debt pyramid of a nation carrying nearly  trillion in national debt isnt exactly rocket science all they have to do is stand back and stop manipulating the markets and stop printing new money for a few months while raising interest rates monetary gravity will do the restin the mean time hillary clinton and a long list of her coconspirators are going to find themselves charged with obstruction of justice  lying under oath destruction of evidence conspiracy corruption and other serious charges that will lead to serious prison time for manythe criminal racket of the clintons is about to implode the participants will be charged under the rico act for racketeering activities for which ample evidence already exists a new video from steve pieczenik describes some of this in this video intelligence insider steve pieczenik lays out how highlevel intelligence insiders are now working in concert to reverse the clinton coup thats attempting to take over america and destroy it from withineven if you dont believe pieczenik  and i fully realize hes controversial in his own way  this short video is a very important must watch explanation to know what people in the intelligence community are doing weve initiated a countercoup the clintons are going to go full murder in a last ditch desperate effort to save themselves beware of what may yet unfold in the coming days like a cornered wild animal the clintons are extremely dangerous when they realize they have nothing to lose by going full murder in an attempt to save themselvesi will not be surprised the least bit if bodies of people in high places start piling up over the next week watch for news reports of mysterious car crashes swimming pool accidents or natural deaths involving people like james comey whod better have armed security personnel around him at all timeslook for desperate measures such as the clintons attempting to blackmail obama comey or anyone who they think might serve as leverage to save their own skins we might also see desperate false flag attacks unfold in the next few days although thats increasingly unlikely since it seems the clintons are now on their own they would need the assistance of obama to pull off another sandy hook you see a deal has already been struck with obama most likely deep state operatives have already struck a deal with obama to avoid prosecuting him for his own serious crimes as long as he stays out of the way as hillary clintons head is served up on a platter this likely explains why obama is now publicly saying he trusts comey and refuses to go to bat for hillary theres no love lost between obama and the clintons remember as all this is going down the propaganda ministry of the clinton regime  cnn nyt washington post etc  is going to explode into an allout batst crazy conspiracy theory phase where they blame the russians extraterrestrials bigfoot and the loch ness monster for everything thats imploding around the clintons mainstream media news reports are going to increasingly sound like sociopathic babble from crazy people grasping at whatever outlandish theories they can invoke maybe crop circles were created by the russians as a secret code to wikileaks and donald trump ehmeanwhile conspiratorial operatives like george stephanopoulos fully realize they are probably going to jail for collusion and sedition  so they have nothing left to lose by desperately trying to put hillary in the white house via any means at their disposal including totally faking negative news against donald trump which is of course the entire news mission of cnn at this point a disgraced propaganda network run by antiamerican traitors if the vote is stolen for hillary clinton all hell breaks loose should the globalist soros operators manage to steal the vote bribe the electoral voters or rig the black box voting machines sufficiently to place hillary clinton in the white house all hell breaks loose across america  the fbi goes into full indictment mode to push criminal charges for the clinton criminal regime donald trump launches a massive legal challenge to the election outcome dispatching an army of lawyers to level a vast assortment of charges involving coordinated voter fraud the rigging of voting machines the attempted bribery of electoral voters and so on the us military revs up its plans for an armed military coup to depose clinton and restore democracy this one should be especially entertaining to watch unfold if it gets activated and yes you will beg for a shortterm military dictatorship as long as they promise to depose clinton and restore open fair and free elections armed us citizens prepare for a massive march on washington to take back their democracy and restore a lawful society where the political elite dont get away with corruption fraud and murder expect this march to be joined by police officers and federal law enforcement officials of all kinds the nsa likely goes into full dump mode to unleash every scrap of damning criminal evidence against hillary clinton this will likely be joined by cia assets who already have the goods on the clintons and their lolita express pedo joy rides wikileaks anonymous and every former nsa analyst goes into destroy the clintons mode and begins to hack and expose every last shred of email evidence ever possessed by the clintons and anyone close to them anonymous alone has enough technical clout to accomplish this with little or no outside help i expect kim dotcom to be aiding this entire effort as well as he rightly holds extreme hatred toward hillary clinton as do we all come to think of it the establishment republicans in the us congress will as usual meekly surrender to the democrats pulls down their britches and bend over to prepare to take it in the rear because thats what they do best when the going gets tough totally useless politicrats like john mccain cant get their pants around their ankles quickly enough when democrats start accusing them of something these useless heaps of human baggage will be tossed out of washington as the revolution unfolds replaced with individuals who actually honor the us constitution like rep louie gohmert i root for all groups working to save america and expose the criminal politicians bring out the marshmallows and weiners folks this is going to be the most bizarre campfire front row seat to us history that anyone has witnessed in over  years try not to trip and face plant into the flames as all this unfolds it might be a smart idea to have some preparedness supplies at the ready since no one really knows just how nasty this is all going to get and thank god hillary doesnt have her fingers on the nuclear launch codes or shed probably launch them just to change the narrativeas for me im with anybody whos trying to save america  restore democracy and throw the establishment criminals in prison like almost everybody else ive had enough of the lies the corruption the media deceptions and the incessant blood sucking parasites in washington dc who are too arrogant and stupid to realize just how much theyre universally despised the revolution is on anonymous wikileaks project veritas the fbi and the nsa have all been activated theres no stopping them now and all the details of all the crimes of the clintons are about to spill onto the stage of history dirty deeds and allbe warned you are probably not

wednesday november   by j d heyes tags food poverty  hunger  obama administration naturalnews a democratic presidential nominee  hillary clinton who is by far the establishment candidate in this years presidential race  wants to take over from another democratic president barack obama she is promising to carry on his successful economic policies by promising to essentially double down on them and yet by any true measure the economy has been a disaster under obama real growth has nearly flatlined  real unemployment figures  when a proper count is taken  is far higher than what is being officially posted by the administration  and  million americans cannot get enough food without government assistancein fact on that last point and as reported by natural blaze  in the obama economy in americans are going to bed hungry on most nights if not every nightand clinton wants to double down on obamas economic policies how can such a great economic recovery produce so many hungry americans for the past eight years americans have had to listen to lectures from obama and other democrats about how we as a firstworld nation should be able to afford things like healthcare and offer a free college education to our citizens and increasingly to noncitizens  but shouldnt a nation that produces so much excess food each year that we export it to the tune of tens of billions of dollars be able to feed its people tooof course but malnutrition during the great economic recovery of the obama years is rising at an alarming rate in the us thats because in real terms workers wages are falling and it is becoming more difficult for families and individuals to earn enough to put decent food on their tablesfor many particularly the low paid sic this means two things fuel and food poverty  natural blaze reportedlow salaries combined with stagnant wages jobs going to illegal immigrants and parttime work rising as obamacare forces fewer companies to retain fulltime employees mean that food is increasingly seen as a luxury and of those who can still afford food many have to settle for cheap nutritionpoor junk foods and foods high in starches carbohydrates and calories now winter approaches and with it the inevitable supply challenges of natural gas and heating oil which traditionally produce higher pricesbut the establishment media is part of the problem for example in february bloomberg reported that in americans were on food stamps despite an economic recovery  no one should ever be hungry in america unless they choose to be what recovery obamas economy is growing at about  percent a quarter  far below what is needed to sustain economic growth to the extent that it would lower our debt and provide wellpaying jobs to the tens of millions needing themso the caveat is disingenuous a more accurate story would have reflected on the in figure as it pertained to a real lack of opportunity among americans to find better employment opportunities in fact the story makes no sense when you analyze it either the economy is really good and a in ratio is no big deal or the ratio is a big deal because the socalled economic recovery isnt reaching enough people which is itits the latter of course and while america will always have a portion of the population that is too sick too old or too lazy to produce  and they will be a net drain on the treasury  the goal of any administration ought to be to adopt sound financial policies or to rescind policies that serve as impediments to economic growth in todays america that generally means thinning out the massive bureaucracy that is not only robbing millions of a better life because of their negative impact on business and industry but is actually causing them to go hungryand that should never happen in america so why is it sources",2016-10-29

eric associated press reporter says he knows its true but will gladly print that its false 
whats truly astonishing in this email is how ap reporter eric tucker says he will gladly lie to cover for the clintons  in plain english he explains that he has solid reason to believe the report about the thumb drive but he will gladly publish a false narrative via the associated press  and he even suggests what that false narrative should be if you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed then i would gladly accept that as well 
in other words hes not just corrupt dishonest and fraudulent as a journalist hes also suggesting the false narrative the clintons should use

the new world order might seem a bit farfetched for many a handful of powerful people acting as puppet masters for the human race is a thought that might not even cross the minds of many that have seamlessly adapted to the beliefs that were instilled in them from a young age the thought that we are all being controlled and enslaved by the banks with the aid of the government is for conspiracy theorists there is no doubt that there are negative connotations associated with being a conspiracy theorist that belief has been reiterated many times mostly from the mainstream media there are people who see the world for what they are told it is others see whats really going on behind the curtain the stranglehold the global elite have on money and knowledge makes them very powerful they either directly or indirectly control every aspect of our lives 
global megacorporations make up to billions of dollars on an annual basis a select few at the top of the company make absurd amounts of money while the employees making the difference and driving the company forward are barely paid enough money to stay afloat if humans stay busy working  weekly hours for very little income they wont have the time or the resources to realize they have been dealt a bad hand the top  percent doesnt want americans to be any more educated then to have the ability to help operate and patronize their business 
the global elite have a system in place which allows them to grow their global banking empire all of humanity are literally slaves to the economic system money is necessary for our survival in the real world today most people will spend the majority of their time working just to survive in the system if money is the god of our time that makes rothschild his prophet public school programs worldwide are where the global elite first begin to shape our minds they continue the shaping through the media we are taught what they want us to know and nothing more 
the rich continue to get richer by purchasing up many successful smaller businesses when the top  percent owns the majority of banks resources and even our governments it means big problems for the people the rothschilds are worth over  trillion and they are just  of  families that pretty much collectively own the world the rothschilds alone could pay off the us national debt  times over unfortunately they would never do such a thing because they own the majority of the worlds central banks the new world orders agenda is slowly taking small steps toward complete and definitive enslavement through use of the monetary system and ownership of resources

corruption bribery death all three are examined in various news reports on a little known specialty pharmaceutical company called insys theraputics they are currently under legal fire for subsys a controversial sublingual spray that disperses fentanyl a very fast acting opioid that is  times more potent than morphine the under the tongue delivery allows the fentanyl to bypass the gastrointestinal system and deliver the opioid directly into the blood stream the federal drug administration fda has ruled that subsys can only be prescribed to help cancer patients gain relief from sudden spikes of excruciating pain 
sarah fuller was a  year old woman who suffered from anxiety and fibromyalgia  she didnt have cancer but that didnt stop her doctor from prescribing subsys for her aches and pains the fentanyl acted quickly with sarahs already prescribed xanax a benzodiazepine she died her family is suing the manufacturer but why did sarahs doctor prescribe a drug that wasnt approved thats easy to answer just follow the money 
as stat reports the sales of subsys grew to  million precisely because physicians give it to patients that dont have cancer like sarah fuller doctors get big dollars to simply talk about the drug over dinner or lunch over  million dollars have been paid to doctors and health practitioners for this word of mouth activity 
take the example of nurse practitioner heather alfonso from illinois she was paid  to go to dinner with a few people and in response prescribed  million dollars of subsys scripts to patients that werent suffering with cancer pain she didnt contest the allegations against her 
getting paid to speak isnt automatically a bribe but it appears to be a consistent theme when it comes to susbys marketing methods alabama prosecutors built a case against nancy reed perhacs who used to be a sales representative for insys theraputics ms perhacs coordinated speaking fees for a doctor friend provided he prescribed subsys her take was  other investigations about similar practices are ongoing in kansas rhode island new york oregon michigan florida and new hampshire 
the chief executive founder and chairman of insys theraputics is billionaire john kapoor hes been around the block with other controversial pharmaceutical start ups kapoor thinks doctors are all ethical his new fda approved drug is a chemically created synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol thc called syndros as states legalize the real medicine in cannabis  thc and cbd oil  this is an important pharmaceutical to boycott

the new york times publisher and executive editor have promised to rededicate the paper to its fundamental mission  to report america and the world honestly without favors and fear the paper claims they will strive to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences in stories brought to the public this announcement is almost considered an apology to its readers for providing a year and a half of unbalanced and unhinged coverage of the presidential race 
sean hannity suggests that trump must ignore the media and trust his gut instincts he was sad to see the yearold paper destroy their credibility over the election season it was obvious to dedicated readers that the times had abandoned its old coverage standards stories were unrelentingly hostile towards trump and his supporters reporters were including their personal opinions and political analysis in the news coverage this allowed animosity toward trump to be spread all over social media by political reporters front page stories on the new york times were accusing trump of lying but the paper never published the same findings in reference to hillary clinton  the papers liberal readership has even gotten tired of reporting that resembles state controlled propaganda of totalitarian regimes newt gingrich destroys the new york times credibility with seven simple questions 
the new york times has struggled mightily to answer some serious questions posed by the former united states house of representatives speaker gingrich a republican has asked the times whether they have any reporters editors or columnists that will say they voted for trump he elaborated to ask if they have since hired any trump supporters to work those positions for the times the paper struggled to say whether or not it has hired any republican reporters at all 
gingrich has also asked if the new york times has changed its policies allowing journalists to express their opinions about events and people they are covering the fourth question asked by gingrich wondered if the times reporters would surrender any pulitzer prizes awarded for news stories containing personal opinions here are the final questions that the times struggled to address have its editors retracted misleading news headlines that expressed opinions  such as the papers coverage of trumps tax returns has it fired reporters who admitted to writing politically motivated news stories and encouraged interview subjects to talk to them so they could stop trump has it retracted its shameful electioneve frontpage story reporting on trumps innermost thoughts and feelings virtually every sentence of which is filled with reporters opinions and speculationsfeaturing claims like he is struggling to suppress his bottomless need for attention

hillary clinton could probably spend  hours a day for the rest of the campaign doing nothing but targeting trumps hypocrisies 
while trump was trying to drum up business for his struggling new dc hotel hillary clinton was winning more early votes in the state of florida there are two competing messages in the media currently about the election the first message is that democrats are blowing out republicans in early voting the second message is that a few state polls have shown trump leading by a little in florida and gaining ground in new hampshire 
it is possible that both of these stories are correct democrats are blowing out republicans in early voting and with no new sex assault stories dominating the news some republicans may be coming back to trump 
the important thing for hillary clinton and democrats is not to let up democrats are very close to generation defining win but victory is not sealed yet more polling will need to be done to see if the two state polls were outliers or if this is a trend but the polls may not matter 
if most of the ballots in states like north carolina and florida are cast before election day the polls may end up meaning very little 
hillary clinton is in a great position but judging from her own remarks she is still working hard to close the deal on november

the apgfk poll has hillary clinton leading donald trump by  points nationally  the apgfk poll finds that clinton has secured the support of  percent of likely democratic voters and also has the backing of  percent of more moderate republicans just  percent of all republicans surveyed say they are voting for their partys nominee 
earlier in the day two bloomberg polls that had trump leading florida by  points and cutting clintons new hampshire lead in half gave republicans a bit of hope that the presidential election might be tightening but the reality is that voting is already underway in  states there are very few undecided voters remaining 
outside of tracking polls donald trump hasnt had a polling lead since july  besides his brief july bump trump hasnt led clinton in national polling since may what the media and republicans dont want to tell you is that this presidential election has been remarkably consistent 
there is nothing in the polling to suggest that the election is tightening or that trump has significantly improved his odds of winning 
those who are looking for a tightening in the polls should keep dreaming because right now its not happening",2016-10-31
1072,mutiny at the fbi comey warned by his own agents to indict clinton,"by sean colarossi on wed oct th  at  pm this type of language from someone who used to be a member of the united states congress is abhorrent but its also to be expected in the trump era of american politics share on twitter print this post 
hopefully as a country well return to a time in our politics when violent language is shocking and rare but this year when the man at the top of the republican ticket has repeatedly encouraged his supporters to revolt if he loses isnt likely to be that time 
on wednesday former gop congressman joe walsh a rightwing extremist who now hosts a talk radio show followed his nominees lead and told urged his twitter followers to grab their guns on nov  if hillary clinton is elected

on november th if trump loses im grabbing my musket 
you in 
 joe walsh walshfreedom october   
this type of language from someone who used to be  and thankfully no longer is  a member of the united states congress is abhorrent but its also to be expected in the trump era of american politics 
after all not long ago trump himself instructed his supporters to revolt if clinton decides to fulfill her constitutional duty and nominate supreme court judges 
if she gets to pick her judges nothing you can do folks the republican nominee said although the second amendment people  maybe there is i dont know 
more recently trump said that hed like to see what happens if clintons bodyguards were disarmed 
i think her bodyguards should drop all weapons disarm immediately he said take their guns away lets see what happens to her 
not only does walshs rhetoric align perfectly with what trump has suggested at various points throughout this campaign but its also a continuation of dangerous language that the former republican congressman seems to enjoy using 
earlier in the year when five police officers were gunned down in dallas walsh blamed president obama tweeting this is now war watch out obama watch out black lives matter punks real america is coming after you 
before trump hit the scene this type of rhetoric existed but it often only came from the most extreme elements in either party now it has the encouragement of a major party presidential nominee

1073,dilbert creator scott adams endorses trump says hillary is a bully,"by sean colarossi on wed oct th  at  pm not even an overwhelming victory by hillary clinton is likely to convince republicans that they should do their job share on twitter print this post 
since republicans have essentially conceded that donald trump is going to lose the general election to hillary clinton theyre already making plans in the event that she decides to do her job and nominate supreme court justices 
according to a report from the huffington post on wednesday one conservative thinker says that john mccains recent suggestion that his party should block any nominee put forward by clinton isnt that farfetched 
the report 
some conservatives certainly seem to be warming up to mccains controversial suggestion last week that senate republicans should dig in their heels and block any and all supreme court nominees put forth by a future president hillary clinton 
who needs a fully functioning supreme court after all 
as a matter of constitutional law the senate is fully within its powers to let the supreme court die out literally wrote the cato institutes ilya shapiro in a column wednesday on the federalist 
shapiro is wellversed in constitutional issues and his argument has a legal if contorted basis nothing in the constitution explicitly stands in the way of senators who would be willing to destroy the nations highest court  if not an entire branch of the federal government  to stop clinton from selecting judges who share her views 
 
to shapiro theres nothing wrong with even more senate obstructionism because the constitution is completely silent on how the upper chamber provides its advice and consent on the presidents nominees 
 
so when you get past the gotcha headlines breathless reportage and inauguration day if hillary clinton is president it would be completely decent honorable and in keeping with the senates constitutional duty to vote against essentially every judicial nominee she names he concluded 
the original argument from republicans was that they would block president obamas supreme court appointment until voters had a chance to weigh in via the nov  election forget the fact that this isnt how the constitutional system is meant to operate but that was their reasoning 
now faced with the growing prospect that hillary clinton will be elected the th president of the united states they are beginning to change their tune 
the obstruction that defined the republican party throughout obamas presidency looks like it will be sticking around after he is gone its yet another reason why downballot races are more critical than ever this year",2016-10-31

ever since donald trump was lambasted by leaders in both parties for fighting with a gold star family and dishonoring the service of captain humayun khan hes been trying out a new approach pretending khan would still be alive if he was president 
khan was killed in  in a suicide attack in iraq 
when the republican was asked in an interview with abcs george stephanopoulos if he thinks he should apologize for the way he treated the khan family following the democratic national convention he repeated this bogus claim

 abc news politics abcpolitics october   
trump said i have great respect for the khan family i have great respect for  i mean their son is a great hero  but if i were president at that time capt khan would be alive today george because i wouldnt have been in iraq  i was opposed to the war in iraq 
as hillary clinton and many objective sources have noted repeatedly throughout the campaign donald trump was not opposed to the war in iraq from the beginning had he been president at the time the war still would have taken place because trump was in favor of it 
in fact trumps campaign rhetoric today indicates that he would be a president who acts recklessly and would only embolden our enemies this would make the world a more dangerous place and only increase the odds that america gets mired in more conflicts not less 
for their part the clinton campaign has continued to stand up to trumps attacks on the khan family in an emotional new ad released days ago capt khans father recounts how his son died protecting everyone in his unit khans father asked of trump would my son have a place in your america 
the answer to mr khans question is a resounding no as trump has promised to ban muslims  like the khans  from even entering the united states for those living here already a president trump would treat them like criminals 
donald trump will likely continue to rewrite history when it comes to his initial support of military intervention in iraq but after spending so much time throwing mud at the khan family its unlikely that anybody will buy it",2016-10-31
1077,why i am a homesteader and why you should be to,"the washington post reported  
the democratic national committee has filed papers in federal court against the republican national committee accusing it of violating a  court order intended to prevent voter intimidation 
the motion filed in new jersey says the rnc has supported the efforts of presidential candidate donald trumps campaign to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the  presidential election trump has recently been urging his supporters to monitor polling places on election day 
democrats arent going to stand by and let trump supporters waltz into polling places in heavily democratic areas to intimidate voters 
trumps call for his supporters to go to polling places that arent their own to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree 
the republican party which has completely abandoned the idea of winning elections based on ideas is firmly standing behind their nominee because the same party that was too weak to stop trump during the primary is certainly not going to stand in the way of what might be their only chance of winning 
people should not be afraid to go to the polls and vote no matter who you are voting for democrats have your back the republican party has been trying to suppress the vote and intimidate voters for years

so donald trump has responded to hillary clintons accusation that he used undocumented workers to build his new dc hotel a room luxury hotel just blocks from the white house trump claims he used no undocumented workers  and as we saw earlier  oh yeah hillary clinton sleeps three days at a time 
trumps decision to attend the grand opening rather than campaign raised many eyebrows not just in the clinton camp republican strategist steve schmidt told msnbc 
he is not doing any of the normal activities that youd be doing  days out in a presidential race for somebody whos competitive you dont take a timeout to tend to your business interests 
as libby nelson wrote at vox  clinton is making her closing argument trump is making infomercials 
all this seems to have stung the thinskinned trump who previously set aside his campaign to open a golf course in scotland as cbs news sopan deb tweets  trumps defense was a little odd to say the least trumps riff on his hotel is worth your time to read denies ever using undocumented immigrants and says clinton sleeps for  days at a time pictwittercomrlsbebzky 
 sopan deb sopandeb october   
the republican nominee protested to cnns dana bash  for you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because hillary clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps it is literally impossible for trump to hear criticism without responding by attacking somebody else 
trumps defense reveals a man who is overly sensitive to criticism he works all the time while clinton sleeps for three days he says he took an hour off it was a bit more than that to open his new hotel while she wants to sleep all the time 
he says clinton gives one speech and then sleeps for three days in fact clinton made two get out the vote stops in florida yesterday she makes an appearance with the president and first lady today in north carolina and has two appearances scheduled in iowa for the day after 
and trumps heated denial of using undocumented workers is unconvincing considering his track record in that regard 
it is a fact as hillary clinton said yesterday that donald trump once again used undocumented labor to build a hotel he used undocumented labor to build trump tower  and the washington post reports that trumps new downtown dc hotel was built thanks to the efforts of a large workforce that included hispanic construction workers including some workers who say they are undocumented  said one worker in  the majority of us are hispanics many who came illegally 
the old saw about the man who protests too much comes to mind in reading trumps denial this is a man who has a history of exploiting undocumented immigrants and according to the workers themselves this remains true 
nonsensical talk about his opponent sleeping for three days straight is pure deflection and it wont work trump already has his clothing lines made in china mexico and elsewhere and he has used undocumented labor even while railing against the loss of american jobs 
trump is a hypocrite and hissy fits and deflection are no answer to the allegations against him and certainly no recommendation for the office of president",2016-10-31
1079,treat kidney infection with these home remedies,"by rmuse on thu oct th  at  am to avoid climateending global temperature rise it is critical for the world to transition off fossil fuels and embrace renewable clean energy sources share on twitter print this post the following is an opinion column by r muse 
over the past few months there has been a dearth of good news and if there did happen to be anything good to report it was overshadowed by the national clown show that is a typical american election where there has not been one iota of good news is on climate change even dismissing the horrible flooding wildfires droughts sea level rise melting ice caps hurricanes and worldwide food shortages there have only been dire reports on the level of co permeating the atmosphere and the subsequent yearly recordsetting rise in global temperatures 
this week while most americans were living breathing and bleeding over donald trump and the tortuouslylong presidential campaign the international energy agency offered up some good news for the climate the earths population and even for america 
the good news for the planet came in the form of an announcement on tuesday by the international energy agency iea that stated according to new data for the first time renewable energy sources have passed coal as the largest new source of electricity in the world 
it may not seem like such fantastic news but climate scientists the world over have warned that if human beings are going to avoid that climateending degree c rise in global temperatures it is critical for the world to transition off of carbonproducing fossil fuels and embrace renewable clean energy generating sources this is particularly true for getting off dirty coalfired electrical generation plants that are responsible for a quarter of americas c emissions carbon dioxide emissions are one of the main culprits contributing to climate change driven by global warming 
the iea report revealed that solar and wind account for nearly twothirds of current renewable energy growth and interestingly those increases are occurring in and coming from developing and industrialized nations alike for a developing nation it makes perfect sense to embrace cheaper renewable energy as opposed to any fossil fuelgenerated power sources whether they are dirty coalfired plants or notquiteasdirty natural gasburning generating plants 
the iea also revised its earlier projections for renewable energys continued expansion and growth and  significantly increased the amount of  green energy  it expects to  come on line  over the next five years renewable energy includes socalled green sources such as biomass biogas eligible biomass and small hydroelectric sources according to the environmental protection agency epa both terms renewable and green energy include solar and wind generating sources and depending on the context they can be interchangeable 
in addition to prorenewable policies such as the paris climate agreement and to a lesser extent the americachina deal to roll back coalgenerated emissions there has been a significant price decline that is helping drive the growth in renewables particularly in solar and the iea projected that the worldwide costs for solargenerated power will continue declining by an additional  percent over the next five years onshore wind generated electricity costs will drop by at least another  percent during that same fiveyear period 
although the iea report was incredibly good news for the entire planet there was some extra good news in the report about americas transition to renewable energy according to the ieas mediumterm renewable market report the united states is adding renewables at a faster rate than demand is growing what that means for the climate is that renewables are not only covering the everincreasing demand for electricity but are now supplanting some fossil fuel electricity still america has a long way to go because wind and solar generating sources make up a small portion of americas electricity 
in time and if the koch brothers allow it america may catch up to stilldeveloping nations where renewable energy accounts for about half of new electric power sources industrialization is fueling a rapid increase in demand for electricity that is best generated with cheaper renewable energy 
although there appears to be no downside in this bit of good news the growth of renewable energy does have economic implications the dirty coal industry is facing some struggles?in part due to the glut of oil and lower national gas prices financial mismanagement and new cleanair regulations but the amount of co driving climate change is a testament that they have had a good long reign in providing dirty fuel to generate electricity it is noteworthy that as coal jobs may be declining the solar industry is growing and thriving to more than take up the slack in any lost coal jobs 
the iea couldnt pass up the chance to note one sticking point in their otherwise encouraging report  persistent challenges of heating and transportation energy  that renewables are not affecting however since the iea only monitored and tracked the worlds transistor from oil and gas to biofuels they note that as electric and hybrid vehicles continue to increase around the world they will be connected to the same electrical grid that is steadily getting a little greener significantly cheaper and one hell of a lot more friendly for the climate and the people 
it is a mystery how republicans beholden to the koch brothers and dirty fossil fuel industry particularly the dirty coal industry will absorb this good news in the past eight years republicans  the kochs their lobbyists at the heritage foundation americans for prosperity and the american legislative exchange council alec have made killing renewable energy one of their primary goals it is likely that the ieas report will signal they are not winning the war on renewable energy and in the past that may have been worrisome but now that more americans are benefitting from renewable energy particularly solar republicans will have a difficult time convincing them to stop getting free electricity from the sun and saving the climate for their childrens future something the ieas report never mentions

to compensate for this trumps campaign has devised another strategy which not surprisingly is negative instead of expanding the electorate bannon and his team are trying to shrink it we have three major voter suppression operations under way says a senior official theyre aimed at three groups clinton needs to win overwhelmingly idealistic white liberals young women and african americans trumps invocation at the debate of clintons wikileaks emails and support for the transpacific partnership was designed to turn off sanders supporters the parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by bill clinton and harassed or threatened by hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women and her  suggestion that some african american males are super predators is the basis of a belowtheradar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the pollsparticularly in florida 
the effort was obvious and according to the polling it is failing 
voter turnout among young women is expected to rise according to the latest harvard iop young voters poll sanders started flocking towards clinton in august  and havent left and early voting statistics show that africanamerican turnout is solid in swing states 
the trump campaign has realized that they dont have enough supporters to win so they are adopting tactics that run contrary to the heart of democracy to shrink the electorate in critical states 
however for voter suppression efforts like trumps to be effective the campaign must have a credible messenger donald trump is not a credible messenger to any of the voters that he is trying to deter and he has no effective surrogates that are capable of delivering his message 
a voter suppression effort was expected from the trump campaign what is unexpected is that the campaign would publicly brag about it 
people on all sides of the political spectrum who care about basic democratic institutions should be alarmed by trumps public attack on democracy 
the good news for all americans is that democrats are already fighting back  and the trump campaigns dark efforts to steal an election appear to be failing",2016-10-31

if democrats pick up  house seats or more speaker ryan is going to have a major problem because his job will be in jeopardy politico reported that ryans enemies in the house freedom caucus are divided over whether or not to support him 
conservative house republicans are plotting with one another and openly pining for ryans ouster because he refuses to change the house rules to all more conservative legislation to be passed the hill is also reporting that conservativehouse republicans are deeply divided on keeping ryan but donald trump could be the wild card that mobilizing an opposition effort to the speaker the businessman has repeatedly criticized ryans leadership and was stung after the speaker said he would not longer defend trump after a  tape emerged in which the gop nominee speaks lewdly about groping and kissing women win or lose on nov  trump could put pressure on house republicans to oppose ryan in a speakership contest 
ryan is certain to be leading a smaller house majority in january the size of trumps defeat on election day will help decide how many seats republicans lose 
eight of the nine house republicans who cast votes against ryan for speaker initially will still be around to vote against him again in january 
those close to ryan say that he would step down as speaker before getting into a protracted fight with his own party but the walls are closing in on speaker ryan

1082,how to heal hemorrhoids fast,"at a donald trump rally in north carolina a proud ginger glover waved a lyin hillary doll with a special edition noose on it 
watch a clip with glover at the wednesday rally here via nbc news  
glover said the noose was her way of making a point that hillary clinton should be incarcerated at the very least but when asked said she doesnt think clinton should be killed 
yet her employees put the noose on the doll for her and she brought it out in public and waved it around for effect 
where is all of the trump rallies violent rhetoric and imagery going 
donald trump seems to attract people who are angry and want someone to blame 
the washington post did an incredible story on melanie austin a trump supporter who said trump sees the world like she does she realized this days after she had been injected with something intended to calm her after she was involuntarily committed for homicidal ideation against president obama 
the first time she had seen him at a rally in june she was just beginning to realize how many people saw the world the way she did that she was one among millions at the time her hips were still sore from a series of injections intended to calm her she had gotten them in february during a difficult time in her life when she had been involuntarily hospitalized for several weeks after what she called a rant a series of online postings that included one saying that obama should be hanged and the white house fumigated and burned to the ground on her discharge papers in a box labeled medical problem a doctor had typed homicidal ideation 
donald trump and the altright and indeed way too many elected republicans have already pointed these folks at hillary clinton and barack obama as evil people who must be harmed when you attract unstable people who are easily manipulated out of anger and fear and then direct them to harm someone as trump and his advisers have done suggesting hillary clinton might be shot and saying she should be executed with a firing squad you are responsible for inciting violence 
things are not going well for trump supporters and even buoyed as they are with unscientific online polls and delusions fed by the altright media and fox news they smell defeat 
perhaps thats not connected to this specific woman who brought a hillary clinton doll in a noose to wave at a trump rally last night but it is a trend were seeing in general  angry trump fans using more and more violent rhetoric 
there will be more of this not less as trumps likely defeat becomes reality outside of tinfoil circles 
this is political intimidation that mimics donald trumps despotic promises to jail clinton even though shes been cleared of wrongdoing in all of the relentless republican investigations into her activities as secretary of state 
of which there will be plenty more republicans promise us should she win  because just like the trump camp doesnt want you to vote republicans only want government to work when theyre not in power 
the potent mixture of tinfoil and rage is creating a toxic brew of violent fantasies and rhetoric among trump supporters

before the show we were photographed outside the building laaksonen is quoted by haaretz  trump stood next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt he really grabbed my butt i dont think anybody saw it but i flinched and thought what is happening 
as to the veracity of these claims it should be noted that laaksonen didnt seek the tabloid out iltasanomat the second largest paper in the country according to wikipedia  reached out to finnish women who had encountered trump and thats how they discovered her story 
in case youre not already grimacing the former miss finland added somebody told me there that trump liked me because i looked like melania when she was younger 
trump has been caught on tape saying women expire at the age of  melania trump is now  so she would have been expired when this alleged groping incident took place in

donald trump is on tape bragging about grabbing women by their pssy against their will so its not a stretch to hear that he did indeed do this to women who are also willing to come forward and face the wrath of the trump machine 
what should be alarming is that donald trump is the best of the best on the republican bench i mean that is supposed to be how this works right a group of top contenders are picked for possible nomination and the best gets it 
republicans try to say this is just locker room talk but if then senator barack obama had had a bus tape like trumps let alone  women accusing him of doing what he bragged about doing he not only wouldnt be in office right now  he wouldnt have been a contender rightfully so",2016-10-31

the trump campaign has gone as far as to admit that if they lose florida they will lose the election but the signs are evident in the polling that the republican party is much closer to experiencing a landslide than they are to winning the white house in november 
a trump landslide defeat could trigger a disaster for republicans that leads to additional democratic senate pickups beyond the four seats needed to take back the majority republicans could see their current record house majority gutted in a clinton landslide 
the election is not getting better for republicans the landscape is getting worse if this polling continues for another week at the state level democrats could be looking at their best case scenario of a democratic white house house and senate being in play",2016-11-01

the retiring senate democratic leader has been loudly urging democrats to spend big in florida to end rubios national political career 
according to harry enten at fivethirtyeight  the polling suggests that pulling out of florida is probably the right move for democrats but with cash to burn and a shot to beat rubio there is a case to be made for more spending

it was a standard day in the life of donald trumps presidential campaign as the republican nominee spent much of his time on the campaign trail thursday making outrageous and insulting comments 
this was on clear display at a rally in toledo ohio when trump proposed one of his most ridiculous ideas yet cancel the election and just anoint him president

 bradd jaffy braddjaffy october   
im just thinking to myself right now we should just cancel the election and just give it to trump right trump asked the crowd what are we even having it for  her policies are so bad 
despite trumps plea to cancel the election as he continues to struggle in the polls it will be the voters who decide which candidate has the better policies  thankfully 
the remark also aligns closely with other recent comments in which trump claimed the process is rigged against him and he will only accept the outcome of the election if its favorable for him 
but trump wasnt done at his buckeye state rally he also made sure to take a dig at minority communities

were gonna work on our ghettos  take a look at whats going on where you have pockets of areas of land where you have the inner cities and you have so many things so many problems so many horrible horrible problems  the violence the death the lack of education no jobs were gonna work with the africanamerican community and were going to solve the problem of the inner city  you cant walk out the street you buy a loaf of bread and you end up getting shot 
the republican nominees ghetto comment is the newest addition to what is the standard trump narrative that black communities are hellscapes this particular set of remarks comes a day after he visited north carolina for a rally and told supporters  mostly white  that he would enact a new deal for black america

she is hardly alone and more and more evangelical women are joining the ranks of those who have heard enough misogyny from trump the reaction of evangelical women as laurie goodstein noted at the new york times earlier this month be a rift that shapes politics for years 
it isnt as if trump hasnt been saying these things all along as david french protested at the national review back in june trump subverts all of our most cherished values the question is what took them so long 
trump has already had an effect on the religious right an unrepentant sinner who represents everything they claim to oppose he has  percent support from evangelical men but while evangelical women seem to support him despite his misogyny there are good reasons to suspect the men support him because of his negative attitude towards women

while trump appears not to understand basic military activities its not clear to me that hes interested in learning them either because there are a number of experts who i thinkwould advise him otherwise but he seems to be confident in his knowledge and that knowledge i think reveals a lot about what he doesnt know 
 
this kind of rhetoric this kind of disrespect for our military leadership this absence of support for our troops who are actually in combat and support for our allies who are fighting and dying every day  it means to me that this individual is not qualified to be commanderinchief 
military experts like gen allen feel compelled to criticize the republican nominee days before a presidential election because they feel like he is not supporting the troops and would be a danger to national security as commander in chief 
thanks to donald trump the republican party has become the party that doesnt support the troops 
republicans have gone from real america to unamerican in record time

from june  through september  the trump campaign meaning donald trump spent m on hats according to fec filings  they spent just m on polling unsurprisingly they are behind on polling leading in precisely zero  polls  you want to win an election you need sweet hats abraham lincoln 
trump has spent more on hats than direct mail or polling pictwittercomtofdqmq

and the washington post is reporting that in the first  days of october trump only raised half as much as clinton according to campaign finance reports his biggest day was the  million he brought in on the day his sex assault tape was released which tells you all you need to know about his base 
remember when trump claimed he would give m of his own money to his campaign yeah this is a guy who wont even buy his own autographed sports memorabilia he uses other peoples money for that with the election just  days away he has only donated m 
make what you will of this but he had been giving m a month to his campaign in the first  days of october just k in inkind contributions thats right even trump wont invest in his own campaign at this point 
trump pulled in m up to october  down from m in september meanwhile the clinton campaign has pulled in a cool m in that same period she spent less than normal m but that leaves her a war chest of m going into the final stretch 
donald trump says he is a great businessman yet he has spent twice as much on collateral including hats as he has on paying his staff he says he gets only the best people and he bought a lot of his maga hats his campaign site only sells  different styles of hat at  to  apiece 
and according to huffington post  the october  federal election commission filing for trump make america great again committee shows trump spent k of donors money to buy his own book  presumably the art of the deal he profited personally by doing this by way of royalty payments and then turned around and resold autographed copies of the  book at  each 
his campaign pays him to rent his own campaign headquarters yet trump told a crowd in geneva ohio that hillary clinton has never earned an honest dollar well i think thats really you know 
trump is probably the first presidential nominee to try to win the white house while turning a personal profit

it is a cruel reality of american electoral politics that the losers of presidential campaigns get banished from national discourse and that process has already begun for donald trump 
despite the fact that trump has been claiming that the presidential election is going to be rigged stolen or unfair his cries are beginning to fall on deaf ears the latest washington post tracking poll found that confidence that votes will be counted correctly grew by  points from  the number of respondents who believed that voter fraud occurs somewhat often has dropped from  and those expressing concerns that all votes will be counted accurately dropped from  to  even trump supporters are split  on whether or not votes will be counted accurately 
part of the shift is likely due to the effective job that president obama did in addressing these concerns but it is most likely that voters are treating trump like the candidate who is going to lose the election 
one of the best indicators of a presidential elections outcome as election day draws near is the question of who voters think will win 
hillary clinton is dominant on the question of who voters believe will win the election which is a hint of the way that people are voting 
the process of tuning out the losing candidate has a long history in the us two party system losing candidates who refuse to go away like sarah palin are viewed as annoying relics who refuse to acknowledge that their time is up

the gop presidential nominee had just  million left in his campaign coffers on oct  compared to hillary clintons  million when the cash reserves of their joint fundraising committees are included clintons war chest grew to  million while trumps totaled  million 
trumps total fundraising dropped  in the first  days of october  million is close to nothing for a national presidential campaign in the closing weeks of the race at a time when trump needs boots on the ground to get out the republican vote his presidential campaign is broke and in debt to the tune of  million there isnt going to be a lastminute ad blitz for trump or a reservation of television time so that the republican nominee can speak directly to voters before election day 
the plan for trump is for the campaign to continue to limp along with lots of rallies which are good for trumps ego but not effective in getting voters to the polls trump promised to donate  million to his campaign but has only given  million  the billionaire who promised to selffinance has run his presidential campaign into the ground trump took ten times more money out of his campaign in reimbursements to his own businesses than he gave in october 
fundraising is an indicator of expected election outcomes the money tends to go towards the winner at the end of an election hillary clinton is having no trouble raising money which suggests that enthusiasm is high among her supporters trumps cash crush points to a depressed base that doesnt expect him to win

the point is that hillary clintons emails arent a big issue to the majority of voters the people who arent republicans in this election dont care about her emails 
when compared to trump sexually assaulting women not paying federal income taxes and being sued in two states for fraud the emails seem like a quaint political scandal from a much simpler time

ive never heard anybody in this campaign talk that way frankly you know it was offensive to me to hear that being reported in the news because thats just not the approach donald trump has taken to this campaign its not the approach were taking were reaching out to every american 
pence then claimed independents and even democrats are breaking for trump in fact trump and pence are even losing groups that voted for mitt romney in  pence then belied his own confidence by trying to shame republicans into voting for them by saying its time for republicans to come home because trump won the primary 
mike pence laughed at the idea that the race is over and done because its just not what i see out there 
trump also loves to cite what he sees and reads and often times those things turn out to not even exist  like videos he claims to have watched 
this explains why mike pence and donald trump ended up together it turns out they are not that different after all in spite of the republican establishments efforts to persuade the voters and themselves otherwise both pence and trump dont care a whit about facts this is more than typical campaign spin its appalling in context 
the context is that mike pence is willingly standing next to a man who brags about grabbing a womans pssy without her permission but he is publicly saying hes offended by language used in a report about their voter suppression efforts 
pence didnt even bother to read the article which suggests that he doesnt care if their campaign is really suppressing voters but why would he 
pence didnt care about any of the groups donald trump insulted  not enough to take a public stand so why start now but he took a public stand was when the insult was aimed at his own campaign

facts wont stop republicans from trying to make something out of nothing but the comey letter is not the campaign changer that trump and the republicans were hoping for the weakness of this story means that should play well in the conservative media echo chamber but by monday it will be forgotten by the rest of the country",2016-11-01

donald trumps message that everything in the us is crap and we are all drowning in economic hardship that only trump can fix got slapped down today as the us economy roars back 
the advance estimate of gdp for the third quarter of  showed that the obama economy grew at an annual rate of  the conservative wall street journal headlined this news with us economy roars back grew  in third quarter 
jason furman chairman of the council of economic advisers summarized the numbers real gdp grew  percent at an annual rate in the third quarter with strong export growth and continued strength in consumer spending 
this news flies in the face of donald trumps basic economic message of doom and gloom that only he can fix the trump economic plan creates at least  million jobs boosts growth up to  percent and is revenue neutral trumps website claims 
before these numbers trumps previous problem was that trumps economic plan is a big giveaway to the top one percent isnt revenue neutral and would destroy  million jobs trump also struggled with analysis that his plan could hurt the economy in the long run 
the conservativeleaning tax foundation found that trumps plan would cost the us trillions of dollars and grow the incomes of the top one percent by  trumps tax plan could cost the us  million jobs 
according to a report released at the end of july by moodys analytics hillary clintons economic proposals would create millions of jobs and boost economic growth higher than current projections the analysis shows that if implemented the democratic nominees agenda would create  million jobs and accelerate economic growth to an annual average of  percent 
under trumps plan moodys estimated that unemployment would spike to  percent and over  million americans would be put out of work the us economy will weaken significantly if mr trumps economic policies are fully implemented as he has proposed the june report said the economy will suffer a recession that begins in early  and extends into even longer than the great recession 
yikes 
trump sells these plans with a broadly negative message that often strays from facts trump earned a pants on fire from politifact for this claim made june th  in his presidential announcement speech the last quarter it was just announced our gross domestic product  was below zero who ever heard of this its never below zero 
but also they note finally since trump was attacking obama for this bad quarter of growth well just throw this out of the  quarters of negative growth since world war ii  occurred under republican presidents and just  under democratic presidents 
todays new economic numbers help clinton make the argument that people should vote for her if they want to continue the record setting job growth numbers and economic growth under president obama 
hillary for america senior policy advisor jacob leibenluft pounced on the numbers to say todays gdp release shows economic growth at its fastest pace in two years but hillary clinton believes there is still more we need to do to build an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top independent experts agree her plan would create goodpaying jobs through investments in infrastructure innovation and education 
the economy is roaring back under president obama and the numbers suggest that it does better under a democratic president donald trump keeps saying clinton is  more years of obama which makes a sunny case for her 
trump is already struggling with just  days to go until the election on november th and these numbers just added more weight to his uphill battle reality has spoken and it doesnt agree with donald trumps vision of america",2016-11-01

trump being trump he stepped on stage and immediately wrecked any chance republicans had of taking advantage of the email story 
trump went into full hyperbolic overdrive in new hampshire by claiming that the fbis reopening of the investigation was bigger than watergate 
the republican nominee took back his claim that the system is rigged 
video following fbi announcement into clintons emails trump remarks the system might not be as rigged as i thought httpstcokiuxbvef 
 abc news politics abcpolitics october   
trump said but with what ive just announced previously it might not be as rigged as i thought right the fbi i think theyre going to right the ship folks i think theyre going to right the ship and theyre going to save their great reputation by doing so the speculation is that the fbi is likely to review the new emails and stick by their original finding that hillary clinton did nothing wrong 
trump and the republicans are jumping to some conclusions they know that clinton is guilty without any evidence to support their beliefs they are assuming that the fbi is going to find evidence that hillary clinton did something wrong and they think that the emails are their ticket to getting trump elected 
trump has no political skills and no idea when to use a gentle touch and stop the republican nominee destroyed any hope that the gop had of using the reopened email investigation to their advantage by letting his habits of lying and changing positions on a whim take hold

the ap is reporting breaking us official newly discovered emails related to clinton investigation did not come from her private server 
from previous reporting it is known that the emails have nothing to do with clinton her campaign the clinton foundation the russian hacks the state department and any emails she sent or received now we know that the emails were not on her server fbi director comey completely bungled this announcement and he needs to explain what the fbi is analyzing because it doesnt sound like it has anything to do with hillary clinton 
the email scandal that republicans thought would save them has evaporated nearly as quickly as it arrived with each new development it is clear that there is much less to the story than initially reported 
if the republican party wants to risk losing even more house and senate seats in  days by pursuing this nonstory they should feel free to have at it 
any time that republicans spend talking about clintons emails over the next  days will only help the democratic party",2016-11-02

we have a protester by the way were you paid  to be a thug republican nominee donald trump yelled at a black man from his lectern during a rally wednesday evening in kinston north carolina 
trump went on suggesting that the man had been paid by hillary clinton to protest trump but it turns out as usual trumps paranoia got the best of him and he kicked out his own supporter a man named cj cary who happened to be wearing a gop badge and holding a letter supporting trump but urging him to stop being so offensive 
watch here via raleighs news  observer 
the news and observer reported cary says he wanted to deliver a note to trump urging him to be less offensive and more inclusive to four demographic groups black people women people with disabilities and college students cary an africanamerican says hes an exmarine who also worked in afghanistan as a civilian for the us army 
the irony is no doubt lost on the trump crowd that this man came to urge trump to be more inclusive of african americans and he got called a paid thug and kicked out so the answer to his plea seems to be never gonna happen 
cary was wearing a gop badge and his letter slammed hillary clinton and president obama 
leave it to donald to shrink his own tent even more it wasnt enough that he tossed out a baby now hes going after his few minority supporters

the american people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately the director himself has said he doesnt know if the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not the democratic nominee said 
thats why its incumbent on the fbi to tell us what theyre talking about clinton said 
clinton pushed for more information to be released without delay she said she found about the investigation from reports and that she wasnt given advance notice clinton said she had not been contacted by comey on this issue 
when asked what she would tell voters about her emails clinton responded i think people made up their minds a while ago about the emails 
this might be the right place to mention the  million emails the bush administration lost and the private rnc servers they used as context for how important this issue really is to republicans as a value

 ruby cramer rubycramer october   
the republican fbi director james comey wrote the house on friday to inform hopeful republicans that they had found new emails relating to clintons private email that begged further investigation 
it turns out the emails didnt come from clintons server and there doesnt seem to be any there there except for giving republicans a reason their base needs to get out to vote 
federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act and this is why a complaint has already been lodged against comey  
hillary clinton laughed because what else is she supposed to do at this point how many years on is this republicans have mined this hopeful scandal for so long its doa the press has followed republicans lead with the absurd email story a story as ridiculous as it is common and a story that was never a story until clinton did it 
republicans and some in the press think this might sink the clinton campaign so they think america would rather put putins puppet who laughs about sexually assaulting women in the white house than someone whose emails weve all read now and found nothing much but gossip

the reason why the clinton email scandal is getting pushed  days before the election has nothing to with trumps doa white house bid and everything to do with helping republicans keep control of congress 
on the surface the sudden revival of hillary clintons emails looks like an october surprise designed to help republican nominee donald trump the problem with this theory is that both democrats and republicans acknowledge that trump is toast 
unless hillary clintons emails say lol i was the shooter on the grassy knoll there is nothing that would stop her from winning the election in fact the emails fbi director was investigating did not come from clinton or her server they seem to have very little to do with hillary clinton or her presidential campaign 
the emails are like catnip to republican voters who have been promised for years that if they keep sending republicans to congress theyll bring down a democratic president and that is the real reason behind the email scandal revival 
for the next ten days republican congressional candidates are going to be able to campaign on investigating hillary clinton the republican candidates can pretend like trump doesnt exist because their new pitch to voters is vote for me and ill bring down hillary 
donald trump is a lost cause millions of ballots have already been cast in swing states trump is being out organized and trounced by clinton on the ground 
to understand the real value of the email scandal to the republican party look down the ballot

the democratic coalition against trump released a statement announcing their complaint the democratic coalition against trump filed a complaint with the department of justice office of professional responsibility on friday against fbi director james comey for interfering in the presidential election following the fbis decision to open up an investigation into secretary clintons emails this close to election day federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act 
it is absolutely absurd that fbi director comey would support donald trump like this with only  days to go before the election said scott dworkin senior advisor to the democratic coalition against trump it is an obvious attack from a lifelong republican who used to serve in the bush white house just to undermine her campaign comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting america not investigating our soon to be presidentelect hillary clinton 
outrage is growing over comeys actions as details about the fbi investigation have revealed that it has nothing to do with clinton her emails or her server 
director comeys motives for sending the letter  days before a presidential election have been questioned by both republicans and democrats 
if comeys actions were politically motivated he would be in violation of the hatch act 
what republicans initially viewed as a new hope in the presidential election has quickly been exposed as a desperately political ploy

1113,associated press reporter admits faking news stories for hillary clinton stunning admission reveals how ap prints whatever the clintons want facts be damned,"by sarah jones on fri oct th  at  pm matthew miller self described recovering flack from doj dscc schooled republican fbi director james comey for violating his power and lambasted him for commenting on a case within  days of an election share on twitter print this post 
former doj spokesman for eric holder matthew miller a self described recovering flack from doj dscc schooled republican fbi director james comey for violating his power and lambasted him for commenting on a case within  days of an election 
the department and the fbi have very strict rules about when they can comment on ongoing cases and director comey has violated those rules going back to his original press conference when he closed the case miller said on cnn but this latest example violates a long standing practice which is that the department goes out of its way not to do anything that can be seen as trying to influence an election in the closing days of an election and usually they interpret the closing days to be seen as the last  days let alone the last  days 
watch here 
miller also held school on twitter about comeys abuse of power which has led to hillary clinton having to defend against a negative i wrote a piece in july on why comeys public comments about clinton were such an inappropriate abuse of power  httpstcogcrozqwz 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   he flagrantly violated doj rules with his press conference then went on to break new ground discussing details of the case to congress 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   followed by quickly releasing fbi s something they rarely do and which i doubt they will do for future highprofile cases  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   each time he either violated or seriously stretched doj rule  precedent press conference was the original sin  it begat the rest  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   but todays disclosure might be worst abuse yet doj goes out of its way to avoid publicly discussing investigations close to election  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   not just public discussion either often wont send subpoenas or take other steps that might leak until after an election is over 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   why because voters have no way to interpret fbidoj activity in a neutral way who is the target of an investigation what conduct  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   this might be totally benign  not even involve clinton but no way for press or voters to know that easy for opponent to make hay over  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   which takes us back to the original rule you dont comment on ongoing investigations then multiply that times ten close to an election  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   for whatever reason  there are many theories comey continues to ignore that but only for clinton  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   fbi is undoubtedly investigating links between the russian hack manafort  the trump campaign but arent commenting on it good

miller points out this just smells worse and worse the more we learn linking to this emails were not to or from clinton and appeared like info fbi already had wtf httpstcoysjwfwgzi 
 ken gude kengude october   
the problem with comeys actions isnt that he is investigating hillary clinton the problem is he is violating long standing rules that prohibit federal employees from doing anything that could be seen as political near an election it is an established rule that ongoing investigations arent commented on for obvious reasons 
this is quite simply not done comeys reasons for doing this are unclear and perhaps when he provides more information his decision will make more sense but its troubling that we are seeing such a consistent breakdown of tradition and rulesagreements of law surrounding the trump campaign which seems to have lowered the bar all around

1114,youtube censoring videos  on censorship,"by headly westerfield on fri oct th  at  pm as megyn kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her share on twitter print this post 
earlier this week friday fox follies  under the assumption the explosive  and bizarre battle between megyn kelly and newt gingrich would be this weeks lede  i had already tricked up an opening paragraph in case you missed it  thats when he got personal  accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues  this weeks column would have been about how the fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election the nyt calls em megyn moments  i call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the fox news channel its unthinking audience 
then came word that rupert murdoch was playing hardball as kellys contract negotiations break out into the open that paragraph lovingly crafted went out the window but lets see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings as trump congratulates newt gingrich for getting his butt kicked by megyn kelly  watch 
as kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof  rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her her contract expires next year and rupie opened up to the wall street journal  of which he is owner  to partially cajole kelly and partially to threaten her into extending her contract million in contract talks with fox news 
if they are going to make a network that is going to be a postailesposttrump it will be around megyn kelly chris wallace and shep smith and they are going to have to throw hannity and oreilly overboard said andrew tyndall a televisionnews consultant of other hosts at the network that isnt going to happen promised mr murdoch were not changing directionthat would be business suicide he said mr oreillys contract is also up at the end of next year and mr murdoch said were going to want bill to stay with us mr hannitys contract isnt up until  ms kelly has forged close ties to mr murdochs sons particularly lachlan murdoch who is coexecutive chairman of fox and has taken an active role in contract talks people close to the situation said 
fox would like to settle this before the election and before kellys book is released both of which could only strengthen her position in the negotiations if all goes well 
from the the power of megyn kellys feminismeven if she doesnt call it that  by the daily beasts tim teeman  
imagine then her mix of satisfaction and maybe ennui as she scrolled across some of the praiseridden screeds out today how megyn kelly became an improbable feminist icon vanity fair megyn kelly has become the biggest example of white feminism at work pajiba and aw crapheres proof that megyn kelly is kind of a feminist role model now the stir note the grudging headlines because of kellys employer and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional leftwing context throughout her career to date the fword mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl this in itself reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of kellys critics it is perfectly possible to work for a rightfacing institution and not be  percent right wing yourself or spout the prevailing dogma of the tv station you work for full disclosure i worked for the times of london a british rupert murdochowned newspaper for over  years 
aside from the fact that when she tilts right she tends to tilt altright the biggest knock on kelly is that shes too hardedged marshall mcluhan spoke of the medium cool of tee vee but kelly comes across as the opposite of warm and fuzzy  this makes her less attractive to other networks shes hoping to change that impression when she cohosts live with kelly ripa the kelly  kelly show the morning after the election  think of her as a designated hitter trying to knock murdochs hardball right out of the park

president barack obama did not have to do anything wrong for republicans to want to throw him in jail or to impeach him hillary clinton doesnt have to have done anything wrong either apparently for congress to appoint a special prosecutor to take her down once elected  because a bunch of emails had nothing to do with her  
at least that and completely ignoring the facts was the theme on fox news last night though to be fair other mainstream media outlets werent much better yesterday 
megyn kelly fresh from a stint of pretending to be a feminist in a faceoff with newt gingrich suggested to chairman of the house judiciary committee bob goodlatte rwv that given the fbi revelations of a complete lack of evidence that hillary clinton has done anything wrong what needs to happen is a special prosecutor 
megyn kelly  let me ask you this if she gets elected on november th this isnt going away so what needs to happen a special prosecutor she cant investigate herself as the presidentelect bob goodlatte  well first of all we have said from the outset that the house judiciary committee would follow the truth wherever it leads and we have done that throughout the summer asking a number of questions about how this investigation by the fbi was being conducted we will continue to do that we dont know whats going to happen now we dont know whats going to happen after the election so its pure speculation what will happen afterwards a special prosecutor remember is appointed by the attorney general of the united states so you have to decide whether thats going to be a fairer investigation than the one being conducted by the fbi under the direction of director comey right now and the judiciary committee will certainly stay engaged in this and continue our investigation 
democracy is a fragile thing it is to goodlattes credit that he declined the call to draw up articles of impeachment in  and that he cautioned megyn kelly that a special prosecutor is appointed not by the house but by the attorney general however the gopled house has been far too engaged already in undermining our democracy 
what holds this country together is an idea and an agreement among all parties that it works republicans have decided it only works if theyre in charge and this has brought us to the point where we threaten to jail our adversaries appoint special prosecutors if they win or vote to impeach them outright as trumps pet snake at cnn jeffrey lord called for last night  
two points anderson one with  days left this makes donald trumps argument exactly to the point here you sum up the argument in terms of her judgment her paranoia and all of the rest the second thing anderson is and this is the really disturbing thing lets just say for the sake of the argument she wins the election this isnt going to stop there will be a move to impeach her the moment her hand comes down from that bible this is going to go on and on and on and on and frankly i mean thats something the american people need to consider now 
it is not difficult to see where this will lead hillary clinton has committed no crimes far from being a miscarriage of justice though it is that as well this is a miscarriage of reason and sanity 
this sort of talk is just further evidence that donald trump comes from the same vile brew as paul ryan and mitch mcconnell and the rest of the party during the mccarthy era the house took it upon itself to be both judge and jury last night it was fox news egging the house on for more of the same

nato and washingtons activities in eastern europe and the baltics de facto amount to permanent military presence sergei ermakov a senior analyst at the russian institute for strategic studies told rt adding that we have seen only the tip of the iceberg so far endless wargames and rotational deployments essentially amount to permanent military presence nato is testing a drastic military buildup we have witnessed the alliance deploy expeditionary forces and assault troops to eastern europe these are offensive not defensive forces what we have seen is only the tip of the iceberg ermakov said 
the north atlantic alliance has pledged to refrain from deploying substantial forces along the natorussia border on a permanent basis but has been increasingly active in the region the bloc approved its largest military buildup in eastern europe and the baltics since the end of the cold war at the  warsaw summit a development viewed with deep concern in moscow 
as part of this initiative canada germany the uk and the us will establish and lead four battle groups expected to be deployed in poland estonia latvia and lithuania each will total up to  soldiers these battalions are said to become operational in early  the alliance has justified its massive buildup by blaming russia for its ostensibly assertive behavior moscow has consistently denied these groundless claims 
ermakov further explained that forces of natos european members are not as lethal as they might seem on paper this is a force exceeding russias military potential by several times but it lacks real combat power this is why americans need to be everywhere the us was forced to boost us european commands budget he said 
earlier this year the pentagon requested bn for its operations in europe in  a fourtime increase compared to its million budget this year a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
russian officials and experts have repeatedly pointed out that nato increasing assertiveness has put regional stability at risk 
the blocs muscle flexing and aggressive rhetoric greatly reduce european security and the chances for a revival of constructive dialogue between russia and nato something russia has been calling for so many years instead the bloc is doing its best to provoke an arms race with unpredictable results peter korzun an expert on wars and conflicts wrote for the strategic culture foundation ermakov also said that the united states wants to increase its presence in the black sea region to counter russia americans can no longer count on turkey due to the failed coup attempt ankara has become a complicated partner washington is instead focusing on bulgaria and romania he said 
nato secretary general jens stoltenberg mentioned romania during a press conference held following the latest meeting of natos defense ministers he said that romanian troops will join the usled battle group in poland he also said that the ministers discussed progress made in strengthening natos presence in the black sea region in the air at sea and on land this initiative will include among other things a romanianled multinational framework brigade on land he observed providing no additional information on the subject

1121,clinton campaign chair had dinner with top doj official one day after hillarys benghazi hearing,"zero hedge october   
we have written frequently in recent weeks about a feud that erupted between chelsea clinton and doug band back in  after chelsea raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest between bands firm teneo the clinton foundation and the state departmentsee here  here here and here  
the feud ultimately resulted in band being forced to draft a memo spelling out in vivid detail the many entangled relationships between himself teneo the clinton foundation and the state department fortunately todays wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals for the first time the precise financial flows between the clinton foundation bands firm teneo consulting and the clinton familys private business endeavors 
the memo starts with a brief background on teneo which was created in june  shortly after declan kelly resigned from his position as united states economic envoy to northern ireland a position to which he was appointed by secretary clinton 
in june  dk consulting was founded by declan kelley mr kelly served as coo of fti consulting until june  when he stepped down and established dk consulting at that time he also became the united states economic envoy to northern ireland  pursuant to the terms of his exit agreement with fti and consistent with the ethics agreement of his uncompensated special government employee appointment at the state department mr kelly retained and continued to provide services to three paying clients coke dow and ubs and one pro bono client allstate  in late  declan retained me as a consultant to dk consulting to help support the needs of these clients in may  mr kelly resigned his envoy position at the state department in june  mr kelly and i founded teneo strategies  simultaneously mr kelly closed dk consulting and shifted its clients to teneo 
throughout the past almost  years since president clinton left office i have sought to leverage my activities including my partner role at teneo to support and to raise funds for the foundation  this memorandum strives to set forth how i have endeavored to support the clinton foundation and president clinton personally 
in a subsequent section of the memo entitled leveraging teneo for the foundation band spells all of the donations he solicited from teneo clients for the clinton foundation in all there are roughly mm of donations listed with the largest contributors being cocacola barclays the rockefeller foundation and laureate international universities 
the donations from dow chemical are particularly notable for several reasons first because of other emails revealed by wikileaks and other foia requests we now know that dow chemical ceo andrew liveris was granted special access to then secretary clinton back in july  at the same time he was embroiled in ongoing litigation with another clinton foundation donor kuwait over a failed jointventure that would have netted dow bn in cash  as band notes in his memo  month after being granted special access to secretary clinton liveris invited president clinton and band out for a day of golf moreover shortly after his meeting with secretary clinton and golf outing with president clinton liveris decided to donate  to the clinton global initiative very convenient timing for all involved 
in august of  mr kelly invited mr liveris to play golf with president clinton and me mr kelly subsequently asked dow to become a cgi sponsor at the  level which they did  as well as making a  donation to the foundation for president clinton to attend a dow dinner in davos 
the story gets even more bizarre when band reveals in the following footnote that liveris provided the dow chemical plane to fly president clinton and his staff from new york to california and then california to north korea for their golf outing  we would assume this is a simple typo by band andor hes just geographically challengedif not this certainly raises a whole other set of questions for bill 
mr liveris provided the dow plane to fly president clinton and his staff to and from california for our trip to and from north korea  as a private trip the foundation had to pay the costs of airfare mr liveris in kind contribution saved the foundation in excess of   
according to the dialy caller  dow chemical paid teneo  million in  and  million in  for a variety of consultancy services of course bill clinton was an honorary chairman of teneo and as such was set to be paid  million for that position even though he ultimately only kept  because of the scandals that erupted around the firm including their advisory relationship with mf global 
finally band also offers the following commentary on the  million in forprofit activity he was able to secure for bill clinton as of november  as well as the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements 
independent of our fundraising and decisionmaking activities on behalf of the foundation we have dedicated ourselves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activities  including speeches books and advisory service engagements  in that context we have in effect served as agents lawyers managers and implementers to secure speaking business and advisory service deals in support of the presidents forprofit activity we also have solicited and obtained as appropriate inkind services for the president and his family  for personal travel hospitality vacation and the like neither justin nor i are separately compensated for these activities eg we do not receive a fee for or percentage of the more than  million in forprofit activity we have personally helped to secure for president clinton to date or the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements with respect to business deals for his advisory services justin and i found developed and brought to president clinton multiple arrangements for him to accept or reject of his current  arrangements we secured all of them and we have helped manage and maintain all of his forprofit business relationships since  president clintons business arrangements have yielded more than  million for him personally with  million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements 
a big part of those forprofit activities was a mm annual payment from laureate 
and millions in speaking fees arranged by band 
confused here is a simpler recap from the nyts nick confessore this doug band memo in the latest podesta dump is the rosetta stone of the teneoclinton foundation complex httpstcoagnsogpm 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   bands argument i am not get fully compensated for all of the stuff i do for clintonworld so you should let me do teneo everyone wins 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   now you could argue so what if band gets his clients to pop over money to a charity why is that bad 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   but consider that band was selling his clients on idea that giving to foundation was in essence a way to bolster their influence 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   clinton  band built a platform for executives to bolster their companies images bathe in bcs praise and do some good while 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   teneo extracted earnings for band and depending on what you see in these emails clinton himself teneo paid clinton until late  
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   i guess you can wave it all off as a nothingburger but chelsea clinton and some of clintons other aides were clearly freaking out 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   generally the emails show clintons own closest aides troubled or horrified by things that her surrogates have spent years waving off

1122,hillary takes a cookie from a little person on univision gets tequila and a huge birthday cake practices spanish dances salsa and gets called a home girl in doanything bid to crush trump in florida,"end of the american dream october   
if you want to see war without end vote for hillary clinton it is tremendously ironic that hillary clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray donald trump as dangerous and temperamental because it is clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable 
she has a temper that is absolutely legendary and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades  hillary clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in syria thanks to her libya is a postapocalyptic wasteland today and now she is picking a fight with the russians before she has even won the election of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as hillary clinton and if she wins the election i am fully convinced that world war  will begin before her time in the white house is over 
someone that shares this opinion with me is donald trump according to reuters  trump recently stated that we are going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to hillary clinton 
on syrias civil war trump said clinton could drag the united states into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict 
clinton has called for the establishment of a nofly zone and safe zones on the ground to protect noncombatants some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the united states into direct conflict with russian fighter jets 
what we should do is focus on isis we should not be focusing on syria said trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his trump national doral golf resort youre going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to hillary clinton 
in order to have a nofly zone in syria you would have to enforce it 
and in order to enforce it you would have to be willing to shoot at the russians 
according to national intelligence director james clapper  that could have dire consequences 
russia could shoot down a us aircraft if a nofly zone were imposed over syria national intelligence director james clapper said tuesday 
i wouldnt put it past them to shoot down an american aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground clapper said speaking with cbs charlie rose at the council on foreign relations in new york about several national security issues 
of course clapper is not alone in that assessment the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general joseph francis dunford says that imposing a nofly zone over all of syria would require us to go to war  
right now senator for us to control all of the airspace in syria it would require us to go to war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make  senate armed services committee september   emphasis added 
but hillary clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants 
you see the truth is that hillary clinton wants to win the war that she started in syria back in  she spearheaded an effort along with saudi arabia and turkey to try to use the arab spring uprisings in the middle east as an opportunity to try to overthrow president assad in syria if it wasnt for her meddling millions of refugees would not be pouring into europe and elsewhere and there would be no humanitarian crisis in syria at all 
thanks to russian intervention the war in syria is not too far from being over but the obama administration is desperate to keep it going they understand that if assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted and that is why they are so determined to keep aleppo from falling without aleppo many of the jihadist rebels that the obama administration has been supporting wont have anywhere to hide 
so the obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the syrian military and the russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen  if obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against syrian forces and the russians start shooting back that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control 
one recent survey found that current american leadership has a  percent approval rating in russia right now and the russians dislike hillary clinton even more than they dislike barack obama the russians know that if hillary clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us and that is why they desperately want donald trump to win in november you can see this outlook reflected in comments that russian president vladimir putin recently made about the two candidates  
mrs clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country against russia mr trump on the other hand calls for cooperation  at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism putin said 
naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us and we consider it wrong that we always have to be in conflict with one another creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world putin noted 
anyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that hillary clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for russia the thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate but it may soon become a reality 
and even now the obama administration and our nato allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with moscow this week it is being reported that nato troops will soon be sent to poland estonia latvia and lithuania  nine hundred us troops are to be sent to eastern europe next year as americas troubled relationship with russia enters new uncertain territory a usled battle group of nato allied soldiers will be sent to poland as part of the multination operation british forces will lead one of the four battle groups in estonia canada will spearhead the presence in latvia and germany will be present in lithuania 
in addition infowars is reporting that us marines will soon be stationed in norway near the border with russia 
after accepting a pentagon proposal norway will host us marines at a base near the russian border as russia deploys nuclearcapable ships to kaliningrad 
a rotating force of approximately  marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of vaernes just outside trondheim beginning in january norway and russia share an mile border in the arctic 
the us initiative to augment their training and exercises in norway by locating a marine corps rotational force in norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship said norwegian defense minister ine eriksen søreide 
most americans arent aware of any of this nor do they really care about our relationship with russia 
but in russia things are completely different the possibility of war with the united states is the biggest news story over there these days  and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation  
russian authorities have stepped up nuclearwar survival measures amid a showdown with washington dusting off sovietera civildefense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities 
at the kremlins ministry of emergency situations the cold war is back 
the country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the ussr with what officials said were  million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats 
i know that i have been writing about this over and over  but the truth is that we are on a path to war with russia and the election of hillary clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war 
in my controversial new book  i expressed my belief that war with russia is coming but at the time that i wrote it i didnt know how the election would turn out 
at this point it looks like clinton is very likely to win on november th and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with russia 
if you are reading this and you are considering voting for hillary clinton please dont do it  we simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the white house at this critical time 
if the american people do choose hillary clinton this november i believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly bitterly regret in future years this article was posted thursday october   at  am share this article",2016-10-26

sometimes a thin layer of crust accumulates on the surface of the ocean mostly made up of fecal matter and trash its where environmentalists come from 
they are effectively the pits also environmentalists hate people see top  environmentalists who openly support killing off humans  a side effect of being sad soggy little bottom dwellers so its no surprise they want to kill off coal mines in montana  despite the fact that said coal mines are pillars which help support the economy and the towns well being also electric cars  but whatever 
the  residents in southeast montana face an uphill battle to keep the city alive against an onslaught of legal battles and a major anticoal crusade launched by outsiders 
an out of court agreement was reached to close two of the four units of colstrips coalfired power plant by  the sierra club and the montana environmental information center which sued the plant see the closure as a victory 
plant operators came to an agreement with activists because oregon democratic gov signed legislation mandating the state be coalfree by  
consequences 
its a win for everybody except the people employed by the coal plant also colstrips entire economy coal plant workers make money then spend that money at other businesses except now all those lads will be jobless which means they wont be spending money or helping to boost the economy as much anymore which means other businesses will suffer thanks environmentalists 
by the way green earth sjws tend to also be fans of the indians  the people not the baseball team racist that wee tidbit is worth noting considering how their ecofriendly plan isnt very nativefriendly 
you lose two of those units and you are shutting down half the town small said this closure will have an economic impact on the reservations throughout the county and across the state small is of north cheyenne descent hes made an extra effort to recruit american indian students nearly three dozen northern cheyenne work at the colstrip plant and three times that figure work in the coal fields 
a double header bad for the economy bad for the indigenous people 
as mentioned above the coal plant never stood a chance thanks to impending regulations the plant has long seen the end drawing near possibly because they would rather close indefinitely in order to be spared from ever having to hear another squawking lobbyist attempt to talk them into seeing things their way whatever the reason environmentalists and the state teamed up to bully the coal plant into shutting down now the future of an entire town lies in jeopardy

grinnell college is promoting a guide to help students avoid cultural appropriation this halloween warning that some costumes could be considered deplorable and problematic 
the guide provides several examples of costumes that might fit the definition of cultural appropriation defining the term as the act of displaying peoples cultures in a disrespectful or condescending manner 
the guide called my identity not your costume goes on to list several examples of offensive halloween costumes featuring pictures of grinnell students holding photos of costumes that would be considered disrespectful towards their culture 
in one instance the guide shows a picture of a burly white man dressed in lingerie with a sash proclaiming call me caitlyn referring to caitlyn jenner the photo is held by a grinnell student wearing a national coming out day pin and includes a caption stating the misrepresentation of my identity bothers me because people categorize me by my looks and may not understand my culture 
another example of culturally appropriated halloween costumes according to the guide is using other cultures as accessories to appear more hipinteresting without adequate understanding or permission one example of which is a picture of someone dressed as a hindu deity being held by an indian student and the message that such costumes are deplorable and problematic 
it then warns students that if their costumes take defining characteristics of another culture without permission or understanding of the historical background behind the said culture then these costumes might be too offensive to wear 
the guide then concludes with two questions the school thinks students should consider before selecting a halloween costume asking does your costume perpetuate stereotypes or inaccurately portray my culture as a joke as well as why would i find your halloween costume to be offensive

1126,defense board white house blocked navy from s china sea warship passages,"liberty blitzkrieg october   
the name peter kadzik probably doesnt ring a bell for many of you although it probably should this guy is a real piece of work as an excellent article published earlier today at the daily caller demonstrates 
heres some of what we learned 
the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october john podesta the democrats campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends including peter kadzik a top official at the justice department 
the dinner arrangement revealed in hacked podesta emails released by wikileaks is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of states email practices 
podesta and kadzik the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show in one email from january kadzik and podesta who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign 
the political appointees in the obama administration especially in the department of justice appear to be very partisan in nature and i dont think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server says matthew whitaker the executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust a government watchdog group 
kadzik who started at the doj in  helped spearhead the effort to nominate lynch who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president 
kadzik represented podesta during the monica lewinsky investigation and in the waning days of the bill clinton administration kadzik lobbied podesta on behalf of marc rich the fugitive who bill clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office 
in a sept  email  which the washington free beacon flagged last week podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign 
podesta who would later head up the obama white house transition effort wrote that kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who kept me out of jail 
podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by independent counsel kenneth starr for the investigation but he defended the falsehoods saying later that he was merely relaying false information from clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time 
he did lie to me podesta said about clinton in a national public radio interview in  clinton was acquitted by the senate in feb  of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the lewinsky probe 
kadzik then a lawyer with the firm dickstein shapiro morin  oshinsky represented podesta through the fiasco 
podesta had been promoted to clintons chief of staff when he and kadzik became embroiled in another scandal 
kadzik was then representing marc rich a billionaire financier who was wanted by the us government for evading a  million tax bill the fugitive who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism had been living in switzerland for  years when he sought the pardon 
to help rich kadzik lobbied podesta heavily in the weeks before clinton left office on jan   
a house oversight committee report released in may  stated that kadzik was recruited into marc richs lobbying campaign because he was a longtime friend of white house chief of staff john podesta 
the report noted that kadzik contacted podesta at least seven times regarding richs pardon 
on top of the allhandsondeck lobbying effort richs exwife denise rich had doled out more than  million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon she gave  to hillary clintons new york senate campaign and another  to the clinton presidential library 
the first mention of personal contact between podesta and kadzik in the wikileaks dump is in an oct   email sent out by vincent roberti a lobbyist who is close to podesta and his superlobbyist brother tony podesta in it roberti refers to a dinner reservation at posto a washington dc restaurant 
the dinner was set for  that evening just a day after clinton gave  hours of testimony to the benghazi committee 
podesta and kadzik met several months later for dinner at podestas home another email shows  and in an email sent on may   kadziks son asked podesta for a job on the clinton campaign 
ill have the lobster risotto with a side of cronyism and middle class destruction 
as head of the office of legislative affairs kadzik handles inquiries from congress on a variety of issues in that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the clinton investigation 
the justice department and fbi have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation which concluded in july with no charges filed against clinton 
but kadzik worked on other clinton email issues in his dealings with congress 
last november he denied a request from republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation 
seems like a pretty important decision for a clinton crony to make 
the justice department declined to comment on the record for this article 
could the department of injustice have any less credibility

gop nominee donald trump took time out of a relentless campaign schedule wednesday to spend around an hour opening a new hotel prompting one cnn reporter to accuse trump of taking time out of swing states meanwhile hillary clinton is again nowhere to be seen 
cnns dana bash suggested that trump should be more concerned with campaigning in swing states yet trump had three campaign stops scheduled for the same day dana bash is your dc hotel opening free advertisingdonald trump no not at all httpstcooztrfiwim httpstcohhqooomr 
 cnn politics cnnpolitics october   
so to people who say youre taking time out of swing states to go do this you say bash asked 
i say the following you have been covering me for the last  long time i did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches and ive been doing this for weeks straight trump responded 
for you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because hillary clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps and yet youll ask me that question i think thats a very rude question to be honest with you trump exclaimed 
trump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit 
while cnn has continuously run defense for hillary clinton amid a myriad of scandals and even rigged its own polls to suggest she won the debates the network has been forced to admit that hillary is running an extremely light campaign schedule 
last month for example hillary went six days without an event except for a short speech she gave in orlando florida 
and in august hillary took seven of the first  days of the month off and even went four days without a single campaign appearance 
her speeches are so short  they dont last long theyre like  minutes and lets get out of here donald trump said about her schedule go back home and go to sleep this article was posted thursday october   at  am share this article",2016-10-26

gop nominee donald trump who has for weeks warned that the election could be rigged against him shot out a tweet thursday indicating that he is aware of reports of machines flipping to register votes for hillary clinton when voters choose trump 
a lot of callins about vote flipping at the voting booths in texas trump tweeted 
people are not happy big lines what is going on a lot of callins about vote flipping at the voting booths in texas people are not happy big lines what is going on 
 donald j trump realdonaldtrump october   
as infowars has highlighted  there have already been numerous reports of early voters in texas seeing their ballots flipped from donald trump to hillary clinton a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
while election officials have dismissed the reports suggesting user error is to blame tech experts have long warned that the machines can become less accurate over time 
larry norden a voting technology expert told npr that the reports usually arise where outdated technology is being employed 
over time as people vote that calibration becomes less and less accurate norden noted 
during elections over the past decade and more there have been reports of voting machines flipping indeed the reports were so widespread that even entertainment shows such as the simpsons drew attention to it 
meanwhile the washington post has admitted that the press is engaging in voter suppression bizarrely claiming it is a legitimate way of countering trumps rigged election claims 
callum borchers author at the washington post blog the fix writes since the final presidential debate last week many news outlets have been delivering an unvarnished message to donald trump supporters your candidate is virtually certain to lose the election nov  a day later the timess upshot blog increased clintons chances of winning to  percent  an alltime high on monday politicos ben schreckinger wrote that  donald trumps path to an election night win is almost entirely closed  here at the fix chris cillizza and aaron blake wrote that  donald trumps chances of winning are approaching zero  these are accurate statistically sound statements but they are something else too declarations that trump is highly unlikely to win also serve as counters to the republican nominees warning that the rigged election could be  stolen from us  
the latest polls which trump insists are rigged due to oversampling show clinton with a double digit lead 
however hillary clintons campaign manager robby mook has warned that trumps suggestions that the polls are wrong and he can still win are absolutely right 
weve seen polls tighten since the third debate and we expect things to get even closer before election day mook said urging clinton supporters to vote 
make no mistake with only  percent of votes cast donald trump could win this election mook said   ",2016-10-26

on wednesdays morning joe  cohost joe scarborough once again was forced to actually tell the truth about the liberal bias in media coverage throughout this entire election 
scarborough a former florida republican congressman began the discussion stating that 
as a republican theres a natural reaction to press bias and it has been so overwhelming even if it is has been earned the media has taken sides theyve aggressively taken sides and theyve admitted that were aggressively taking sides and i think you get some republicans that see that every four years its so funny they do that every four years every four years its like the end of the world if a republican gets elected president because theyre all racist its the boy that cried wolf 
in a sense what was articulated is that the mass medias historic liberal bias against conservatives is reflected in every election so much so that in this one their usual partisan attacks against trumps controversial personality are not as effective also scarborough stated the fact shared by many conservatives that there is an overwhelming and aggressive agenda by the press to defend liberals 
furthermore in conversation with frequent panelist mike barnicle scarborough added also its such a confounding election where we go back and forth on what its about mike barnicle said all along that its about hillary clinton people say im going to vote for hillary clinton as a protest against and then after sitting on that for a couple of weeks that thought for a couple weeks they go ehmaybe not 
in a way they were all trying to explain how trump is still almost tied to clinton in a number of battleground state polls despite the disproportionate amount of negative coverage later on in response to cohost willie geists remarks about the race being almost over scarborough proved his earlier point about the medias disconnect 
i got to say willie everybody that is saying its over and youre a fool if youre suggesting that the american people may have the final say at the voting booth are the same people that were saying in august september october november december january february that there was no way in a million years that donald trump would ever win the republican nomination stating it just as emphatically as theyre stating now that we need to avert our eyes this race is over

cnn commentator angela rye on wednesday blamed the failure of republicans to repeal and replace obamacare for the newly announced doubledigit premium increases in the presidents signature health care law 
its not just hillary clinton that needs to tackle this but also congress rye said on cnns new day the reason we are in the position that we are in right now frankly alisyn is because republicans fell short of their promise to repeal which is what they said they wanted to do and replace 
host alisyn camerota stopped rye before she got any further and reminded her that president obama had promised premiums would go down 
most states will see health care premiums under the affordable care act increase by an average of  percent according to data released this week by the obama administration indiana will see its rates slightly go down but other states like arizona will see costs skyrocket by  percent members of the administration have been quick to soften the blow of the increase by reminding people that a majority of those on the obamacare exchanges would be receiving tax credits to help pay for the now more expensive health insurance plans   ",2016-10-26

the statement may be as premature as the one made in the same words by then us president george w bush after the iraq invasion in  rts crew on the ground reports that dozens of people remain at the camp 
soon after that statement was made we went inside and saw that there was either a massive blunder in terms of their public relations line or a lie the camp was far from being evacuated and closed rts harry fear reported from the scene 
on thursday buccio warned that refugees arriving at the jungle camp in the future would not be offered resettlement unlike those evacuated in recent days

the number of wild animals on earth could fall by more than twothirds in the  years to  according to a new report which places the blame on the destruction of habitats hunting and pollution the forecast could lead to major consequences for humans 
the living planet report  says that animal losses are on track to reach  percent in the  years to  the reports authors also took into consideration a recent trend in animal population decline citing a  percent plummet between  and  
the researchers analyzed the changing presence of  monitored populations of the  vertebrate species  mammals birds fish amphibians and reptiles among them 
according to the paper the biggest cause of the plummeting animal populations is the destruction of wilderness areas by farming and logging pollution was also mentioned as a significant problem vaccineladen mms to be distributed via drone for endangered ferrets httpstcowmduucnxn pictwittercomafxrag 
humanitys misuse of natural resources is threatening habitats pushing irreplaceable species to the brink and threatening the stability of our climate said wwfs director of science mike barrett a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
animals across the planet are expected to be affected however rivers and lakes are the hardesthit areas barrett noted that global warming is exacerbating the pressures 
we are no longer a small world on a big planet we are now a big world on a small planet where we have reached a saturation point the stockholm resilience centers professor johan rockström said in a foreword for the report 
the decline in wildlife along with climate change is part of the proposed notion of anthropocene a term which suggests a new era in which humans have managed to have a significant global impact on earths geology and ecosystems 
the notion  which has yet to be officially approved as a term used to explain geological time  can lead to major consequences 
the richness and diversity of life on earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems as we know them today will collapse wwf directorgeneral marco lambertini said as quoted by the guardian 
in fact the report states that humans could be anything but happy if the forecast comes to fruition noting that the predicted situation could provoke serious competition 
increased human pressure threatens the natural resources that humanity depends upon increasing the risk of water and food insecurity and competition over natural resources the report states 
there does however appear to be some hope some species are beginning to recover suggesting that conservation efforts could help tackle the crisis 
however barrett noted that in order for such efforts to take place society must largely change how it consumes resources 
youd like to think that was a nobrainer in that if a business is consuming the raw materials for its products in a way that is not sustainable then inevitably it will eventually put itself out of business barrett said 
the report is certainly a pretty shocking snapshot of where we are he added my hope though is that we dont throw our hands up in despair  there is no time for despair we have to crack on and act i do remain convinced we can find our sustainable course through the anthropocene but the will has to be there to do it

1162,get ready for civil unrest survey finds that most americans are concerned about election violence,"record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban 
steve   
a new poll released by gallup has found that a record amount of americans are opposed to gun control measures  
the survey found that  percent of respondents over three quarters believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law 
the findings represent a fourpoint increase on the same survey from last year in addition to an alltime high for the past three decades 
the poll also found that almost two thirds  percent are against a ban on semiautomatic rifles or assault weaponsas the corporate media refers to them 
that figure represents a full tenpoint increase on previous findings and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue  years ago 
just  percent less than a third say they support a ban on handgun ownership while only  percent support a semiautomatic ban an eightpoint decline on previous findings 
in addition gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end 
in a summary of the new poll gallup seemed surprised by the findings describing waning support for a gun ban as a paradox 
perhaps paradoxically opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles these guns were used in highprofile incidents including the terrorist attacks in san bernardino california and orlando and the mass shootings in aurora colorado and newtown connecticut 
the findings reveal just how out of step hillary clintons position on gun control is with the majority of americans 
hillary is a staunch gun control proponent wikileaks releases have revealed that hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order

the deployment which was first floated in the press by uk defense chiefs on wednesday appears to have been prepared well in advance 
it will see up to  armored infantry troops deployed to estonia and royal air force raf fighter jets deployed to romania in what appears to be a reiteration of the strategy of containment employed against the soviet union during the cold war 
france and denmark will also commit more troops 
on wednesday uk defence secretary michael fallon struck a belligerent tone in the wall street journal when he warned that europe  is our continent  and as such would be defended

he denied the placement of small formations around the baltic area are merely a  tripwire  in case of the muchheralded but hypothetical clash with russia 
 this is a serious military presence  he said 
tensions have only just begun to subside after a fleet of russian naval vessels bound for the mediterranean sea passed through the north sea and english channel 
the passage caused a press frenzy in the uk framed as though russia was launching an invasion of the british isles the royal navy deployed destroyers to in fallons words  manmark  the vessels while the raf overflew the ships with fighter jets 
according to the russian military the naval groups task was to  ensure a naval presence in operationally significant areas of the worlds oceans  as well as  the safety of maritime navigation and other maritime economic activities  of russia

here are several more of the instances from today 
despite getting major coverage on the drudge report no mainstream news outlet has covered the apparent issue with clintons eyes 
but the several instances over the last few weeks and as recently as last friday  have been enough for doctors to publicly call on clinton to undergo a full medical example and release the results 
my rational self would say that they could have defused all this a long time ago by releasing her medical records and having her undergo the same type of neurologic exam that every high school football player in america who gets his bell rung on friday night must undergo before he can suit up for the game next friday dr john r coppedge a surgical specialist from texas told the american mirror  a d v e r t i s e m e n t

kevin shippwhy dont more whistleblowers come out to expose illegal or unconstitutional secret government operations if these activities are so illegal why are people not coming forward to report themover the last fifty years us government intelligence agencies have perfected a complex sequential system to systematically silence or destroy any employee including his or her family who attempts to reveal illegal or unconstitutional activities conducted as part of secret government operationsas a condition of employment military and intelligence employees recruited for secret operations are required to sign a secrecy agreement or nondisclosure agreement before being given access to the position which offers high pay and status in the organization this agreement threatens civil and criminal penalties if the employee reveals any information regarding the program thinking the agreement will only be used for legal purposes and will get them the coveted job all employees eagerly sign itthis secrecy agreement was originally designed to protect legitimate classified information to protect military personnel during wartime and protect legitimate national defense information and technologyhowever because of the binding power of the agreement government agencies began using it as a powerful tool to silence federal employees who question the legality of certain government operations it was the perfect tool to threaten silence or jail any whistle blower who dared to challenge the secret operations of governmenttoday the secrecy agreement is routinely used as an efficient weapon to intimidate or silence employees annual refresher briefings are given to remind employees of the penalties for violating the agreement these penalties include huge fines termination financial ruin and even prison  all of which mean the destruction of their lives and their families most will not reveal any wrongdoing no matter how egregious for fear of calculated severe retributionwhen employees sign the secrecy agreement and are cleared for classified programs they are not told they are giving up their right to a jury trial or to sue the agency that hired them if they try to do so as a whistle blower they find they have no right to be heard in federal court many have found this out when their case was denied then it was too late that is part of the systemif the employee attempts to contact their congressman or senator their representative is blocked from receiving any information about their case because they do not have the necessary clearancewhen the employee attempts to blow the whistle to the congressional intelligence committees their response is ignored it is made clear to committee members that they are not to touch such cases so they refer them back to their senator or congressman who cannot access information involved in their caseif a courageous employee continues to proceed and blow the whistle a system of personal and career destruction follows this begins with promotions being denied being turned down for sensitive or career enhancing assignments and their files being flagged ruining their reputation inside their agency at this point their career is over if they go quietly the retribution stopswhen the employee still continues their effort to report the information their travel records personnel records medical records and security records are searched for mistakes or damaging information that can be used to threaten them with termination their telephones and computers are monitored searching for incriminating information if no substantive information can be found it is fabricated and placed in their fileemployees who refuse to back down are then subjected to internal security investigations multiple hostile interviews attempting to get them to recant their information and multiple polygraph interrogationsin many cases the employee is commanded to report to the internal medical office for psychological evaluation if they comply the evaluation labels them as paranoid unstable or disgruntled this information is placed in their file and is used later to justify the agencys action in the event of outside scrutinyif the employee contacts a member of the news media they are immediately cited with violating their secrecy agreement and criminal penalties are filed against them several news media outlets are connected to the cia and nsa and notify them of the employees contactfinally the employee is forced to resign after being threatened with termination in kangaroo court meetings where the information fabricated in their files is used against themafter termination or forced resignation interest rates on their internal credit union loans are raised to make the payments unaffordable the release of the employees retirement funds needed provide for their family are blocked a felony the agency black lists them from gaining employment with other government agencies or contractors further ruining them financiallydehumanized financially ruined and under severe emotional and mental pressure the employees family begins to break apart if the familys foundation is not strong this results in alcoholism depression and divorce in some cases it has resulted in the employee committing suicide the ultimate goal of the program of destruction this silences the employee permanently obscuring the agencys role in their destruction it is the perfect crimeshould the employee still have the resolve to endure this program of career and personal destruction and continues to press for release of the information or if his family members attempt to sue the agency for the illegal activity classified agencies will invoke the secretive state secrets privilege which orders the employee and his family not to reveal the information or face prison if the familys case reaches federal court the state secrets privilege is invoked and the case is shut down  and sealed federal judges rubber stamp the censoring of the case without reviewing the case factsnow that the employees case and in some cases their familys case is shut down and under seal citing national security the process of silencing the employee is complete many are never heard from again fearing prison if they talk to anyone including an attorneyusing attractive awards of multimillion dollar contracts the us government military industrial complex convinces private corporations that their employees must be cleared and sign secrecy agreements this includes employees at all levels from secretaries to ceos once they have signed the secrecy agreement they are bound to keep all information including potentially illegal information quiet being threatened with the same penaltiesto date over five million americans have been required to sign this secrecy agreement and now fall under the shadow of the state secrets privilegeonly a few federal employees have made it through this systematic process of destruction to reveal what they know about the illegal operation they observed sadly some whistle blowers have died mysterious deaths or committed suicideemployees in intelligence agencies are aware of penalties contained in the secrecy agreement and the huge risk in violating it even to expose corruption most look the other way to protect their careers retirements and families many have observed the outward signs of the system of personal and career destruction used on others and a culture of fear exists but they are not fully aware of all that is being done the full scope of the system is only known at the higher levels of the organization and is hidden from employees until its use is necessarythis is why we do not see whistle blowers coming out and reporting what they have seen this system has been used and perfected for over fifty years it is being used because it worksit works unless the system is exposed the whistle blower knows what is coming and prepares for it and they are supported by private organizations and individuals dedicated to truth in governmentthis support is essential not only to protect the whistle blower and their family but also to defend our

1170,leaked memo exposes shady dealings between clinton foundation donors and bills forprofit activities,"proud shares 
the nras magazine acknowledged that president obama really hasnt had the opportunity to confiscate firearms undercutting years of fearmongering about the supposed existence of a  massive obama conspiracy  to dismantle the second amendment and take guns away 
the nras admission that a president cant confiscate guns because congress writes the laws not the president also demonstrates the implausibility of repeated recent claims from the nra that link hillary clinton to gun confiscation 
the admission was included in a june  article for nra magazine americas st freedom which took issue with how obama rudely responded to a question from a gun store owner at a recent town hall event 
the article quoted obama as telling the questioner im about to leave office there have been more guns sold since ive been president than just about any time in us history there are enough guns for every man woman and child in this country and at no point have i ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners so it is just not true 
responding to obamas statement the article acknowledged now the gun store ownercould have interrupted the president to mention that obama really hasnt had the opportunity to do that congress writes the laws not the president 
rhude didnt sit down after asking his question rather he stood silently as president obama didnt even try to answer his question but instead went off on a defensive tirade first of all the notion that i or hillary or democrats or whoever you want to choose are hellbent on taking away folks guns is just not true and i dont care how many times the nra says it 
obama then said im about to leave office there have been more guns sold since ive been president than just about any time in us history there are enough guns for every man woman and child in this country and at no point have i ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners so it is just not true 
now rhude could have interrupted the president to mention that obama really hasnt had the opportunity to do that congress writes the laws not the president he could then have listed the many attacks on the right to bear arms  from operation fast and furious to operation choke point to obamas attempted ban on common ammunition for artype rifles to his using a pen and phone to push antigun executive actions but rhude respectfully stayed silent 
claims about gun confiscation and obama have been the nras bread and butter for the past eight years  more recently the nra has suggested that the election of clinton could lead to gun confiscation for lawabiding americans

1172,uk economy grows pc in the wake of brexit vote defying recession fears,"during the height of the cold war the cia attempted to develop mind control techniques with the mkultra program as it happens the communists already had a leg up on them well explore how this was done along with some new twists
the criticism and selfcriticism technique in history this is what happens to people who joke about chairman mao ripping off hillarys wardrobe
the technique of  criticism and selfcriticism  kritika i samokritika was developed during the early days of the soviet union  this got results when the early soviet show trials and purges took place the targets would confess to committing treasonthe details stretching credulityand beg for execution the maoists chinese communists used it too typically during  struggle sessions  also forced confessions were required in vietnam for prisoners in reeducation camps 
what happened wasnt much different from a medieval inquisition those targeted would be badgered until they confessed to whatever it was they supposedly did of course physical forms of coercion were also an option these werent actual trials their fates were already decided
the lucky ones were released and got to resume their lives as before after their memorable reminder to toe the party line others faced stiffer penalties than that from loss of party membership and accompanying status all the way up to execution no amount of compliance or abject groveling could save them if it was predetermined that they were going to be purged or killed
after the ordeal survivors were surely scared witless with their egos beaten down they were ready to do as they were told without question its basically a form of brainwashing as for those who were executed after that the purpose of going through the motions was for benefit of the audience it was political theater convincing those present that they were delivering justice to wrongdoers and serving as an example of what could happen to those who step out of line
other than that the criticism and selfcriticism techniquebadgering and forcing a confessionalso was picked up in the usa during the s by certain cults and oddball encounter groups today we might think of these strange and humiliating rituals as a thing of the past but the truth is that theyve merely changed form  as ive noted previously  cultural marxism is a crappy and inherently destructive forexport variety of communism so its no great surprise that it has adapted this technique for its purposes
modern witch hunts this is what happens to people who say that bruce jenner is actually a dude
when people are encouraged to become incensed over even tiny things  this causes a walking on eggshells atmosphere in todays politically correct climate its easy to run afoul of the thought police this might result in a visit to the hr department or a campus speech code investigation however if the thoughtcrime is serious enoughor the target is prominent enoughthen this can ignite a media circus  also someone could end up featured on a mailing list for social justice warriors  besides just trolling and harassment this can result in doxxing release of your personal information or pressure on an employer to fire the thought criminal
we in the western world pride ourselves on the right to free speech that was one of the main goals of liberalism back in the th century when liberalism was still a good thing actually many free countries criminalize politically incorrect speech even in places that dont have legal penalties for speaking your mind it carries the risk of the loss of your livelihood  this effectively makes entire policy arguments forbidden to articulate which naturally is the whole point other goals of course are information control and thus thought control so much for freedom of speech it took a few centuries but liberals now oppose what they once stood for
the following scenario has happened time and again someone points out an inconvenient truth  writes something that offends someone donates to the wrong cause mocks a feminists first world problems  tells an offcolor joke  or even wears the wrong tshirt  then the feeding frenzy begins resulting in torrents of criticism usually the target apologizes profusely but loses his job no matter how abject or groveling his apologies are
its possible to convince a judge and twelve jurors that youre not guilty of something but good luck getting the media or an online sjw mob to calm down and leave you alone the traditional communist session was better in one way that is they quit after breaking the targets will a modern feeding frenzy though can drag on for months even after the target has been begging for forgiveness what goes on the internet can stay there forever including lies about you
if you get caught in a social justice weenie witch hunt  never apologize explain and clarify if you absolutely must this is for the benefit of the uncommitted the sjws will already have made up their small minds about you and wont stop no matter what you do never let them break your frame instead go on the attack you have a right to your own opinion and to express it
if you beg for their forgiveness then you will be allowing them to turn their criticism into your selfcriticism remember that groveling is unlikely to save you apologies are for people who actually did something wrong having a difference of opinion isnt wrong despite some peoples curious notions about freedom of speech
here are some other particulars to remember
you cant reason with them  online mobs dont know you and have been told that youre an evildoer youll probably never know exactly what was said about you who said it and what email list all that was on if you do find out sue for defamation of character however you can be sure that youve already been deemed guilty theyre not interested in the truth sjws have great difficulty comprehending basic logic many of them dont even believe in objective reality  only their feelings are real to them why would the truth matter to these idiots finally social justice weenies are a bunch of losers  their opinion of you matters less than that of a snotty child cursing you out therefore dont let these oxygenwasters mess with your selfesteem societal criticism and selfcriticism wallowing in guilt at its finest
the frankfurt school  a communist think tank that moved to the usa and began subverting the educational system developed critical theory  one of their top classics was eros and civilization by herbert marcuse it contained lots of freudian arguments on how our society was too repressed and we needed to loosen up our morals another was the authoritarian personality by theodor adorno that too contained freudian mumbojumbo smearing right wing politics with accusations of neurosis and homo daddy issues all told they wrote dozens of books along those lines some attacking western civilization directly these vaporings wouldnt have amounted to much if they hadnt become trendy in academia and influenced the s zeitgeist
meanwhile radical feminismthe second wavewas starting up this too had lots of communist influence  another front of cultural marxism this also was all about criticism of our culture this caused friction between the sexes driving a wedge deep into the heart of society the results included the snarky snotty and spoiled attitudes youve surely encountered worse this caused untold misery from high divorce rates and broken homes 
this was one of several movements that became prominent during the s and are still with us today surely you can think of many others the methodology was the sameall angrily made overblown complaints about how bad society has been to them the way they tell it theyre out fighting for their rights the goal of cultural marxism though was all about attacking our morale and softening us up the people involved in those movements were merely tools being used by leaders who were in it for power money and status
the educational system has been dumbed down  history has been rewritten too figures like christopher columbus and the us founding fathers are bad guys now even as early as the s campuses were hellbent in purging dwems their charming term for dead white european males from the literary canon none of this was really about inclusiveness its all about robbing our people of our heritage making us ashamed of our accomplishments and destroying our resolve
the propaganda is everywhere television is full of social and political messages even in shows for children  and piggybacked onto advertisements too sensitivity training courses deliver politically correct indoctrination college campuses are notorious for pushing propaganda this even happens to elementary school kids my first exposure was in second grade some of the indoctrination exercises require audience participation such as forcing them to fill out privilege checklists with the facts cherrypicked  to instill a sense of collective guilt
all this has worked according to plan many are out of touch with their roots and dont understand that they have a heritage worth preserving worse others have been infected by guilt trips sometimes this leads to public spectacles of wallowing in guilt again theres the selfcriticism part
the antidote to this is the truth the fact is every civilization has its good points and its bad points and ours is no exception its rotten hypocrisy for the bullshit merchants in academia and the media to dwell on our faults and overlook those of other parts of the world while selectively ignoring our accomplishments and elevating those of others  the truth is that none of our shortcomings or misdeeds are solely found in western civilization but some of our good characteristics are indeed unique
you can protect your children by home schooling them or sending them to a private school where they wont be indoctrinated you can always get rid of your tv too meanwhile though millions of other students will be putty in the hands of propagandizing professors and teachers and of course the lying media those pushing this from the top down must be called out exposed and removed from power

1174,college warns against deplorable and problematic costumes,"at the third debate donald trump was asked if he would accept the results of the election trump responded that he would have to look at the process to determine if everything was done fairly before he could accept it the media went berserk claiming that trump was undermining democracy but is the us system really rigged and if it is can trump overcome it
why rig the system the elite realize that their time is short
woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time revelation 
it is human nature to want to accumulate wealth it is also human nature to want to keep what you have one of the ways that the wealthy do that is through influencing the political process to ensure it is favorable to them a democratic republic is particularly easy to influence the wealthy elite can buy candidates through donations to them or to their superpacs they can make voting patterns more favorable to them by changing the countrys demographics or they can influence voters through the supposedly unbiased news media that they control in the us the wealthy elite use every one of these levers to rig the system
for example liberal voters often favor a progressive tax system where high earners pay greater percentages than those who earn less it sounds like a populist policy but it is not progressive taxation is put in place to prevent middle class people from rising into the ranks of the truly wealthy who have already accumulated their wealth and are taxed at the much lower capital gains rate progressive taxation keeps the rich on top and keeps the plebs down thats why no matter which political party is in power we are still stuck with progressive taxation
everything goes well as long as both parties dont rock the boat but once you get a true wildcard like trump the system must spring into action to stop the threat to the established order thats what we are seeing now the elite are using every tool in the arsenal of the rigged system to ensure trump does not upset their gravy train the elite sense their time is short
voter fraud 
the first way in which the election is rigged is through voter fraud in his gettysburg address trump outlined some of the ways in which this occurs
according to pew there are  million voter registrations that in the us that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate  million dead people are registered to vote and some of them are voting i wonder how that happens  million people are registered to vote in more than one state these are numbers folks these are numbers  of noncitizens are registered to vote
liberals always object to any sort of voter identification requirement they say that it negatively affects minority voters who may not have any identification but this is obvious nonsense the real reason liberals oppose voter identification is because it would make voter fraud more difficult
by raising concerns about voter fraud trump is firing a warning shot he is saying that he will fight voter fraud unlike prior gop candidates who preferred defeat to calling out cheating by the other side simply putting the democrats on notice may cause them to cheat less than they would have otherwise the only question is whether trump will be able to muster enough votes to overcome the amount of cheating that will take place
the lügenpresse 
a second way that the system is rigged is through the legacy news media these include the three oldest television news networks abc cbs nbc as well as the newer ones cnn msnbc fox it also includes the remaining newspapers especially the new york times washington post and the wall street journal of these the only ones that are reliably conservative are fox and the wsj both of which are owned by rupert murdock but even here it is more accurate to call fox and the wsj neoliberal rather than conservative as they both push the globalist message of open borders and unenforced trade
trump is very media savvy hes been in the public eye since the s and his philosophy has been that no publicity is bad publicity trump has used this to highlight his policies by making controversial statements he has been able to force the media to cover his positions still the nonstop smear campaign has hurt trumps numbers particularly among older voters who still get their news from legacy sources
new media outlets like return of kings breitbart and danger  play have been more favorable to trump but the most highly funded new media such as daily beast heat street buzzfeed and huffington post all push the globalist message the end result that trump is fighting an ocean of disinformation with only a handful of allies by his side
voter discouragement fivethirtyeight doing its best to discourage trump voters
another way that that system is rigged is that the legacy media conspires to discourage trump voters from going to the polls one way they do this is to over poll democrats to make it look like trump is losing for example one recent poll placed hillary  points higher than trump but even obama was only able to beat mccain by  points even though he was packing stadiums of  people and hillary doesnt command the sort of adulation that obama did in 
there is a huge motivation gap between trump and clinton recently trump held a rally in tampa where  people showed up some of these people waited in line for  hours for the chance to see trump a day later hillary hosted a rally in florida where only  people showed up and some of those were likely paid plants her running mate tim kaine did even worse barely getting  people to show up for one of his events
one day before the brexit vote polls showed remain leading by  points leave ended up winning by  points
why does the legacy media report polls that show trump losing by a landslide because it is designed to dishearten trump voters
conclusion will trump be able to overcome the rigged system it will be a heroic achievement if he does one thing is certain this is not the time to give up but to fight with all of our might the elites want us to be discouraged to give up hope to lie down and die that is the one thing we will never do even if the host of hell rise up to oppose you go to the ballot box on november th regardless of what you may hear otherwise your life will be very different under president trump than it will be under globalist pawn hillary
win or lose our battle to bring back the patriarchy will not end on november  th  a trump victory would give us breathing room to start restoring our society in the open a hillary victory heaven forbid would signal that our work will need to be underground either way our battle is just beginning in future columns i will outline the way forward for traditional men

1175,meet peter kadzik  another clinton stooge at the justice department,"last week i expounded the idea that we should take the time to ponder about emotions  these matter much in prompting us to take action or not to to think about something or not to sustained emotional states can lead us to pedestalize girls ignore our own needs or refraining from caring about our own interests whereas others push theirs every day they can also allow said girls to go shamelessly after shortterm pleasure or be complacent to rapefugees while shrieking and fingerwaving against men of their own kin
pondering passions and emotions does not mean getting led by them at the expense of critical thinking rather it is the exact opposite as it allows us to spot the shrewd ones who want to push our emotional buttons as well as being freer to take more thoughtful and actually less emotiondetermined actions once we have gained awareness of passions we can decide which ones we want to stimulate and why
following this idea i made some suggestions of how and in whom we could stir positive emotions such empathy hope and love today i will do the same with four other passions or emotions admiration shame humility and fear
 admiration 
society i think should admit some victimhood to those who were raised as weaklings or acted cluelessly out of good intentions women in particular should be more empathetic and nurturing towards nice and beta malesas long as their empathy does not extent out of admitted boundarieshence taking an opposite direction from the egotistical uncaring orientation a lot of them currently harbor of course this should not equate to validating too much the unhealthy unmanly men women should also be trained into validating more manlier men and here admiration comes into play
as nassim taleb put it we are living more and more in an extremistan where those at the highest level take the lions share while the resources diminish quickly down the ladder girls today tend to admire only the most famous or highstatus people which leads them to despise the ninetynine per cent this exasperated hypergamy should be tamed so that the average man as long as he achieves the minimum andor is upstanding and dutiful gets his fair share a more democratic but still conditional distribution of girls admiration would reward actual good behaviour for men and decrease the intramasculine competition 
girls should also admireand not mockproper feminine role models upstanding mothers females taking proper care of themselves and so on ought to be at least esteemed by the average girl
 shame 
shame arises from measuring our actions against moral standards and discovering that they fall short if our actions fall short and we fail to notice we can be shamed or made to notice shame is normally accentuated if its object is exposed but unlike embarrassment also attaches to a thought or action that remains undisclosed and undiscoverable to others neel burton heaven and hell  chap p
a particularly strong emotion shame usually comes as a blow makes one lose face or composure to eventually feel guilt or remorse just like other strong emotions it has been used with consumed malignancy by the left
leftists created a narrative where whites are held entirely responsible for dreadful historical phenomena such as slavery the holocaust an oppression of minority groups or racism as these phenomena are constantly talked about and expanded whites are also supposed to feel a correspondingly boundless guilt the sheer power of guilt can explain why so many whites have been afraid to stand up being shamed as a racist or nazi can be enough to endure rejection from ones family lose reputation and employment
shame can be aroused through two levers the standards one agrees with and ones purported responsibility both levers have been skillfully used to un shame the liberalfavored groups as for the standards feminists attacked what they called slutshaming while also shaming relentlessly manly behavior and as for the responsibility pretty much all those who claim to identify with a minority tend to deny all by slipping it over the majoritys shoulders
this is how you get persistent offenders or jihadi families expressing neither shame nor remorse whereas the productive working and normally sociable person gets nagged for being white in the current year better be a true rapist who can evade responsibility and shame by invading europe than a young virgin of european descent
what we should do here sounds pretty obvious in theory though it will be much harder to carry on in practice as people evidently hate being shamed especially when they have been accustomed of blaming everything on the others
shame the fatties  shame the arrogant snowflakes whose unwillingness to respect is all too obvious recall the selfdetermination of antiwhite liberals and criminals they all made free choices they should carry all associated responsibility
as for us we must keep our face straight never make clueless concessions to skillful framers or hysterical sjws if they appeal to moral standards put forth your own as legitimate if they appeal to your purported actions or responsibility emphasize theirsand how it cannot be boiled down to external factors
even dogs and cats are considered responsible by their caretakers so they can be punished for bad behaviours and learn likewise granting certain people or groups a constant deresponsabilization amounts to give them a free pass for destroying everything criminals of said groups have agency and the liberals who gave them a pass to plunder and kill whitey are responsible as well
shame can also arise from being associated with something or someone deemed as despicable the liberal policy of distinguishing sharply between terrorists and documented aliens in spite of how much the latter to house the former allows for the latter going without shame even when they are closely associated with terroristswhereas every white is threatened with shame if he has a ist or phobic acquaintance
turn the table shake off the burden from the disenfranchised majority and put it back on those who have been acting with impunity for too long
 humility 
current year girls overinflated ego is enough notwithstanding economic or racial factors to explain a host of social problems blinded by it girls ignore how much they are determined by their own cravings shortterm desires or by the latest fashions around they drink loads of booze fuck with random strangers reframe their story as a rape later so they can blame it all on the guy  they never learn to cook clean take care of something else than their instagram account and corporate career speaking of corporate isnt it striking that so many men are badly in need of employment sex and have almost nothing whereas spoiled corporate drones believe they can havetakeit all
ego makes one lose any sense of proportion or balance it leads to complacency merciless exploitation of others refusal to take responsibility and open despise
augustine of hippo wrote that humility was at the foundation of all other virtues this makes sense if ones ego is inflated one does not feel the need to practice virtues and feels entitled to never be ashamed of her shortcomingsthat are easily denied or blamed on someone else ego also leads to wasting resources on luxury parce que je le vaux bien  as says a famous brand of cosmetics instead of focusing on selfimprovement or caretaking
though girls should be the first to have their ego smashed as the survival of basic family units depends on it bloated ego is a general disease in our age men too can be sold the idea that say being a smug urban elf is a proof that one sides with progress and civilization whereas they are actually weak dependent and unable to fix anything by themselves its not all about our individual selves
 fear 
readers asked for it so here it is fear is a very powerful emotion to the point of prompting one to freeze flee abandon a previously planned course of action or never even think to consider an idea or an action the left has been using it in two different albeit complementary ways
first it has constantly accused conservatives to play on fears implying irrational or unjustified fears when they dared to ask serious questions or making realistic assessment when the  immigration act was voted democrat senators pretended that opening up the borders would not change the ethnic mix of america and that any suspicion it might happen was highly emotional in france the socialists and mainstream righters alike have been carrying the same accusations here the left accused any doubt to be a hint of unjustified and intolerable fear
well what happened since doesnt it look like every fear from the right was justifiedespecially since the postww right has always been incredibly wary not to say coward when it came to criticize the lefts moral high ground
second the left has also been keen on doing exactly what it accused the conservatives to do namely stirring fear about political bogeymen liberals invented rape culture or patriarchal oppression when men actually became weaker they associated to nazism any white person who assumes his race should basically survive they shamelessly bludgeoned whom they could call white supremacists as if defending ones right to live in peace against hordes of thugs and violent parasites was equal to being hitler himself
whites were led to fear their own supposed authoritarian tendencies as the shrewd jews who intrigued through the frankfurt school put it see kevin macdonald culture of critique  chap whites were led to fear some of their fearsbetter have ones daughter killed by muslims than expressing concerns about them to other whites because racism is so evil boo
when i was younger i noticed the local thugs had a huge advantage over us normal people they were much more fearless they had this devilmaycare provocative attitude which made them potentially dangerous to the bourgeois prude beta male and attractive to females not incidentally the first movie of the french essayist alain soral confessions dun dragueur confessions of a womanizer shows a young arab with decent pickup experience taking a young middleclass white boy under his wing as to help him escape from virginity
feeling fear is a necessary step in life fear appears greatly useful when there is something to flee from or watch as a potential hazard but being too fearful or afraid of the wrong things can be a serious liability never trust a liberal who either points finger at you for being fearful or tries to paint you as dangerous and justifying his own fearmongering
on the flip side being feared by others is not always a negative some people need to be afraid to respect you if you try to treat them correctly or let free rein to your innate generosity they will harm and exploit you such people just as everyone around who may be tempted to disrespect should be kept in check by a minimal fear better be feared and respected than getting tread upon
conclusion frame and un frame whatever matters when you have to as you have to the left cursed us by locking us into an always negative framing when we fail whatever the reason we are despised as weak or losers and when we succeed they say we are privileged and oppressive in both cases the chosen framing leads to negative emotions associated to us no matter what we actually do 
fortunately it is always possible to turn the tables provided we keep a tight frame and change these emotions as well for example when we are weak we should elicit empathy be noticed for our good intentions or noble infirmities and when we are strong we should elicit admiration and trust
think frame feel positive about us and about what we do get rid of those who wont

 you have no idea how much you are eating 
ever wonder why you cant gain any muscle or lose any body fat well the first place to look for the answer is your diet are you eating the requisite amount of calories for your goals if you want to gain muscle you have to eat more calories than you burn whereas if you want to lose body fat you have to eat fewer calories than you burn there is no way around this simple fact even though this is nothing more than a grade school physics problem im still baffled by the number of guys out there whining about being hardgainers or endomorphs invest in a food scale and track your intake its really not that hard 
 you are constantly looking for the next best supplement to take 
this is the game equivalent of asking for the one magic pick up line that will allow you to swoop top shelf girls left and right the hard truth is that the vast majority of supplements are a complete waste of money guys flock to supplements because its an easy fix instead of putting in the time and hard work needed to obtain the results they desire they look for shortcuts in order to get ahead unfortunately these shortcuts dont exist the only time you should be worrying about supplements is when you have all of the other nutritional building blocks in place 
 you think you dont have the time to eat healthy 
a lot of guys complain about being too busy to eat nutritious meals made mostly of whole foods guys will also complain about not having enough time to hit the gym after work or during their lunch break the problem here is not one of time  but rather of priorities  guys would rather sleepin than get up early to make themselves a good lunch to take to work the bottom line is this if you value your health then find the time to make yourself nutritious meals ditch the excuses 
 you think there is one best diet for everyone 
ive been in this game long enough to know that there is no one particular diet that is best for everyone i remember about  years ago people were losing their minds over the atkins diet about  years later people moved on to the paleo diet and now intermittent fasting is all the rage new diets will always be on the horizon which pretty much guarantees that arguments on the internet about which diet is the best will never end i do not know what the best diet is what i do know is that all good diets have several things in common such as being based around whole foods and acknowledging the importance of portion control protein fiber and other important nutrients aside from these basics whether you eat low carb or high carb three meals a day or six meal is entirely up to you and your lifestyle but make sure you get the basics down first 
if you can get a handle on just these four areas of your nutrition you will be ahead of the vast majority of individuals out there",2016-10-27
1178,no title,"the most interesting books of the bible for those who arent believers in god are the wisdom books of job and ecclesiastes written from a philosophical point of view they attempt to help people live with suffering and pain while putting existence into context
book of job 
job is a devout believer in god who follows all of his rules he has been blessed with incredible wealth and numerous children satan then challenges god by arguing that job is only faithful because of what he has gained and that he would immediately curse god if everything was taken away from him god allows satan to destroy him taking his wealth and killing all of his children
once the misfortune befalls job his wife implores him to curse god but job refuses instead he openly laments at why god is allowing him to suffer he even asks god to allow him to die
i would rather be strangled
rather die than suffer like this
i hate my life and dont want to go on living
oh leave me alone for my few remaining days job 
why make me your target
am i a burden to you
why not just forgive my sin
and take away my guilt
for soon i will lie down in the dust and die
when you look for me i will be gone job 
what do you gain by oppressing me
why do you reject me the work of your own hands
while smiling on the schemes of the wicked job 
he then has a series of poetic dialogues with priestly men in an attempt to explain gods justice job asks some pointed questions implying that those who are eager to sin seem to experience more prosperity than those who closely follow gods words
the godless seem like a lush plant growing in the sunshine
its branches spreading across the garden
its roots grow down through a pile of stones
it takes hold on a bed of rocks
but when it is uprooted
its as though it never existed job 
when a plague sweeps through
he laughs at the death of the innocent
the whole earth is in the hands of the wicked
and god blinds the eyes of the judges
if hes not the one who does it who is job 
just like how there are so many laws in the legal code that you are always on the hook for something illegal there are also so many possible sins that it may be impossible to live a clean life
whatever happens i will be found guilty
so whats the use of trying
even if i were to wash myself with soap
and clean my hands with lye
you would plunge me into a muddy ditch
and my own filthy clothing would hate me job 
the men that job spills his guts to state that hes sinning in some way and knows nothing about how god works and that he must grin and bear it instead of questioning gods actions
pay attention to this job
stop and consider the wonderful miracles of god
do you know how god controls the storm
and causes the lightning to flash from his clouds
do you understand how he moves the clouds
with wonderful perfection and skill
when you are sweltering in your clothes
and the south wind dies down and everything is still
he makes the skies reflect the heat like a bronze mirror
can you do that job 
god appears and asks job how dare he question his actions even though those actions amounted to an agreement with satan
who is this that questions my wisdom
with such ignorant words
brace yourself like a man
because i have some questions for you
and you must answer them
where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth
tell me if you know so much
who determined its dimensions
and stretched out the surveying line
what supports its foundations
and who laid its cornerstone
as the morning stars sang together
and all the angels shouted for joy job 
god goes on to describe his powers and then serves a how dare you argument to job who then accepts his utter impotence
then the lord said to job
do you still want to argue with the almighty
you are gods critic but do you have the answers
then job replied to the lord
i am nothinghow could i ever find the answers
i will cover my mouth with my hand
i have said too much already
i have nothing more to say job 
you asked who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorance
it is iand i was talking about things i knew nothing about
things far too wonderful for me
you said listen and i will speak
i have some questions for you
and you must answer them
i had only heard about you before
but now i have seen you with my own eyes
i take back everything i said
and i sit in dust and ashes to show my repentance job 
other parts of the bible channel job by asking why bad on earth is allowed to continue
wake up o lord why do you sleep
get up do not reject us forever
why do you look the other way
why do you ignore our suffering and oppression
we collapse in the dust
lying face down in the dirt
rise up help us
ransom us because of your unfailing love psalm 
and the usual response is to not question god
what sorrow awaits those who argue with their creator
does a clay pot argue with its maker
does the clay dispute with the one who shapes it saying
stop youre doing it wrong
does the pot exclaim
how clumsy can you be
how terrible it would be if a newborn baby said to its father
why was i born
or if it said to its mother
why did you make me this way isaiah 
after job stopped questioning god he was rewarded with even greater prosperity than before
so the lord blessed job in the second half of his life even more than in the beginning for now he had  sheep  camels  teams of oxen and  female donkeys he also gave job seven more sons and three more daughters he named his first daughter jemimah the second keziah and the third kerenhappuch in all the land no women were as lovely as the daughters of job and their father put them into his will along with their brothers job lived  years after that living to see four generations of his children and grandchildren then he died an old man who had lived a long full life job 
you have to be patient with god
those who plant in tears will harvest with shouts of joy they weep as they go to plant their seed but they sing as they return with the harvest psalm 
the lesson of this story seems to be one of stoicism accept your fate dont question it and understand that what you have now can be taken from you at a moments notice if god wants to no matter how cleanly you have lived in his honor ironically this book did more to make me question gods wisdom than any other
book of ecclesiastes 
the next wisdom book is ecclesiastes purportedly written by kings david son solomon who amassed onethousand wives during his reign as king of israel his wife collection led to him serving other gods and he was punished for it when god broke up the kingdom of israel ecclesiastes is the book that solomon wrote at the end of his life sharing all that he learned
everything is meaningless says the teacher completely meaningless what do people get for all their hard work under the sun generations come and generations go but the earth never changes the sun rises and the sun sets then hurries around to rise again the wind blows south and then turns north around and around it goes blowing in circles rivers run into the sea but the sea is never full then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea everything is wearisome beyond description no matter how much we see we are never satisfied no matter how much we hear we are not content history merely repeats itself it has all been done before nothing under the sun is truly new ecclesiastes 
what is the point of accumulating wisdom in life why work hard
for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow ecclesiastes 
i thought wisdom is better than foolishness just as light is better than darkness for the wise can see where they are going but fools walk in the dark yet i saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate both will die so i said to myself since i will end up the same as the fool whats the value of all my wisdom this is all so meaningless for the wise and the foolish both die ecclesiastes 
so what do people get in this life for all their hard work and anxiety their days of labor are filled with pain and grief even at night their minds cannot rest it is all meaningless ecclesiastes 
all is vanity
for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts even one thing befalleth them as the one dieth so dieth the other yea they have all one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast for all is vanity all go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust again ecclesiastes 
promiscuous and bad women are sent forth as a punishment from god
i discovered that a seductive woman is a trap more bitter than death her passion is a snare and her soft hands are chains those who are pleasing to god will escape her but sinners will be caught in her snare ecclesiastes 
solomon tries to convince himself that evil will not prosper but he cant help coming back to the fact that it does
when a crime is not punished quickly people feel it is safe to do wrong but even though a person sins a hundred times and still lives a long time i know that those who fear god will be better off the wicked will not prosper for they do not fear god their days will never grow long like the evening shadows and this is not all that is meaningless in our world in this life good people are often treated as though they were wicked and wicked people are often treated as though they were good this is so meaningless ecclesiastes 
at this moment it seems that solomon goes off the rails by seemingly promoting a life of debauchery
so i recommend having fun because there is nothing better for people in this world than to eat drink and enjoy life that way they will experience some happiness along with all the hard work god gives them under the sun ecclesiastes 
one interpretation of this is that if you live in sin like solomon you will eventually come to the conclusion that life is meaningless all is for naught and the only purpose is to have fun the book may have been included in the bible to serve as an example of what will happen to you if behave as solomon and come to the end of your life thinking that it wasnt worth it i hope this was the intended result because otherwise it would cause you to lose faith in gods own wisdom in justice just like with job
the wisdom books of the bible raise questions of gods justice and plans for his human subjects why do people suffer or prosper why does life feel like its not being guided by god these questions vexed the jews enough that they honored other gods to get more immediate results and then jesus christ came along to say that it will all be worth itnot necessarily now but in the eternal afterlife as long as you accept him as your savior

1179,video rude cnn reporter asks trump why hes taking time off to open a hotel,"ive been living in south east asia for almost a decade now and over that time ive come to have a matured perspective on living here and a fair appreciation of the pros and cons of doing so like most people who come here i set off thinking i was going to live in paradise thats far from the reality let me tell you
living in south east asia has its pros and cons just like anywhere else while i myself have decided to return west for a while ill always have a connection to asia and im sure ill be back many times throughout my life
so whats the real story with living in asia is it all its cracked up to be what does a man have to be aware of when coming here lets look at six common stereotypical ideas about living in south east asia and assess them in the light of reality
 asian women are kind gentle and compliant to their husbands so sweet not so fast
this is most definitely a myth and if you come out here expecting to find some little house pet who does your bidding youll be in for a rude awakening
its definitely true that asian women in my experience are a lot more traditional they give the man his place in the house rarely question your final decisions and do not resent housework and basic wifely duties
however the idea that theyll just do whatever you tell them without question is nonsense theyre human beings with a will of their own and you wouldnt be the first guy to get a smack in the head from a fivefoottwo broad who weighs  pounds if you disrespect her
the idea that asian women are some sort of angelic alternative to western women is also nonsense while its not the norm ive met several western men who have been taken to the cleaners by their asian wives and girlfriends when you move here youre completely at her mercy and you will never have any legal rights as a citizen
asian women generally are a lot more traditional but this stereotype that theyre some sort of perfect wife material has got to go theyre individualsand there are all kinds good and bad among them
read this guide to dating asian women for a more complete perspective on the issue its a thorny subject and theres a lot of misunderstanding surrounding it
 asia is ridiculously cheap 
this is one id have to lean slightly towards agreeing with
most things in asia are a lot cheaper eating out for my entire family often costs less than  meaning i can afford to do it basically every day my rent for a condo apartment costs less than  a month although thats mostly because i live in the sticks and am not in a major city
a general rule of thumb is that outside of major cities like bangkok singapore and kl you can divide the cost of living by three and get a rough estimate
note this does not apply to consumer goods such as cars and electrical appliances which are in and around the same price it certainly does not apply to luxury goods which are often much more expensive because of the taxes placed on them by local governments
asia is cheaper overall but anything other than the basics costs roughly the same life in south east asia can be cheaper but it isnt necessarily soit depends on your lifestyle
 you can become a citizen of an asian country and stay forever becoming a citizen in an asian country is nigh on impossible even if you could you probably wouldnt want to
you can get a variety of visas like permanent residency and each country aims to facilitate the spouses of their nationals and especially retirees with proven cash in the bank however youll not become a citizen with all of the various rights they enjoy
its also worth noting while you might get permanent residence youll never be one of them even if you live here for  years you will always be a foreigner and will be viewed as such by locals this has pros and cons to it but youll never quite feel at home and accepted as one of the group
youll get undue respect from some for being a westerner but forget about talking politics or leveling criticisms at the way things are doneyoull be met with hostility and resentment for the latter
 the weather in asia is  sunshine 
the weather in south east asia is generally pretty awesome and you can live an outdoors life youll truly enjoy if youre that type
the sun shines almost every day and even when its overcast its warm meaning you can go out and about and do anything from walk on the beach to shop in the city
however when the storms come youd better be prepared to get your ass inside the rainfall and wind in many countries in south east asia is truly terrifying just switch on any news station the next time a major storm hits the philippines and youll see what its like
thankfully after  years of living in the philippines  ive never been caught directly in a major storm although ive seen the tail end of plenty of them
the weather is good when its good and utterly awful when its bad check this clip out to see how bad it can get

 asia is  years behind the west in terms of development 
this is a stereotype thats deeply mistaken and whether or not its true depends on which country you go to
true countries like laos and bangladesh are miles behind any western nation but head to singapore and youll be shocked by how far ahead of us they are in terms of tech and development
asia is developing at breakneck pace and with that development comes super highways skytrains skyscrapers and everything else we usually associate with an advanced country it wont be long before many countries out here catch up and surpass the west although it is definitely true that most of them are slightly behind for now
theres a phenomenon called leapfrogging which virtually guarantees asian countries will catch up to and surpass the west quickly leapfrogging is when they can skip all of the evolution and development and simply emulate modern day technology developed elsewherea great example is india where they have skipped the transition from dialup to mobie internet and gone straight from nothing to mobile
if you think this cant be done and there are intellectual property laws to protect tech from being stolen wholesale i salute you but i have to laugh there are no such laws and even if there were nobody would bother to enforce them
on the other hand you still have many scenes like this outside your window when you get out of the main cities

 asians are extremely family oriented again this is one i lean towards agreeing with there are exceptions to every rule but the family unit is extremely strong in asia especially countries like the philippines
i dont want to wax lyrical or speculate as to why this is its enough to acknowledge it as a fact and accept that its the case  of the asian people i have ever met and gotten to know from indonesia to the philippines to thailand are devoted to their families to the extent that wed consider it cultlike in most western countries
i pass no judgment on this whatsoever it can be a great thing or a bad thing depending on your own perspective i personally like it and think its something weve lost in many european countries and america too
this is an idea about asia i agree withthe dedication to family above individuality is definitely true and so by default if you get into a relationship with an asian woman be prepared for this
the family unit is the sun around which everything orbits in most asian countries
living in asia summary sorry to disappoint you fellas but you wont find paradise in south east asia
what you will find is a place with many opportunities pitfalls pros and cons but which i do not regret living in for a single second and which has come to be a large part of my lifes story
i came out for a year and stayed for almost a decade however ive decided that time is now over and its time to go home
id love to hear about your experiences living or traveling in asia do you find my perceptions to be accurate or do you have a different view

1180,aig quadruples limits for terrorism insurance to  billion,"home this month popular  ridiculously stupid things men keep doing for women  ridiculously stupid things men keep doing for women david g brown 
david is a lifelong dissident and intellectual rebel he despises political correctness which replaces real needy victims with narcissistic leftists out for a free meal though still a young man he has watched society descend into its present morass with great sadness combined with a determination to help make things better he tweets when theres something worth tweeting here  october   girls 
forget the movies that set aloof men against loveseeking women it is men who are the hopeless romantics much if not most of the time and they express this extraordinary naivety by engaging in stupid behaviors that their fathers and other male role models should have beaten out of them though feminism demographic trends and socioeconomic realities encourage women to be entitled prima donnas men add to the feedback loop by rewarding modernday princesses 
of course there are sensible exceptions to avoiding the following behaviors a time and a place for example can be found for defending a woman most notably your mother or wife from someone elses verbal or physical attack likewise sometimes emergencies or certain serious events mean you should put your priorities aside to help a highquality woman who gives longterm value to your life that said in the vast majority of cases acting in this way is unnecessary timeconsuming resourcedraining and plain selfdestructive for a man 
so here are the five things many men perversely and uselessly keep doing for women  fighting for them 
i lost count long ago of the number of times i have seen a man step in to save a woman from either herself or a slight usually deserved against her a girl will behave like a pork chop at a restaurant club or elsewhere picking a verbal or even physical argument with an employee or fellow patron along comes captainsaveaho who might not even know the girl to protect her honor the expectation of many women that men will do this for them is bad enough let alone when a man does it of his own volition without being requested 
in return for risking a physical or similar altercation with other people the white knight invariably gets a smile a few words and perhaps a phone number from this point onwards though the interaction between mr white knight and the entitled damsel who causes her own distress invariably fizzles out and it is not just members of your typical white knight crowd who act this way men who are nominally good with women fall into this trap too confusing it with the opportunity to be alpha and dominate over another male the most common outcome sadly is that a womans very poor behavior is condoned by a man falling over himself to be her medieval champion  fighting over them not only is this bickering usually illadvised it is often exactly what she wants 
this stupid behavior is only marginally better than fighting for women and the two activities consistently overlap whilst competition in life including between men over women should be largely encouraged swathes of men are effectively scrapping over last sundays leftovers on a saturday three days after the refrigerator stopped working 
remember a woman can be attractive but because of her attitude and behavior have very little longterm value for you countless men live with the illusion that if they toil hard enough to get the goodlooking girl it must be worth it thats simply not the case in modern times to boot a lot of sexually thirsty men nowadays are chasing physically lowyield women their fathers and grandfathers would never have noticed 
at best the majority of men who fight over women are dueling over the prospect of snaring a girl who one of them will probably fuck a few times if at all and if they do manage to secure the girl for a longterm relationship the pairing usually implodes down the track the man either realizes he wasted his time or suffers greatly in material terms such as by being draped divorce raped 
in the meantime the girls being fought over have their egos stroked time and time again unattractive girls see themselves as attractive and attractive girls with foul entitled princess personalities find themselves validated once more everything in these situations is predicated on the men fighting and proving themselves rather than the women reaching an appropriate standard of physical and emotional femininity  paying for them what are you getting from the transaction with her and yes everything is transactional in malefemale relationships 
unless you are completely sure you have claimed the worlds best girl for yourself and even that belief is probably based on very false or temporary appearances you should ideally be investing less financially in the relationship than she is this may seem counterintuitive especially when a man is sexually valued by women for his status achievements and resources but we are not living in a time when almost every woman is marriageable a man providing for a woman can only justify it if she is of highquality and gives him something back in return on both these counts most men are paying for dud deals 
in every longterm relationship i have had i have put less into the relationship financially proportionallyspeaking almost always even the girls gross investment has either approximated mine or surpassed it for dates and during casual relationships too i pay for a womans time about as much as she pays for mine if not less 
when relationships end girls can and do play petty games over money or property you may be owed what matters however is how you conduct yourself overall only when a woman has materially invested in you or invests in you should you invest in her when patriarchy returns the malefemale dynamic will alter before that time be sure she does her fair share financially  shifting or sacrificing their priorities for them meanwhile he should be do everything else for himself 
unlike many other selfdestructive behaviors concerning women this one can be very incremental and hard to spot it is very easy to procrastinate on your work final exams selfdevelopment goals and the rest of your social life when what you feel is a highquality woman comes along in fact nature has basically designed you to do that by throwing your biochemistry into a druglike dependency at the beginning of a courtship in addition to these problems early on men are apt to continue the shelving of their other more personal demands after the relationship is well established 
on a topic i will explore in more detail in another article there should be certain hours in many days or simply days in general in which women do not even enter your mind contrast this with your average man who will throw away opportunities to further himself to please his girl and often shes not his girl for much longer as his neglect of himself becomes apparent in her less attracted mind by devoting yourself to a ho you become dispensable to a ho not just psychologically but physically financially and socially as well dont let yourself rot 
your body finances education and other forms of selfimprovement need to be your number one focus after all they are the only things you have or dont have  hours a day  days a year individual girls may come and go but your obligations to yourself remain paradoxically keeping these obligations to yourself are what attract girls in the first place a man who takes proper care of his money career body and social life gets women  moving to them for them sucker 
this is the one even my leftwing father warned me about but its something a lot of guys are yet to learn like shifting or sacrificing ones priorities moving to a girl for a girl is conducive to throwing your own needs into utter disarray every time i moved to where a girl of mine lived i did so mostly for myself whether to explore a new country for three months or find a new refreshing place to get my work done the relocation benefited me this is qualitatively far different from upending yourself to some new city for the mere chance to thrive and the desire to please a girl 
perhaps the saddest thing about the man who moves for his girl is that when he wants even a fraction of the favor he gave her hes often left in the lurch dont make this mistake either she must move to you or you move to her for a lot of reasons that dont revolve around her if the relationship fails and most of them do you leave yourself in an equal or better position than the one you would otherwise be in dont follow the crowd of thirsty males too many men slave away in a female desert girls are not nonexistent but theyre too often lowquality relative to what a man is willing to do for them 
snap yourself out of these behaviors and help your friends shake them off too you may not indulge in them regularly but the temptation to perform them at least sometimes is likely to be there more broadly we need to see a seismic shift in the way many men act become part of the solution 
so whats just as bad as an entitled woman a man who encourages her entitlement with obsequious validation",2016-10-26
1181,no title,"alain soral is an influential frenchswiss thinker author and filmmaker his beliefs are summarized as french third position basically a third party for those that reject the traditional left and right political views and there have been third position movements in many european countries over the past several decades
major beliefs of sorals ideology include nationalism political sovereignty social conservatism antiglobalism antiimmigration antifeminism antibankster and a noninterventionist antiwar foreign policy a major slogan of third position is reconciliation between the labor left and the values righteconomic policy which values individual work and labor and social policy focused on nationalism and traditionalism
early life 
alain soral was born in  in southeastern france he attended a wellregarded private catholic school before enrolling in the distinguished national school of fine arts in paris founded in  and later transferred to study under the philosopher and economist cornelius castoriadis a famous th century thinker
castoriadis 
castoriadis favored autonomous societies that are selfaware of their autonomy and independence and believed societies should provide legitimacy for their laws and government actions historically this was often done through absolute monarchy by invoking religion and god with the monarch having a direct connection to the almighty what god has commanded is what we must institute with the law
modern capitalist societies proved their legitimacy through circular tautology that is they claimed that capitalism was logical and just and therefore whatever a capitalistic society deemed profitable was therefore logical and just a just autonomous society was always questioning and challenging its laws but at the same time adhering to respecting and upholding the law
castoriadis described modern society as a struggle between creative imaginary and capitalist imaginary
the repetition of empty forms of conformism apathy irresponsibility and cynicism at the same time as it is that of the tightening grip of the capitalist imaginary of unlimited expansion of rational mastery pseudorational pseudomastery of an unlimited expansion of consumption for the sake of consumption that is to say for nothing and of a technoscience that has become autonomized along its path and that is evidently involved in the domination of this capitalist imaginary the other road should be opened it is not at all laid out it can be opened only through a social and political awakening a resurgence of the project of individual and collective autonomy that is to say of the will to freedom this would require an awakening of the imagination and of the creative imaginary
postuniversity 
soral loved books and knowledge studying radicals from throughout the political spectrum he was a dragueur de rue street pickup artist when the pua movement was virtually unknown he developed a skill at attracting young narcissistic valueless city girls and claimed to bed hundreds of women and published a book on game in  his experiences with these women led him to develop strong antifeminist beliefs
he developed a strong dislike for the french bobosbourgeois bohemians younger wealthy highly educated narcissistic hedonists interested in fashion and trends perhaps something like rich hipsters but less retro more fashionable and trendy
he joined the french communist party motivated by his dislike of the bobos and his camaraderie with the working man the communist party along with the front national were among the few opponents of the creation of the eu soral studied the works of marx and other marxists before leaving to join the far right front national where he was a speechwriter for marie le pen he noted that both communists and front national members were strongly nationalistic and indeed many workers left the communist party to join fn around this time

he became a strong critic of feminism and minority politics gay feminist and islamist or other racial multicultural groups after front national performed poorly in the  elections he formed equality and reconciliation  seeking to consolidate ideas on the left and right who believed in nationalism patriarchy anticommunism antiimmigration and antizionism er is an alternative news site with some tendencies to the american altright pronationalist and critical of modern culture and feminism he describes it as left for the workers and right for morals
he is a boxer and since  has coached boxing he records videos has a regular feature naming the cunt of the month and his works and website are very popular despite harsh attacks against him in the mainstream media
summary of views trolling a feminist
not much is available in english of soral and even english subtitles on his many videos are hard to find i have but a cursory understanding of french so i have relied on secondary sources and translations his major beliefs are
antifeminism views feminism as not prowork as women have always worked but instead as antifamily and antimother discusses two classes of feminists freaks and bitches the real struggle is between rich and poor not man and woman who are naturally attracted to each other he has attacked womens magazines as altering the social conscience and relegating women to the status of objects stresses selfimprovement and virility in men
anticapitalism and anticonsumerism opposed to valueless consumption and consumerism in favor of banksterfree economics and an end to the nanny state opposes desire society and the cult of celebrity
antiimperialism opposed to the globalist empire and american imperialism attempting to spread its cultural ideological economic social views everywhere and to destroy all nationstates
antizionism has attacked jewish lobbying and intervention in french affairs made statements criticizing the jewish people for being ostracized in societies around the world throughout history which earned him an immediate and harsh media blackout he makes a distinction between french jews and zionism saying that zionists are opposing the interests of france and french jews
anticommunitarianism favors nationalism not communitarianism calls communitarianism a poison opposed to ethnic racial sexual islamist or feminist communitarianism which is opposed to morality and national standards opposes the public effeminate homo and transsexual society and laments the lack of strong male role models makes a strong distinction between homosexuality and the gay pride community movement which promotes drag queens parties vulgar parades and hypersexualization
antivulgarity opposes vulgar language dress and speech especially in women has said he prefers publicly wearing the muslim veil to thong underwear would go crazy at a slutwalk critic of profanity and vulgarity proponent of morality and modesty
islam feels the menace of islam is an artificially created and manipulated threat primitive islamic society is not a real threat to modern western states and capitalistic globalist interests manipulate the region to destroy the antiglobalist antifeminist culture of islam to foster animosity between social groups to possibly create a clash of civilizations or world war leading to a full globalist takeover and to loot mideast nations and that the fundamental values of moderate islam are perfectly compatible with french moderate catholic views
antimodern culture and mainstream media opposed to the decline in western values and culture and the sorry state of mainstream media who has labeled him a pariah

1182,glp forum godlike productions,"disclaimer this is not legal advice if you are charged with a criminal offense or think that you may be contact your attorney 
if you are a western man under  your world view when it comes to sex was forged in the era of internet pornography epic divorce rates hypersexualized television content and a political climate of anything goes sexual identity at virtually any age you could be forgiven for thinking that when you first had sex with your sweetheart back in high school or earlier it wasnt something remarkable and youve both probably forgotten about it years later you could also be one accusation away from defending yourself in a sex offense case
while american culture evolved or as many fairly and convincingly argue de volved into a sexually open environment where there are few if any societal and legal restrictions beyond those involving children and animals statutory rape is still caught in a complex patchwork of state based laws
federal law does not stipulate a universal age of consent instead leaving it to the states to codify though you are safe everywhere in north america by avoiding all girls under  and you may think thats the law of the land federal statutes principally refer to matters surrounding pornographic material and prostitution by the wayyou didnt take any naked selfies or make a homemade porno with her right good thing you didnt because you could have violated that federal law about pornography 
what is the age of consent in america i wouldnt even trust her fake id
the age for private consensual sexual acts in america ranges from  to   sometimes lower in the case of married couples its even lower in some foreign countries by the way say youre an american student overseas with a foreign girlfriend whos legal in her country but still under you might want to check with a knowledgable lawyer before getting down a d dirty
why is this significant for starters the un convention on the rights of the child considers anyone under the age of  to be a child that magic number is also used to prosecute anyone going overseas with the intent to have sex with a minor while us law in this area is aimed at pedophiles and traffickers theres no reason it could not be applied to a young man on a trip to cancun or studying abroad in eastern europe the most likely situation for a young american male will be domestic however
dont take one for the team
for example back when you were  and your girlfriend was  and the age of consent in your state was  you might have both been well aware of what you were doing and done it several timesperhaps even with the knowledge and approval of your parents you may have stayed with her for years and eventually got married but more than likely you and she parted ways and havent looked back since
till one day you get a knock at your door from a policeman who wants to question you about your relationship a few years earlier thinking nothing of it you tell him the basic details admitting to sexual contact and bam you are arrested for statutory rape of a minor any defense of her consenting multiple times or even that you did not know she was underage is irrelevantas a minor she cannot consent and because of this she may have no say in whether or not to press charges
the long arm of the law may reach you 
well thats no bother to me since it was so long ago and the statute of limitations passed anyway right not so fast first if you have amassed any assets years later she could still decide to sue you in civil court for damages although this is not always successful  and either win at trial or eke out a monetary settlement from you even absent a criminal conviction or a civil court judgement against you having to pay a settlement for a sex assault related case is something no man wants on his resume just ask bill clinton 
moreover just because it is now beyond the statute of limitations for prosecuting you do not assume you are in the clear statutes of limitations can be changed  once again including accused offenders even though they were previously beyond the statute of limitations any statements you may have made to law enforcement before this happens would once again be fair game
while the intent of changes to these laws is noblethey want to nail child abusers who got away for decadesthe reality is you can get scooped up into the mix if you as a teenager once had a sexual encounter of any kind with an underage girl perhaps even if you yourself were underage if you think you engaged in a situation where you could be charged the best course of action is to clam up and consult lawyer in your jurisdiction
this applies even more if one day you are approached by anyone and out of the blue they bring up the subject even though youd nearly forgotten about it if you get arrested and charged but the prosecuting attorney decides to not prosecute continue to keep quiet regardless prosecutors come and go and a replacement with a political agenda could perhaps decide to reopen your case and pursue charges
branded for life 
if you get charged but by some miracle are able to cop a plea and get probation with no jail time you will probably still wind up in a sex offender registry  perhaps for life say you get luckier still and serious doubts surface about the veracity of the story and eventually the charges are reduced or dropped completely resulting in no conviction and no sex offender registry requirement for you well guess what you will still have an arrest record for a sex offense on your rap sheetit matters not that there was no conviction
imagine driving down the road years later a cop drives up behind you and automatically scans your license plate as is now common practice a sex offense arrest pops up think you stand a good chance of getting pulled over for further scrutiny what are the chances youre going away with a warning instead of a ticket that day for better or worse cop instinct is to view arrests the same as they would a conviction so its best to keep all arrests completely out of your life as much as possible
you will get no breaks so watch yourself and stfu yes of course you both knew what you were doing back on prom night and yes we know grown women teachers who have sex with minors often are convicted at trial and still receive no jail sentences  but you sir are a heterosexual man acting out on your urges and therefore a prime targetdoubly so if youre white nonislamic and attending college or boarding school particularly a prestigious institution  forewarned is forearmed
young men need to be well aware of the laws in their state before engaging in any sexual contact in situations where they could face a statutory rape accusation and if youve got a story or two from back in your glory days as the high school quarterback with the freshman cheerleader dont tell that story to anyone ever the political climate is not favorable to youand it could stay that way for a while absent a much needed reality check

the idea that feminism is dead is gaining ground all across the west one would like to think it is because of the trail blazing of the manosphere and to a great degree it is but truly the root of feminisms death was in man capital m from the very beginning one look at conan is all a man needs to know this truth 
feminism is dead the movement is absolutely dead 
the womens movement tried to suppress dissident voices for way too long theres no room for dissent its just like mean girls 
if they had listened to me they could have gotten the ship steered in the right direction my wing of feminismthe prosex wingwas silenced i was practically lynched for endorsing the rolling stones susan faludi is still saying im not a feminist who made her pope 
feminist ideology is like a new religion for a lot of neurotic women you cant talk to them about anything 
 camille paglia on rob ford rihanna and rape culture for macleansca 
neurotic women indeed 
paul joseph watson of infowarsprison planet fame was bang on in his assessment of feminism at the end of  but he may have underestimated his conclusions in my opinion feminists did not just lose the debate they lost the war 
the feminist attempt to demonize normal malefemale behaviour in public men initiating contact with a female with a hello and attempt to strike up a conversation backfired in less than a month 
when you have a woman volunteer to walk down the street as princess leia the queen of s patriarchal sexist misogyny to ridicule feminists you have lost the war for hearts and minds 
and when i say hearts and minds i mean the silent majority of young women who want nothing to do with feminism 
leia makes it clear in this video that boys will be boys so too will jawas darth vader and even yoda apparently that sly dude who knew 
and thats a good thing men and women are meant to interact and engage in romantic courtship feminists may hate this but the vast majority of women still prefer and expect the man to take the initiative to get the girl this is how men and women were created and evolved you cant fight darwin and god and come out on top 
this video shows that the majority of normal women love male attention they want men to look at them they want men to notice them why 
they want a man 
i realized this is the case when i decided to google the fast rising phenomenon of women against feminism  
this image from the women against feminism tumblr page really hits home the loss for feminism this woman was raped she is not running around spreading lies like the uva rape hoax story that rolling stone ran and had to retract  she justs wants to go back to living a normal life she does not want to be angry at all men for the crime of one of them she does not want to demonize all men in some sad attempt to get revenge she does not want to be a victim feminists have lost the female youth of millenials the very generation that is supposed to obliterate the patriarchy completely in the st century 
i understand some men who are still angry over feminism may proclaim these women are doing nothing more than crying for sympathy and attention now that millenial men have become vocal blunt and merciless in their attacks against feminism and the current generation of women it has reared  the problem with this type of kneejerk reaction is just thatyoure being a jerk yes far too many western women for comfort are no good for a relationship anymore but that does not also translate into there being no young women who are not just as frustrated and angry at feminism as you are and the feminists who claim to speak for them 
young women might not think about it as much since feminism has clearly made the road to independence an illusion easier for them to choose but these women are taking note that men are completely ignoring them now that they have surpassed men in almost all aspects of western society 
case in point 
i met a wonderful young russian blonde a little while back twentythree tight feminine so freaking perfect we hit it off immediately on first contact having myself only traveled outside the west twice i still primarily meet foreign women in my own country and every time i do i am blown away by their immediate friendliness and ease in my company compared to western girls as i conversed with this well educated and refined young russian lady she told me she was attending university and so naturally i asked her what she noticed most about the boys on campus compared to back home 
her answer was revealing boys they completely ignore the girls dont even look at them just walk on by 
this really surprised her being a feminine russian girl who expects men to look at women this behaviour by western men was completely alien to her 
men young boys in their prime s completely ignoring women on campus as they go about their day 
according to wikipedia women against feminism started on tumblr in   i see womenagainstfeminism as a sign that many young women are fed up with feminism and male bashing in western society it is not a sign of women speaking with two faces and trying to work both sides of the gender war to their advantage all you have to do is look into the eyes of this young woman to know just how desperate these girls are for a real relationship one with love and respect  i dont think men realize how significant a movement like women against feminism is 
as men we are naturally comfortable with open conflict and expressing not just dissenting but offensive opinions the very existence of women openly declaring they are rejecting feminism and risking social ostracism in a wholly feminist dominated university climate is why feminists are hyperventilating and going into apeshit mentally insane overdrive mode to try and salvage what support they have left  here are just a few mainstream articles trying to push the meme feminism is not dead and just needs a generational adjustment",2016-10-27
1184,netflix and pill streaming firm boss reveals the future of tv could be a matrixstyle hallucinatory drug,"in a previous article  i discussed stretchingnamely why stretching is important for the masculine man and several stretches that you should use in your training to maximize your physical fitness and while that advice is still valid i neglected a very important concept in that first article the techniques that detail how to stretch
i am not referring to a specific stretch or some sort of hypothetical stretching mindset but rather a set of techniques that can be utilized for any stretch to increase ones flexibility immediately but before i can discuss those i have to discuss the incorrect way of stretching that many people still use
how not to stretch many people believe that stretching is a literal act of forcing the muscles and connective tissue to stretch avoid this at all costs  first and foremost as i have discussed previously in these pages you should never apply any stretching pressure to the connective tissue they evolved solely to hold fast and keep things in one piece they should never be stretched at all
the muscles are the anatomical feature that stretches as they evolved to do when stretching your body should always be positioned in a way where the connective tissues are stable and the muscles are moving
even when you are positioned properly no part of stretching should involve the athlete forcing his muscles to stretch as that risks muscular tearing which is a nagging injury that never truly goes away this is because the human body has naturally evolved what is referred to as the  antistretch reflex  to prevent muscular tearingstretching the muscles increases in difficulty the farther and deeper the stretch is and your body responds to this stress with pain this is a biological sign telling you that if you go further youll be risking muscle tears and should normally be a heeded warning
however if you want to do advanced stretching such as that nighimpossible benchmark of fitness the splits you will have to find a way to overcome this reflex without hurting yourself and as luck would have it there is

relax into stretching reflexes can be overcome with gradual and repeated practicejust ask your friendly neighborhood hooker about how she overcame her gag reflex similarly your antistretch reflex that keeps your joints actually your muscles stiff and immobile can be overcome with a few techniques
the most basic of these techniques is the one that i have had the best results with as usual the simple but difficult answer is usually the correct one and that is the titular concept of relaxing into a stretchwith thanks to pavel tsatsouline for naming the concept
to use this technique take an easy form of the stretch you want to do using the splits as an example you would do a seated groin stretch engage the stretch just to the point where you feel tension in the target muscle and thensit and wait

yes paradoxically relaxation is the key to increasing your physical fitness in this context you are literally going to sit there and wait for your muscles to stop fighting the stretchin other words youre going to exhaust your reflex until it stops being reflexive
this is not something that happens quicklyfrom my experience it will take  minutes per stretch so it is perfectly acceptable for you to get a book or watch tv while doing this as a side note this is literally the only time where its acceptable to have a visual distraction during exercise in my opinion
as you might expect once your muscles have relaxed and the pain has melted away you can increase the stretch a little bit more and hold it for another  minutes repeat this process until your muscles are in pain and you judge that you cant go any furtherthis is a personal call that you will have to decide for yourself as i cant judge when your muscles are demanding you to stop
this technique can be utilized for any stretch and in many cases will give you the progress that you so desire however there are other methods in the relax into stretch family of exercises that can be utilized as well such as meditationmentally relaxing will lead to muscular relaxation
or you can try forced relaxation where you flex the muscle simultaneously while stretching forcing the muscle to relax

either way you slice it dont just brute force your stretching utilize these techniques for better results

1185,republicans in congress are ready for hillary as they prepare for new probes into clinton foundation,"how population growth industrial agriculture and environmental pollution may have weakened society how population growth industrial agriculture and environmental pollution may have weakened society 
a determined young man with a strong sense of his destiny  to save his country from postmodern collapse october   culture 
the global population in  was about one billion people today it stands at over seven times that amount with the rapidly growing populations of india and africa expected to increase that to at least nine billion over the coming years readers today are well used to the idea that the global south is densely populated relative to its economic size and area but this was not always the case prior to the collapse of empire europe having undergone thorough industrialization was the most densely populated continent in the world source the world at six billion united nations   un dept of economic and social affairs population division  
europe was also where the worlds social justice movementsliberalism communism and feminismbegan overthrowing the old order of kings castes and courtship with the vulgar and degenerate world we suffer today but why did this happen why did the immense increase of wealth and prosperity not correspond to an increase of human happiness but instead lead to the emasculation of men the breakdown of the family and the disappearance of religion and morality 
in these series of articles i examine the root causes of this paradox what one can do about it on an individual dietary level and what one can do about it on an individual environmental level i am a strong believer in social change through individual growth and having experienced a dramatic turnaround in the quality of my own personality and success of my outcomes as a result of following these strategies i hope that others can benefit from my knowledge and similarly make themselves into solid men popular mainstream theories for social degeneration 
many authors have postulated economic reasons for this degenerationindustrialization having deprived men of their primary roles as the masters of nature reduced their worth and attractivenessor utilityin the eyes of women relatedly others argue that technological progress which increased independence and ability for all allowed women to go their own way 
another popular argument is that increased prosperity leads to reduced incentive for disciplinerselection versus kselectionand so prosperous disciplined societies create a generation of lazy youngsters fat off the success of their parents who cause so much havoc with their short sighted policies that their civilization collapses leading to a new generation of disciplined youngsters who again create greatness one example of a shortsighted policy would be the feminist political movement which artificially separated woman from man by giving her through affirmative action socially harmful economic independence 
while all these explanations bear some truth none of them delve into the deeply emotional spiritual human and thus fundamentally biological causes of social degeneration why the mainstream theories are flawed 
to begin with a healthy man and a healthy woman even with modern technology at their disposal should not so substantially less love and cherish each other as seems to be the case today the proof of this can be seen by examining what it is women do with that technology a modern loose woman uses technology to go to places where men can ravish her even if it gives woman the ability to go it alone technology does not diminish her emotional and biological need for man 
further the availability of technology does not always translate into its adoptionthe failure of google glass is the emblematic example it does not have to be the case that smartphones are automatically adopted for slut culturethey do not have to automatically lead to female promiscuity anyone familiar with russian or japanese women who have the same technology at hand but a vastly greater sense of restraint and selfworth can attest to this fact therefore the technological argument is not sufficient to explain modern degeneracy although it is certainly a necessary condition credit ninaras credit moguphotos 
to briefly examine the argument that men no longer have nonfinancial utility in the eyes of women a man is not necessarily attractive to a woman if he actually breaks rocks or actually kills other peopleinstead being able to is sufficient 
therefore the emotional and spiritual inseparability of a healthy woman from her evolved master man remains and will remain eternally true the change in technology and the nature of mens work is not the causal factorinstead the change in preferences of both men and women explains modern degeneracy men hardly today want to lead and possess their woman and women do not respond to weakling men 
let us examine the rk selection argument if it were the case that wealth and ease begat indiscipline automatically it would be true that the rich produce weak and undisciplined progeny this may seem like a truism today viewed through the lens of the postindustrial overpopulated paris hilton west but in societies of the past it was certainly not the caserather historically the opposite has been true the weak were poor because they were undisciplined and the strong were rich because they were disciplined the poor raised weak and hence undisciplined children while the rich raised strong and disciplined ones so the cycle continued and over time aristocracies formed 
an extreme version of this disciplinedrich mentality can be seen in modern british farmers many of whom financially wealthy and prosperous drive old beaten suvs reuse clothes and generally minimize expenditures while it cannot be denied that even the modern rich have in general become mostly degenerate this is in my opinion a disproportionately visible symptom of a deeper malaise that affects society across the board 
therefore i do not rely on the technological or economic explanations for societal degenerationi view these theories as descriptive of passing symptoms or trends and not timelessly causal truthsint the population growth nutritional depletion and environmental pollution theory of societal degeneration 
having outlined and accounted for the above theories i argue instead that the degeneration of society is caused mostly by the biological degeneration of the human being that makes up the society this degeneration is caused by factors that affect the human organism on the basest level and the two primary factors are nutritional depletion of food caused by the growth of industrial agriculture which itself is made necessary by unprecedented population growth the pollution of the environment caused by industry and the introduction of unsafe technology 
according to this view it was not the boomers access to ease that made them such degenerate and irresponsible scum but rather the fact that the rapid population increase during their key developmental years meant that the growth of industrial agriculture that somewhat necessarily accompanied itthe green revolutioncreated such nutritionally sparse food that there was insufficient development of boomers brains leading to a generation of overgrown children 
further according to this theory the increased dependence on technology is not viewed as the cause of millennial autism but rather a symptom of millennial autism recent historical examples 
consider the historical path of communism which did not generally spring up in the villages this was not because the landlords were better able to control the peasants but instead because poor city dwellers even if earning a higher income than poor peasants had access to much worse food and lived in a far dirtier environment making them both mentally and physically ill the unfortunate result of insufficient mental development in a crisis situation  our aim should be to save as many leftists as possible and almost all can be 
the poor in the countryside today continue to vote conservative or liberal while the urban poor vote socialist for this same reason the rural poor despite usually being less wealthy than the urban poor are intellectually mature enough to see how harmful a controlling government can be the urban poor mostly achieve the intellectual maturity of children or adolescents and mostly feel rather than think so they support an emotionbased class war or gender war ideology 
this theory explains the early rise of social justice in europe where industrial agriculture was first adopted on a wide scale and also explains why such movements did not organically grow anywhere else until much later owing to the much later adoption of industrial agriculture it should be noted that in the countries where communist revolutions were actually successful they enjoyed no broad support but instead were able to defeat the mostly preindustrial historical governments because of these governments economic weakness and also because of extensive support by globalist or communist interests this was true in russia china and cambodia ancient historical examples 
this theory also explains the path of historical civilizationsromes case is highly instructive at its birth rome was a small collection of largely selfsufficient highly disciplined towns where the diet like in many towns of that era was a mixture of grains vegetables small farmed meats like chickens and hunted meatswhat we would call a balanced diet in this society men were the masters of their households with power of life and death over their family members while facing total responsibility for their family members behaviour only a group of strong capable and selfdisciplined individuals could sustain such a social order population of the city of rome e   million inhabitants  source wwwdavidgalbraithorg 
romes extreme martial and social discipline led to expansion as it expanded and the citys population grew the diet for most people changed over time to mostly grains farmed highly intensively shipped in from all over the empire losing a lot of its nutrition on the way simultaneously and partly as a result of rising grain production meat consumption fell reducing the populations testosterone levels leading to falling strength and willingness or ability to compete as well as rising mental illness because of copper overload 
the weakened populations increasing demands for emotion based socialism led to the growth of a massive welfare state and eventual bankruptcy hyperinflation and collapse of the central government 
india is another equally tragic example the population growth that resulted from highly prosperous nanda rule led to the growth of buddhism and the adoption of degenerate attitudes moral collapse and eventually weakness to invasion after the institutionalization of buddhism by powerhungry and utterly machiavellian psychopath ashokawho looked to weaken the brahmins hinduisms traditional moral guidesbuddhisms degenerate vegetarian curse spread like a virus and created over several generations a population of weaklings who werent again able to assert their independence for over a thousand years the song dynasty followed a similar path as these two empires being eventually overrun by the mongols the yuan dynasty population of china  source vaclab smil chinas environmental crisis  
this degradation of the diet caused by population growth has been at least a significant causal element behind the degeneracy and collapse of most prosperous sedentary civilizations the modern context 
the dramatic increase of the population since ancient times should help you understand why humans today are such fools and weaklings compared to our ancestors there is only so much nutrition in the worlds topsoil to go around and a population seven times greater than  years ago eating a diet uncorrected through nutritional supplementation for dietary sparsity will be living individually in effect  th the life that its ancestor population did is it any wonder that people today feel so weak and helpless that they want mommy government and daddy police state to give them the illusion of comfort and security 
this theory is also borne out in the data in general food today contains ½ to  th the nutrients it did in the s which was already about  years after the adoption of modern style industrial agriculture in the west this dramatic fall in nutrition has accompanied the tripling of the global population and closeto doubling of the european population since that time while some population control seems necessary i believe that sustainable organic agriculture combined with nutritional supplementation should obviate a large amount of needed population reduction 
i hope that the reader is after consideration of these facts sufficiently convinced of the true causes behind the modern worlds degeneracy people have fairly universally across the political spectrum become weak and insane from malnutrition artificial protein may have allowed some men to grow muscles and calcium from an overreliance on milk may have allowed them to grow tall but perhaps the lack of most necessary nutrients has meant that they are generally still retarded emotionally spiritually and intellectually the effects on modern society 
this weakness amongst menand dietary sparsity has disproportionately affected men due to our much greater nutritional requirementshas not just resulted in an inability to control the destructive forces that lie latent in every society worse the fundamental outlook of men who viewed themselves as the creators of civilization the slayers of enemies and the protectors of women all under god has changed the modern millennial man is a childlike hedonist who cares little for his civilization culture or people an aspiring patriarch an example of testicular failure image credit giorgiomtbshutterstock environmental toxins 
environmental toxins are also a problem electrical oestrogen and toxic metal pollution are underresearched but may have devastating effects on human health radio waves plastics unfiltered medication and purposely added toxins in the water supply like fluoride and chlorine have deleterious effects too what can we do 
considering these realities it serves little purpose to blame women for their selfdestructive behavior while in the past like men women used to have enough emotional maturity to try to live a life of selfrespect for example by remaining virgins and not drinking alcohol they have never had much agency charisma or true self will even before the diet was empty and before they were being stuffed full of drugs and chemicals by the unscrupulous pharmaceutical industry and its proxies 
these poisons may cause serious and dangerous although slowly fixable hormonal and behavioral changes but the real effects are felt by their offspring unfortunately once a woman is hooked on these drugs for example the birth control pill or antidepressants she is unlikely to come off them and if she does she is unlikely to do anything to fix the damage to herself or her future children this is especially the case as the medical industry which has brainwashed her to see doctors and the state as her loving protectors is unlikely to recommend it 
even so these drugs dont permanently alter the fact that women as mostly emotion driven actors are biologically and intrinsically people pleasers and respond automatically to the most powerful person or group of people that can give them a raison dêtre even if we cant ensure that women in general improve their diet and avoid pollutants we can certainly make changes on an individual level convincing or browbeating our girlfriends sisters and mothers 
the healthier a woman gets the greater her affinity with nature becomes and the more maternal she feels so you can be fairly certain that shell try and pass on the knowledge to her children and friends like our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers did furthermore there are a large minority of health conscious women who it should be our duty to marry and impregnate as many times as possible considering the rapid population declines that will occur in the atheist and leftist segments of our countries native populations these women are our best hope for creating a viable future you will have to teach her a few things credit csp_subbotina the situation is not hopelessbut we have a fight on our hands 
in the past wellinformed people couldnt expect due to the limited and elitecontrolled nature of communication technology and the educational system to make any impact on the vast majority of the population the political fight against big agra and big pharma seemed hopeless today is different the growth of the internet and the increasing spread of awareness has meant that more people are aware about the importance of eating well avoiding environmental dangers and supplementing wisely 
this is partly evidenced by the steadily rising percentage of people who eat organic diets and the booming supplement industry i hope that in the future at least a significant portion of us can survive in a sane enough state to politically fight back against moves by globalists islamists communists and ruthless financiers who are circling like vultures over our degenerating civilizations 
on the other side of this political battle the globalist controlled medical industry has been the biggest proponent of unhealthy diets and dangerous and addictive drugs special interests have also been the biggest corrupters of regulators and the institutions created to defend the population against industrial and chemical pollution 
a system of global monopoly wealth extraction is not possible with active capable and selfconfident masculinities from proud nationstates to resist it those who seek to benefit from such a monopoly system have tried their absolute hardest to suppress natural health information but so far they have failed and the situation is only improving so there is considerable reason for hope conclusion 
our forefathers demanded to fulfill their destiny ordained by the gods to defend our civilizations against the forces of rapacious greed and murderous atheistic villainyto be the protectors and kings of our people today most men are mentally ill and have become childish hedonistic narcissists as expected the ruthless and soulless have exploited this weakness for their own benefit now that you have i hope understood the principles behind why most of us have lost the urge to fight to protect our cultures the cause and fix to the industrial malaise should no longer seem out of reach or impossible to grasp 
this area of the human condition is just one another where we stand at the crossroads of history but in my opinion it is the most important if the dietary trend of the last two centuries is not reversed and the nutritional quality of at least a significant minority of men is not substantially improved then each generation of people will become more communist more feminist and more weak than the last and the globalist special interests that seek to create a totalitarian worldmonopoly police state will win regardless of temporary political victories 
each of us has chosen a path to follow in our quest for spiritual intellectual and national salvation this is mine in my future articles i will detail the best dietary approach for strong men and beautiful women to follow and overview the most important environmental precautions we must take in our quest to fix the root causes of modern degeneracy 
i hope that ultimately you are convinced to help me and others like me prevent our world from collapsing entirely into a miserable cyberpunk dystopia oct   kshatriya indransha",2016-10-27

 airbnbs new sjw diktat 
shortterm residential accommodation network airbnb is forcing its providers to adhere to a new nondiscrimination policy  including a requirement to accept transgender people the policy takes effect on november  and is accompanied by a slew of other recent or impending changes which airbnb says are designed to make its community more inclusive those who refuse to accept the main nondiscrimination policy will barred from listing their properties with airbnb 
the major problem with airbnbs new nondiscrimination provisions is that they really just represent an euphemismbowing to a customers feelings rather than proven discrimination the overall framework of the companys policy alterations assumes that those accommodation providers accused of discrimination are actually guilty of it this rush to judgment gives little or no recourse to those who depend on airbnb to generate an income it also makes it very easy for certain protected groups most notably transgender people to falsely or very loosely claim discrimination when in fact the issue is likely to be the prospective guests temperament or perceived reliability in respecting the property 
secondly the policy changes ignore the unique nature of sharing economy sites like airbnb accommodation providers are often accepting guests into their literal homes or their sole investment property whereas hotels have roundtheclock staff including security airbnb properties are much more informal and unsupervised providers therefore have good reasons to be very judicious about who exactly they let into their residences airbnbs open doors policy treats any discrimination complaint as gospel truth brian chesky mustve drank the same poisoned water as fellow tech sjw jack dorsey of twitter 
well be implementing a new policy called open doors starting october st if a guest anywhere in the world feels like they have been discriminated against in violation of our policy  in trying to book a listing having a booking canceled or in any other interaction with a host  we will find that guest a similar place to stay if one is available on airbnb or if not we will find them an alternative accommodation elsewhere 
 brian chesky airbnb ceo and cofounder 
in addition to dictating what kinds of guests can enter their providers properties another one of airbnbs new policies which is already in force treats those accused of discrimination as immediately guilty rather than determining whether discrimination has occurred airbnb has made it clear that it will bend over backwards to find those claiming discrimination other accommodation within its network or more strangely still alternative accommodation outside its network the second arm of this discrimination response will become very interesting indeed should privatelyowned airbnb decide to go public it is hard to see how shareholders would acquiesce to a company offering customers thirdparty accommodation options that effectively deprive it of money 
airbnb is simply trying to have its cake and eat it too on the one hand it wants to create as wide a market for itself as possible now having providers offering  listings in  cities around the world on the other hand however it wants to assume total control for determining what is and what is not discrimination despite having no ability to verify pretty much any of the accusations airbnb are mere gatekeepers providing a rudimentary service that makes its bucks by the sheer volume of providers these same providers should not suffer because of the companys thinlyspread business model allegations of discrimination have been scant at best we dont question the right of people to be selective about new housemates so why not airbnb providers and their guests 
various news articles reporting on the shift in airbnb policies have only been able to point to isolated instances of even alleged  let alone proven discrimination the best that sjw enablers can offer is a deeply flawed harvard study which claimed that prospective guests with stereotypical africanamerican names like latoya and darnell were  percent less likely to be approved by the companys accommodation providers considering that a guests profile provides a lot more information than just their name the harvard research leaves a lot to be desired 
moreover names like cletus and marysue would arguably garner even less approvals both these white names and the aforementioned africanamerican names usually dovetail with some of americas least sophisticated and worldly types the exact kinds of people least likely to be allowed into someones home it has precious little to do with race and almost everything to do with runofthemill decisions about how to safeguard ones own property by entrusting it to the right people such decisions are routinely accepted when new housemates are sought so why not with airbnb has airbnb signed its own execution order  bookingcom is better than airbnb  cheaper prices always instant booking tons of apartment listings better interface and no sjw crap 
 roosh rooshv october   
just as roosh swears by bookingcom there are plenty of other options you can take in avoiding airbnb from now on like twitter the company is quickly falling under the spell of the sjw crowd it seems certain that minus a backtrack airbnb and its reputation will follow jack dorseys company into the abyss unlike twitter though airbnb may never make the jump to publiclylisted company

1187,liberal cnn commentator blames republicans for obamacares rising premiums,"it wasnt long ago that the left represented the antiestablishment wing in politics they used to fight against globalism remember the antiglobalization movement even if their motives were different from those of todays antiglobalists as well as being against censorship imperialist wars and the expanding powers of governments and corporations but today you see leftists protesting against brexit attacking and censoring anyone who disagrees with the establishment using twitter on their apple products while sipping on their starbucks coffee and are calling for war in syria to challenge the russians so just how the hell did did they end up becoming the patsies for the elites

to understand we must go back to  when the occupy movement was ongoing the occupy protests which now seem like ages ago came about as a response to the economic downturn with the people realizing that they were being screwed by the system we can debate endlessly about exactly who these people were and the motives behind them but the important fact is that to the elites it was a sign that the people were waking up and challenging their power
the elites were in a panic as this was the first time in postwar history that the people of west mobilized in mass to threaten their rule so the cabals decided that they needed to act fast before the whole movement evolved to a fullblown revolution and they already had a plan in mind the never antiquated strategy of divide and rule
the diversion 
when the people are discontent and angry from being powerless and dispossessed the pressure will mount and it wont go anywhere the people want to vent out their frustrations the elites know that responding directly with repression only inspires greater desire to rise up so instead of fighting it they prefer to rechannel that pent up energy elsewhere
on february  with the occupy movement still raging the elites were given that golden opportunityor rather they created onewhen a black teenager was shot dead in florida the none other than the infamous trayvon martin case the shooter wasnt even a full white but the elites jumped at the chance and used their control of the media to throw everything they had on it anything to divert the public attention away from them with their efforts it quickly became the biggest story of america
but they didnt stop there police shootings which have always been happening and to all races were also highly publicized by the mainstream media to stoke liberal outrage and racial tensions that led to the creation of black lives matter movementa movement that is financed by george soros and others to stir up unrests across america
did the elites convert occupy protesters into sjw patsies
the diversion was complete as the people were now more interested in racial issues than the  who were dictating their lives the occupy movement faded away and the people were now venting out their anger elsewhere although i dont have as much proof as with the rise of blm movement i strongly suspect that the resurgence of social justice warriors around the same time is also the work of the elites who want the leftists to target fellow citizens over asinine cultural issues rather than the established order
the strategy 
back in th century karl marx claimed that religion and nationalism was being used to distract the masses from the fact that they were being oppressed under capitalism if we were to apply this concept to the world today the culture wars going on now are distractions to keep the masses from undermining the power of the elites
the goal the elites is simple divide the masses and let them fight each other so that they will never come together to topple those in power meanwhile they themselves focus on expanding their own wealth and continue to implement institutional control to further their globalist plans the worst case scenario the elites want to avoid is to have the common people unite as one so they must do everything they can to fragment them by creating as many divisions as possible
my understanding of their modus operandi is this  use hotbutton issues to stir up controversy something that doesnt affect them like gay marriage race issues and all other politically correct nonsense  have the leftists either get outraged or do something that will provoke a reaction from the right  let the people vent out their anger onto each other and get at each others throats  when the issue fades away foment a new controversy to repeat the whole process by cycling through them over and over again the elites are able to maintain the status quo and keep the people from uniting against them
thus we have our current situation where the masses are divided with blacks against whites women against men islam and atheism against christianity left against right and so on but no more antiglobalization tea party movement or occupy wall street
as long as those on the left continue berating the right as racists sexists and bigots who are controlled by corporations and the right in turn accuse the left of being degenerate socialist slackers who just want freebies from a nanny government nothing will change as long as the two sides see each others as enemies who are stupid and ignorant and getting in the way of creating a decent society the people will remain divided as long as the rest of the population go berserk over wedding cakes for homosexuals the latest misogynist outrage or how a lion named cecil got shot the elites will continue to win
a couple more points to consider i know they look like an occupying army but theres nothing to be alarmed about theyre just your friendly neighborhood police doing their jobs to protect you from the terrorists
first while this article has been focused on how the left has been toyed by the globalist elites lets not forget that the right are not totally immune to their influence either remember how neocons  globalists puppets disguised as conservatives  effectively lured the conservatives in america through faith and patriotism the support they got from that base was the impetus to launch their war against iraq based on bullshit evidences of wmds and saddamalqueda link while the right has changed a lot since then there are still conservatives today who are itching for a war with russia because usa usa usa 
second it is crucial to remember that although the main goal is to maintain divide and rule it is not the end of it the elites have far more sinister aims by raising hell in societies through demographic conflicts and terrorism the elites are preparing for a total social control i get the feeling that the elites are letting the chaos and violence run its course so that the people from the two opposing camps will join together in their approval of new government measures for social control
no matter their differences when the people get terrified of savagery and disorder theyll welcome the state to intervene in the name of security europe is already getting used to large military presence on their streets while the us government is seemingly preparing for a war against their own citizens  a leaked soros memo also reveals that the blm movement is potentially being used to federalize the us police  while many people seem to be concerned about violence and terrorism it seems those are just tools used by the elites to justify a totalitarian state in the near future
the culture wars necessary fight or engineered distraction 
the issue of culture wars is not an easy one as they are important in many ways but are still forms of distraction implemented by the elites
on one hand we are playing into the hands of elites by raging against social justice and feminist pigshits instead of trying to stop the globalists zionists  bankers megacorporations  and the governments from undermining our existence really do the issues of politicallyincorrect halloween costumes and whatever bathroom trannies use matter more than the fact that the middleclass is being destroyed revelations of massive corruption in the dnc the coming policestate and the globalist wars that are causing death and destruction around the world all the drama of outrage and counteroutrage is silly when the elites are snickering as their new world order is taking shape
on the other hand culture does matter in many ways uncontrolled immigration antimale laws and censorship are all very relevant issues and as much of the leftists are now serving as pawns of the establishment the situation isnt exactly the divide and rule model i described above in a way we are now forced to fight the left and everyone else who are getting in the way of fighting the globalist elites
so does this mean we should ally with those who scorn us or should we continue playing the elites games and bicker with their sjw drones i dont have a good answer but whatever we choose to do i believe it is crucial for us to focus our battles and not get trolled into petty issues that the mainstream media wants us to focus on we should always keep in mind that it is always those at the top who are the true enemies of mankind
conclusion is there still hope 
although we no longer see grassroots movements and popular mobilization the current us election has shown that the people are still awake and sick of the establishment to me that alone is a hopeful sign that people are still willing to challenge the ruling class
with bernie sanders brought down by the establishment and his supporters scattered into different camps the only antiestablishment movement now is the presidential campaign led by donald trump this is why we are seeing unprecedented efforts by the elites to bring down trump and use disgruntled leftists against his supporters
i have my doubts about trump  but he is thousand times preferable to the certain nightmare that hillary clinton will bring to america and the world if she gets elected but besides voting i believe that it is more important for the people themselves to wake up and be aware of the methods of control that are being implemented upon us we cant constantly expect some knight in shinning armor to come rally us we must take the initiative ourselves and be willing to fight for our own destiny

1188,mission accomplished rt crew finds refugees still at jungle camp despite successful eviction,"when people ask me about my current position fighting in the culture war years after starting my writing career with bang books i simply say i just wanted to get laid from these hedonistic beginnings opened a path that i find myself in today a reviewer of my new book free speech isnt free also noticed this transformation
ive been following the red pill community for a a few years now the members therein have been engaging in some of the most relevant conversations anywhere on the net roosh is one ive only recently become familiar with as i tend to appreciate and relate more to the more traditionalist members like vox day dalrock and roissy
what is so fascinating about guys like roosh is how their journey to acquire more sex and attention from highly attractive women has led them stumbling across uncomfortable truths about the world that we men of the west find ourselves living in
this book is a very straightforward account of an encounter that an iconic red pill pillar had with the traditional media community that exposes a truly shocking level of laziness and corruption on the part of an institution that we are supposed to respect for some reason i remember watching from a social media distance as these events went down and i had no idea just how bad it was
i really admire the stones on this kid and i hope he stays motivated and encourages more people to be bold with the truth which is always unpc im not a fan of lotharios but i appreciate intellectual honesty and bravery i hope rooshs neomasculinity gets legs i really do
how did game serve as the gateway drug simple i kept asking why as if i was an annoying yearold child
why are woman attracted to me when i dance and act like an entertaining clown  why did my father not have to act like a clown to attract my mom why has society changed to encourage women to pursue exciting bad boys and clowns over good men why are institutions like the media and universities pushing women into behaviors which harm them and the family unit why is there a concealed group of elites who seem to control politicians and the most important institutions why are those institutions attacking me for speaking the truth there wasnt only one step from having fun into the nightclub to fighting back against social justice warriors and the media but several steps that had to take place over the past  years my path weaved through sex and gender relations but there are other paths as well which i describe in the  paths to realizing truth  for example minimalism is another point of entry
when you live below your means you begin to see that most people are unnecessarily living above theirs that leads to the conclusion that they were trained to live a life of excess by corporations with the complicit help of a government that wants to keep society in a neverending state of indebtedness and distraction so they ignore everyday injustices while losing any will or desire to fight the establishment the easiest stepping stone out of the truman show is to realize that consumer lifestyles are not the path to happiness and those those who chase material possessions are misguided
many other men have also had a similar path as myself whereby promiscuous sex was a device for understanding the world and deciding on behaviors that are more sustainable to the male soul while not every man gains wisdom during the stage of his life where he wants to sow his royal oats many do and they use that wisdom to devise solutions that can solve our modern problems i do not at all regret engaging in shallow sex with many dozens of women throughout the world because it has developed my thinking into what you read now even though the sex itself wasnt especially memorable and didnt give me much except momentary pleasure
from my current vantage point it really does feel like it was all predetermined as if i was supposed to participate in shallow intimacy in order to arrive at true understanding but that would imply some sort of divine providence whatever the mechanism its clear to me that many of the behaviors and ideas we hold now could be mere waystations for a grander more universal truth whatever individual journey youre a part of i hope well find out soon enough

1189,dying out wild animal numbers could fall by  from  study says,"a subject not often discussed is the topic of how to repair strained or broken relationships it is one that comes up in everyones life so it will be useful to make a few suggestions about it here we will talk about relationships from friends family and lovers
relationships among friends we will treat first the first step in this process is to make an evaluation to determine whether the relationship is worth saving or rehabilitating it is a simple fact of life that some relationships have an expiration date when two people no longer have anything in common or their paths take them in divergent directions it may be difficult to find common ground in this situation it is always better to let the relationship die a natural death slowly rather than rapidly abrupt terminations may leave the other party with negative feelings and this should be avoided if at all possible
there are some instances where repair is not possible when someone has committed a fundamental violation of trust or respect this is a warning sign that the person was never a friend in the first place another point to keep in mind is that repair of a broken relationship requiresno demandsthe participation of both parties if the other person is unwilling to participate in the process then your efforts will be futile and will come to nothing

once we have determined that the friendship is worth repairing or sustaining the next step is to decide how to make the first approach to the other party in this we must try to evaluate the reasons for the problems in the first place we should make an honest assessment about how things got to where they are did someone say or do something that caused hard feelings on the other side was there some intervening cause that made the two parties diverge in plans and activities these types of questions must be honestly and repeatedly asked we have a tendency to minimize our own hurtful actions and exaggerate those of others and this must be kept in mind
the key rule at this point is to try to put ourselves in the shoes of the other party we must try to see things from our friends perspective for many people this can be difficult as it involves getting past our own feelings of hurt or rejection and into the shoes of the other person and yet it is essential very frequently the reasons for strained or broken friendships lies in the fact that there is some problem going on in the other persons life only by being a perceptive student of human nature can we divine the cause sometimes the only thing that caused the strained relationship was some misunderstanding that was easily curable
keep in mind that we must tryat least in our own mindsto discover the source of the other persons problem this is not always possible as human beings are not always rational but we can at least make the effort i remember in the film hoffa that there was a great line from jack nicholson he told one of his men real problems real grievances can be resolved they can be negotiated but imaginary grievances that man is going to hate you for life i have no idea if jimmy hoffa every actually said this but it sounds like something he would have said he meant that we should avoid hurting the pride of our friends we should be acutely aware how it is sometimes the intangible slights that can most rankle with a man
when you have decided to make the first step it is always better to initiate contact directly do not wait for the other person to do it depending on the circumstances this should be done discreetly and without too much in the way of overpowering insistence there is a certain type of finesse that a man should have at critical times and this is one of them the approach should be direct but neither insistent nor demanding a fish is best hooked with a lure gently laid
of vital importance here is that the approach be sincere one should genuinely want to contact the other party sincerity is the glue that binds friendships together and permits their longevity there should be no hypocrisy or falsity in any of our dealings with friends this kind of thing is immediately apparent and once detected its whiff surrounds the offending party like a permanent cloud if the other party is receptive to the approach we can then gradually feel our way forward taking care to avoid the reasons why the friendship became strained in the first place things may never quite go back to what they were but at least we can find solid ground for a new frame of reference
two examples will suffice here the historian william shirer worked closely with famed correspondent edward r murrow when the two were in germany in the s yet after the war was over the two grew apart shirers account of the estrangement suggests that he was repelled by murrows enthusiastic adoption of the anticommunist hysteria of the time shirer found himself gradually blackballed from most major news networks before being forced out completely he broke with murrow over these events many decades later he approached murrow all venom spent the two were able to find common ground again

another example makes the same point theodore roosevelt was a strongwilled insistent man to say the least he was in a position to choose his successor as president and to this end he selected a man very different from him the affable and rotund william howard taft taft eventually began to find roosevelt an overbearing and unwelcome presence in his life the two men eventually broke completely a result of their personality differences and different conceptions of leadership to his credit roosevelt eventually approached his old friend privately to patch things up they were never the same of course but at least some cordiality was restored
relationships with family are of a fundamentally different sort because we are linked by bonds of blood or perhaps marriage it will be more difficult to disentangle ourselves from those with whom we have become estranged on the other hand it may be easier to repair such grievances or at least find common ground since there may be more shared experiences with the other party that act in our favor the key here is not to expect too much although shared history and common blood may work in our favor they can be counterbalanced to some extent by the fact that irrational family antagonisms can run deeper than those from strained friendships patience and persistence are most important here perhaps more so than friendships with those unrelated to us

repairing strained relationships with lovers is perhaps the most difficult when a man and woman have been united in the past through the coital act an entirely different set of emotions and motivations come into play relationships between lovers can fail or become strained for an infinite number of reasons and it would be impossible to discuss all of them here it is enough for me to state my opinion that it is nearly impossible to bring an intimate sexual relationship back to what it was after it has been broken
strained is one thing broken is quite another my own experience leads me to believe that once a sexual relationship is done it is done one cannot really go back to what it was before amicable dealings are certainly possible and happen all the time but i would not call this friendship i would call it an uneasy equilibrium loves inflammatory presence scorches all it leaves in its wake

1191,no title,"october has been a portentous month for the presidential campaign in the beginning of the month women came forward accusing trump of unwelcome advances later fbi director james comey reopened the criminal investigation of hillary clinton after finding more government emails on pervert anthony weiners computer but the most important event may be a meme campaign that highlights hillarys support forcing women to register for the selective service
the meme campaign consisted of dozens of fake ads posted under the draftourdaughters hashtag that highlight two very important policy points of the hillary campaign first hillary is a radical feminist thus she favors equality in all thingsthat includes equality in combat as a step in that direction hillary told the huffington post that she will support legislation to register for the draft
young women may think registering for the draft is not a big deal they should reconsider because of the second policy of the clinton campaign she will almost certainly start a war against russiaa war that will see those young women drafted into combat on the front lines
hillary has repeatedly blamed russia for wikileaks and she stated that she would get revenge through military action
as president i will make it clear that the united states will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack we will be ready with serious political economic and military responses 
the draftourdaughters campaign could be the thing that brings down the hillary campaign to get elected hillary relies on two demographics people of color and liberal white women up until now women have been able to support leftist social policy because it did not impact them negatively if they become aware that hillary intends to draft them into combat to fight a war with russia they may rethink the wisdom of their equalist position
here are some of the best examples of the draftourdaughters campaign

i feel this one is the most powerful it clearly states hillarys intention to put women into combat and start a war with russia unlike the arab nations that the us has been toppling for the neocons russia has a formidable military and nuclear weapons any military conflict will not be short and easy that means it will highly likely that young women will soon find themselves getting blown to smithereens if they elect hillary



the above three ads all target the weak cowardly men who either support hillary or the never trump cuckservatives in the alt right these men are frequently portrayed as being cuckolded by wives hence they are often mocked for their wives having children who are not their own my wifes son or my wifes daughter
the ad below drives this point home even more forcefully while women might encourage their men to vote hillary or oppose trump for being too alpha they secretly despise the weakness of these men

the following ads are directed to convincing women of the ramifications of their decision to vote feminist feminism taken to its logical conclusion means you are going to have to trade your louboutins for combat boots


 


lots of the ads emphasize hillarys extremely aggressive stance toward putin and russia she has blamed wikileaks on russian hacking even though there is no proof that the russians were to blame and she and the obama administration have been saber rattling against russia in syria
the really frightening thing is that mainstream pundits are now starting to parrot the idea that the us must go to war with russia all the more reason to elect someone who is not controlled by wealthy donors like hillary


the ad below indicates that our enemy putin has a saner view on women in combat than the democrats do

while the campaign is mostly geared to point out hillarys intention to draft women it also reminds men that their lives will not be spared in the conflagration that hillary will start

the media often portrays war as a sanitized affair a soldier safely positioned in a uslocated command center controls a drone that takes out the bad guys the reality of war is that people from both warring factions die and are maimed once hillary gets in it wont be just men dying in large numbers women will experience equality in having their lives snuffed out


a final ad drives home the point that the future war with russia and iran and syria will not be any sort of conflict against barbarism or evil it will be for hillarys power trip 
conclusion elections matter for decades women have voted for leftist policies that have put the burden on other people if they are successful in electing hillary they will face the bitter consequences of their decisions but unfortunately they will not be the only people impacted thousands of innocent americans russians syrians and iranians will also have to pay the price of their virtue signaling
the draftourdaughters campaign may be enough to wake some of them up from their folly

1192,no title,"the greatest trick that feminism has pulled is to convince the masses that women are presently disadvantaged relative to men
it is true that at first glance men dominate every field from business to pokémon go achievements  which can lead some to think that there is a conspiracy against women but the male superiority in many fields is exactly what allows society to prosper years after the humiliating debunking of the wage gap its time to address the real elephant in the room the fact that women dont pay taxes
a research report on the fiscal contribution of men and women across age groups was published by the victoria university of wellington  lets explore the key findings

this is the wellknown earnings gap incorrectly referred to as the wage gap womens preference for low paying jobs among others is a factor at play here another factor is the amount of women working part time the average week for women in this research was  hours and  for men the workforce participation rate did not differ between men and women in significant ways

this is the disposable income this is the income remaining after deduction of taxes and other mandatory charges available to be spent or saved as one wishes you can see that progressive taxes unfairly impact males  and reduces males disposable income near womens although the market income was almost double that of womens if it disproportionately affects men  you can be assured that no one will complain

those are the raw taxes paid by men and women the tax gap has oddly never been an gender issue until now

when the tax money received by men and women is included in the equation you can see that for most of womens lives except between  to  they receive more tax money than they supply the state with men on the other hand give the state more tax money than they receive from  to  years

this is where it gets upsetting as you can see womens short period of positive fiscal impact doesnt come close to counterbalance an already massive overall negative impact the net fiscal incidence on men is approximately zero when accumulated over all ages as such society invests in young males and they subsequently pay back societys investment women bear massive costs to society while we were taught to see them as underprivileged
by the end of her life the average woman will cost about  to the average taxpayer this means that an average man is extorted  in his lifetime that will be directly transferred to women if men could use that money to their will women would chase men as much as men chase women nowadays
there are a few confounds that need to be ruled out the authors mention specifically that health and education costs are almost equal for men and women also the workforce percentage doesnt exceed  difference between men and women women dont spend more for children either according to the report even if there were confounds that needed to be accounted for this is not something feminists have done for the cent wage gap they have compared raw percentages without accounting for any confounding factors
also these numbers do not include massive costs for the governmental budget for womens issues that is a massive burden for the state for instance my local government from a canadian province of  million people just announced a  plan to fight sexual violence against women  after two immigrants dingdongditched women in a student house 
add to that millions invested in sexed programs in which a feminist teaches boys that porn movies tailored for them shouldnt be imitated and that instead that they should have their partners pleasure in mind while teaching the exact opposite to girls the government takes money from males to empower women into hating men and their contribution to society
httpstcornbrpfws québec canada announces  million plan against sexual violence after two foreigners touched female students
 nicolas kilsdonk nkgervais october   

the data also doesnt include all the money directly and personally transferred from a man to a woman for instance while women make so little they still account for  of all consumer purchases  and you were wondering why marketers so desperately try to appeal to women in advertisements
a metaphor for male taxpayers and women this is a real danone ad watch it here or see my comment here 
the only defense that feminists can use when confronted with these facts is that women invest so much time in children however feminists made it very clear in the past decades that a womans contribution to society shouldnt be based on her involvement with children moreover at birth rates of half the necessary  birthrate for population stability theyre also doing the children thing pretty badly
these findings raise a serious question would feminism survive a libertarian regime that doesnt involve male tax money after all it is not a coincidence that women consistently vote for a welfare state within  years of womens suffrage in the usa the government doubled their tax expenditure and revenue  womens voting patterns have made the government become the new providing husband but this time the providing husband doesnt get a woman or children in return remove taxes and no woman will ever claim to be a strong independent woman the state is cucking you a little like if prostitution was not only legal but free  most guys would probably be strong independent single males
pretty ironic that the institution that gives money to women for being pregnant prevents them from being paid less makes abortions affordable is entirely supported by men feminists are not seriously against living in a society entirely supported by men they are just against men having the autonomy over the wealth they create male wealth is a public good and female wealth is her body her choice

if hillary wins theres the real possibility of protests the day after the election and the social conditioning of whites to be polite and docile even as theyre railroaded in what was formerly their nation may not hold this time around a hillary win means the chaos and possibly violence could wait until she starts stripping constitutional rights away then we are likely to see conservatives finally come out and start raising some righteous hell there could be racially motivated clashes on the horizon as white people standing up for themselves goes against a longestablished narrative that theyre all evil racists
few people think of the effects civil unrest could have on their livelihood and wellbeing its time for a little education on just how thinly stretched the american supply chain is and what could happen with only a shortterm disruption in it
heres a scenario  just one of many possible scenarios video of rioters stopping and then looting a semi tractortrailer in charlotte is worrying because if trucks stop america stops if attacks on truckers happen often enough truckers may decide its not worth the risk to their lives to continue moving freight around and stop driving within a day bedlam could ensue as the supply chain runs on a razors edge in modern america and everything from food to medication to gasoline starts running out
supply chain rioters broke into trucks on i and burned cargo in charlotte
according to the american trucking association ata a disruption of  to  hours means hospitals and nursing homes would run out of food fuel supplies at gas stations would also run out in that time frame garbage would start to pile up most grocery and retail stores would start to run out of food and merchandise atm and bank cash supplies would also run out
the tight rope the corporate system walks quickly breaks when merchandise stops moving
as an example the ata tells us this is what happens during a hurricane imagine what would happen with days or weeks of rioting in major cities
in a hurricane situation supplies that would normally last a few days such as water powdered milk and canned meat typically disappear within one day given these inventory rates this means that perishable goods could be depleted in a matter of days and nonperishables in just a few days runs on food and nonfood staples during hurricanes and even before big winter storms provide a good example of how fast some retail inventories can be depleted during panic buying the same quick depletion of inventories could occur if trucks stopped making deliveries for any reason
panic buying means no food on the shelves when people dont have food at home and then the grocery store doesnt have food rioting will intensify things could get ugly in a hurry as one small disruption leads to a domino effect after which bedlam ensues
so it is best to be prepared with nonperishable items just in case things get out of hand have at least several weeks food supply on hand but how do you stop people from coming and taking your stash
be armed the police wont be around to protect you if bedlam ensues
contrary to gun propaganda from the media  you absolutely want to be armed in the event the election and its aftermath dont pass peacefully what happens when stores no longer have food and gas stations no longer have gas gangs form looking for homes that do have those items
theyre going to pick out the weakest home in the neighborhood and pounce
a home with guns is a safe home just as this youtube video shows  armed thugs may bust into a house looking for money or food but they started jumping through plate glass windows and scrambling like cockroaches once the homeowner came out with guns blazing
several handguns with extra ammunition are advised know how to use them be steady with the trigger and dont be afraid to use them if looters come to your house
the police will not be there to protect you as theyll have their hands full with the chaos
better to be safe than sorry the idea of an intact nuclear family may be a trite memory but protecting your loved ones is still key
with the meltdown of america happening right before our very eyes we are entering an unstable period in the nations history to say the least no matter who wins the election the nation we once knew and loved is passing away trump may be able to turn things around temporarily but even if he does the country now has so many immigrants it will be impossible to assimilate them all
we are entering a period in which america will resemble a third world country more and more the demographics of the nation are being changed on purpose so white people are diminished at the ballot box and democrats will gain a lock grip on the levers of power in the nation in the coming years  divisions between rich and poor will grow and the evil media will be there stirring the pot with racial class and gender division every step of the way  peace will become a thing of the past as squabbling factions compete with each other for dominance
in this transition from prosperity to despotism it is best to be safe than sorry the day after election day will be telling in that it will set the tone for the next four years it may be a somewhat peaceful turn towards communism if the bitch wins or it may not be
but my money is on a steady degradation of civil society in the coming years tend your own garden as i know i will be tending my own my military friends are already discussing what will happen in shtf scenario you should be thinking about it too

1194,no title,"return of kings has a great variety of information about many subjects improving your social life  health and fitness  tourism  among several others still our political perspectives might be offputting to some readers on the left although you could tune out whatever you dont agree with you might do well to take a closer look not all of us agree on everything but we do have a rough consensus on some items
our views on the political establishment the left blames corporations while the right blames the government when in reality the two interests work together to subvert the will of the people
its pretty easy to see that this site has a mainly conservative perspective especially on social matters not all of us started out that way many of us began our journey away from the political orthodoxy after realizing what a mess feminism has made of society others have been turned off by political correctness once upon a time i used to be liberal and i know im not the only one be that as it may some of us are actually friendly to liberalism 
by the way we dont give a free pass to the mainstream conservative establishment either unfortunately the government in countless ways seeks to amass power for itself while producing fear and dependency in the populace really its not a democrat problem or republican problem theyre basically two sides of the same coin heads they win tails you lose
surely youre in favor of progress one good question though is what exactly this constitutes  also who gets to define what is progress all that might seem rhetorical but these are important matters likely you see change as a good thing but whos setting the agenda deciding which direction that change goes actually we have answers for all that
in fact we might have some more in common with you than you expect dont care for agribusiness neither do we  are you troubled by the influence of the ultrawealthy in the political process we are too  do you suspect that the powerful have set up a system of managed democracy where theyre pulling the purse strings of both the republicans and the democrats if you supported bernie sanders youve probably figured that one out already we understand you
todays political and social scene 
you might be disenchanted by some of the things going on with the democratic party today perhaps youve heard of their hypocrisy and contempt for the public  are you troubled by some of the clinton scandals maybe even wondered if there was more to it than you expected 
perhaps your questioning goes deeper you might wonder who hijacked liberalism  it once stood for helping the working man but some time in the s it turned into so much squabbling divisiveness actually theres a reason for that  the culture war began long before the s that wasnt about liberation but rather a deliberate attempt to spread divisiveness and weaken the fabric of society
also taxpayers have spent untold money on social programs but why dont they solve problems instead they create intergenerational poverty you might be shocked to learn that encouraging dependency along with taxing and spending to oblivion was actually a stratagem meant to crash the system  thats not about helping the disadvantaged its about using them schemes like thesecausing societal upheaval so a socialist paradise will magically fall into placeare pretty reckless
you might shake your head in bewilderment at online mobs of misguided youths spewing bile about things that dont really matter sure youre against police brutality as am i but deep down you also fear what will come of all this open contempt for the law and violence against police  the authorities take a pretty dim view of cop killers kind of sounds like someone behind the scenes wants to start a lot of trouble doesnt it
finally you might wonder if the people on top of the liberal establishment really give a damn about the common people we think its rotten that theyre using so many wellmeaning people for the cynical ends of amassing money and power
likely you have some nagging concerns about whats going on in society today why are women both liberated and spoiled  and sometimes even hostile cant the feminists see that things arent really so bad  sure youre all about tolerance and have lots of gay friends but you privately wonder if there should be sensible limits  you might be uncomfortable with all the evangelizing of alternative lifestyles especially if you have children in school
you consider the press to be the bedrock of a free society but you have doubts about journalistic integrity  hey we understand the propaganda is everywhere even in shows for young children  the media has been feeding you bullshit all your life and we think their lying is rotten you deserve better than that
starting to reconsider 
a diehard social justice warrior will seethe with rage for me bringing up these uncomfortable facts even if youre a moderate you might be reluctant to consider any of this we understand rethinking deeply held beliefs is a painful process for so many things youll see that what youve been told is right is actually wrong and what is wrong is really right
many on the left have been there before and found their way out for me someone explained that im not responsible for the worlds problems its not your fault the endless attempts in college to ram opinions down my throat hardened my resolve others whove made the journey have different stories some got religion others realized that their past fanaticism has hurt others  some wondered why decades of costly social programs havent accomplished anything some came to see that preferential treatment in hiring decisions is anything but fairness
its in your best interests to purge the misconceptions and guilt trips from your mind still you dont have to abandon everything and embrace the polar opposite some have reached a synthesis position 
welcome to the other side 
if youve read this far with an open mindand checked out some of the referenced articlesthen you might be confused perhaps youre tempted to reject our message on the other hand you might be shocked and even angry about whats been going on in politics and society
we understand enlightenment is a painful process were here for you the truth hurts but well do the best we can to tell it like it is which is much more than can be said for what youll see on television ive merely scratched the surface here stick with us and youll see how deep the rabbit hole goes

1195,no title,"donald trump is the candidate for americans not special interests donald trump is the candidate for americans not special interests luke stranahan 
luke stranahan is an engineer by trade and an armed patriot by inclination he writes for return of kings as a leisure pursuit and an attempt to do his part to help reverse the slide into moral decrepitude of modern society follow him on twitter november   politics 
next tuesday is the american election and for better or for worse well pick the next president at that time assuming we dont get mired in voter fraud and recounts and well either brace for government mandated sjw enemas or bask in a temporary setback of those evil people but today i want to talk on trump once to match an article from last week and i intend to focus on how he is the american candidate as opposed to the special interest groups one 
i had a conversation last week with some people who acted as sjws but were later presented by a mutual friend as libertarian the discussion immediately went nasty with my opposition painting trump and anyone who supported him as a racist and a bigot upon trying to determine why two of the lefts ubiquitous labels were applied to me this time i learned that their perspective was unless you were universally for all special interest groups you were a bigot or a racist false dichotomy and the american nightmare 
the problem i found out was that these people have distilled the political spectrum down into a black or white situation either you want all refugees here from the middle east all the hispanics from any country south of the border to come here freely and citizenship for those already here and that any black people shot by police are just misunderstood and were turning their lives around or youre a racist theres simply no middle ground 
they dont understand that trump is not a special interest candidate by which i mean that he is not going to put any minority group ahead of the rest of us at our expense but he is not racist towards minorities or sexist towards women 
it is possible to be against illegal immigration but treat americans of hispanic ancestry as valued citizens whom you will represent it is possible to be against feminism affirmative action and the persecution of men for the profit of women yet still value american women as americans themselves it is possible to note that some black people cause a disproportionate amount of crime yet note that some police are racist and see that there are bad and good cops and bad and good black people 
the american dream is that all men are created equal and thats men as in humanity not just males it is not that all men are equal and theres a big difference to note here you have the same opportunities as everyone else when you are born with the exception of disability and i do not know anyone myself included that is against governmental aid for the disabled 
what we have instead is the american nightmare where the left uses government and taxes for the most inane of causes trying to fix any disadvantaged groups lot real or imagined so that things will be better they take from the producers and give to the nonproducers so that according to their idealistic vision they will suddenly become productive members of society or become addicted to the welfare tit and vote democrat for the rest of their lives the good of the country over that of the individual 
long gone are responsible democrats like kennedy who told us to ask what you can do for your country every recent democratic president from carter to obama and most of the democrat congressmen view the working middle class of the country as simply a group to exploit for their pet special interest groups trump is the first candidate in a long time who isnt for the blacks or the gays or the muslims or the feminists or whatever and that matters a lot 
the reason why not being for a special interest group which is all that hillary is for with her youth vote black vote womens vote gay vote etc is so important is that these groups even put together do not matter when it comes down to the good of the country dont get me wrong theres plenty of good hardworking black people just like theres the same for women and for gays and for young people but these hardworking folks from all these groups arent going to be part of the blm or la raza or lamda because theyre too busy being productive americans activism is for unemployed people 
whats going to happen if we dont placate blm and just ignore them they riot a bit more and some get arrested what if we told them that people that commit crimes to protest being treated like they commit a lot of crimes is assbackwards thinking and counterproductive to their goals theyd quit rioting 
what would happen if we shut the mexican border down to illegal immigration but made a straightforward but strict path to citizenship for hispanics that wanted to be citizens what if we said this is america we appreciate your culture and encourage to preserve it and your language in your children but the national language is english and all business and schooling will be done in it and in it only and its your choice to not learn it but the difficulties that will arise from that choice are all on you theyd be americans proud of their heritage and their legal immigration and citizenship as well 
what would happen if we told gay people that its cool if they have civil unions under the law and have the same rights as everyone else but its not cool trying to pick a fight with a christian bakery to make the government hall monitor come drive them out of business just because their belief in their god and that youre sinning makes you uneasy and worried that they might actually be right 
what if we told them its ok to do whatever you want with another consenting adult but you dont have to try to make fiveyearolds decide if theyre gay or straight when they shouldnt be wondering about that till puberty hits theyd be normal americans who just happen to like sex with the same gender and theyd quit pushing their agenda and being obnoxious and in the rest of our faces 
what would happen if we talked to muslims and said that there is a huge deafening silence when it comes to the subject of islamic terrorism from them that makes it hard to trust any of them what if we told them that we needed their help to bring the religion out of its tacit acceptance and support of terrorism and part of that help means supporting us vetting muslims coming here more strictly until they are no longer statistically more likely to be terrorists than people of other religions and ethnicities theyd go along with that and maybe realize were fixing a problem not hating a people 
what would happen if we told women that feminism has all but killed modern marriage due to universal punishment of divorced men and that no punishment for falserape accusers both makes men not trust women and insults any real rape survivor what would happen if we told them that giving them jobs for their genitalia over their skills is destroying industries by lowering the only standard that matters that of merit that of excellence 
what if we told them that gender ratios and quotas may fix the macro view of sexism but make the man passed over for the position solely because you were female pissed as all hell towards women and when you do that to the majority of men youll be just as successful and just as hated by men as men were and were hated by you in years past theyd realize that its not a competition its a cooperation and maybe skill should be valued over sex 
what would happen if we stopped all these divisive issues that really dont do anything other than tear us apart and work on a better economy on rights for all on border security what would happen if we simply looked at each other as americans and put us all of us first what would happen if we ripped out the crap in the federal government that overtaxes people or deploys armed forces against our own countrymen what would happen if we made the supreme court constitutional again and made term limits a reality for congress maybe we could get a government for by and of the people again maybe america can indeed by great again like the man says conclusion 
im not in a special interest group no president outside of george w bush right after the september th attacks that i can recall since my childhood has been for me as an american ive always been someone to be taxed to be disarmed to be hated to be blamed its not racism or bigotry to want us all to be treated as equals and not be penalized for real and imagined wrongs that occurred in the past before i was born or more recently yet with which i had nothing to do 
im not part of the problem im an american the people who say i am part of the problem are the problem their candidate mired in scandal corruption and treason is hillary clinton mine with a message of hope for the country not just some groups in it is donald trump",2016-10-26
1196,no title,"whether you are looking to attract a longterm girlfriend or wife or you are experimenting with shorterterm liaisons learning the art of seduction is essential reams of content have been written on the topic both on rok and elsewhere indeed its possible to get lost in a tsunami of pickup advice
but while it can be useful to absorb successful peoples techniques a shortcut is to observe their habits and adopt them yourself to that end here is a list of the top five habits ive observed in men who are great with women
 they take every opportunity 
guys who are great with women recognize and take up every opportunity that is presented to them in this way they are somewhat akin to entrepreneurs they know that the market is in a constant state of flux and that change is at the heart of opportunity as such like the speculators of pussy they are they are never afraid to launch a takeover bid regardless of the circumstances
game writers will often advise men that they should be approaching all the time i would wholeheartedly endorse this i would also add that however many opportunities youre taking now there are always more to be had i for example will try to get my first approach of the day in in the morning while im traveling to my office on the subway there are so many cute girls on their way to work in london or any reasonablysized commuter city and yet guys wont talk to them rationalizing that it is too early shell think im crazy or whatever in actual fact ive probably taken more phone numbers and set up more dates through morning approaches than at any other time
so next time you are out and about and see an attractive girl be sure to approach her whatever the time or the circumstances it is only by being present and open to all prospects that you will truly optimize your game
 they notice and follow up on iois 
while most game advice is centered on what the guy should do in order to attract the girl the fact remains that there will be many times that girls will shoot you socalled indicators of interest or iois without you having done anything
while i would never advise anyone to rely on these as a mainstay i would counsel that you should always at least do your best to notice them and to follow up with alacrity not only do direct iois frequently lead to sex but also if you fail to pursue a potentiallyinterested girl you may find yourself regretting it for a long time afterwards men after all are the more romantic gender there are few more lasting selfinflicted wounds than the thought of that beautiful girl who smiled at you at the museum and who you just know you could have dated had you had the courage to speak to her
the successful seducer is always on the lookout for iois therefore and hell execute quickly when he gets them even if it means deviating slightly from his routine for example a while back i was on a subway train when i got strong direct eye contact from an attractive petite and very feminine brunettejust my type once youve been in the game a while you will learn to distinguish a solid ioi from casual interest but the best way to describe it is as that rabbit in the headlights look that girls give when they are truly smitten
well she was giving me that look and i knew i had to follow up when she got of the train i went right after her introduced myself on the platform took her number and then left a drink and then several awesome sex sessions ensued later had i not taken the time to go after her then we would never have connected
remember always be willing to go after a sure thing and never leave money on the table
 they stand out from the crowd 
every truly successful seducer i have ever known has found ways to differentiate himself and stand out from the crowd this can manifest itself in many ways but primarily im talking about standing out physically in terms of what you wear and standing out in terms of your personality
while the old concept of peacocking is rightly maligned by both men and women these days there can nevertheless be little argument with the fact that all else being equal the better dressed man will be more successful than his slacksandsweatshirt counterpart a former colleague of mine who has slept with more women than anyone else ive ever met was particular about his clothes to the point of obsession
i appreciate that this will immediately cause some people to question his masculinity what real man takes so much care over his clothes but remember that narcissism is one of the three dark triad characteristics that are like catnip to women along with machiavellianism and psychopathy therefore taking time to select a silk pocket square that contrasts dramatically with your blazer plus the right trousers and shoes will help your cause a lotif you remember that your main aim is to stand out rather than blend in
your personality too should be larger than life dont be obnoxious but as a rule of thumb try to ensure that you are louder and have more to say than the other men in the group
 they are dominant 
there can be no doubt that women are attracted to masculine men and that means that to be a contender you need to be dominant now of course the massive and blatantly obvious caveat here is that you should also be ultimately respectful and appreciate that no means no nevertheless within these boundaries it will serve you well to ensure that your body language your tone of voice and your general demeanor communicates dominance  both of the woman you are interacting with as well as any men in your vicinity
the key thing here is to appear decisive and unwaveringeven if secretly you arent for example after youve had a couple of drinks with a girl on a date try getting up taking her by the hand and simply leading her to a taxi when she questions what youre doing just say were going back to my place to watch a movie doing this will communicate that you have had similar success with women before and that you are not intimidated by her
now in the back of your mind you may well be uncertain that she will acquiesce and thats fine  just do the actions anyway and see what happens shes much more likely to want to go home with you if you demonstrate leadership and even if she doesnt she will still respect you more which will pay dividends the next time you meet
 they dont apologize 
highly successful seducers never apologizeor certainly not for minor social infractions anyway the fact of the matter is you cant make an omelette without breaking eggs if you are the kind of guy who frequently approaches women while demonstrating leadership and a certain kind of cockyfunny humor then the chances are youre going to offend someone every so often
now im not recommending that you should be a dickbe classy and convivial in all your interactions but the truth of the matter is that the real seducer always ruffles a few feathers in his quest for vaginal valhalla if someone gets offended then make a joke but dont apologize as long as have acted lawfully then you have nothing to be sorry for
remember an apology is a submission to someone elses frameand that is never a good look

1197,no title,"not since the miniskirt has there been something worn by so many women who should never have it on in the first place 
 alan sorrentino a sexagenarian gay man in his letter to a local rhode island newspaper
a senior citizen and selfdescribed short little gay italian in rhode island has been the victim of a vicious intimidation campaign by feminists with too much time on their hands after he wrote a newspaper letter saying that women over  should not wear yoga pants the backlash against alan sorrentino was vitriolic  women marched on his home which was publicly shared using the excuse that it was just a neighborhood protest
in retaliation for exercising his first amendment rights which you might have incorrectly thought encouraged violence given the heavyhanded feminist response sorrentino received threatening calls and explicit death threats publications such as the washington post regarded the shameful intimidation of an old man as some kind of fun outing rabid social media users and the protesters themselves also lost sight of the context of sorrentinos letter and later comments which pointed out that men rocking up to supermarkets in speedos would be considered inappropriate too
violent gay man whose fashion prescriptions in a newspaper reaching only a few thousand people are capable of disemboweling feminists and ejecting them into space
if anything the moronic march on sorrentinos home and throughout his neighborhood demonstrates the paucity of real issues women have to complain about for all the talk of the misogyny and patriarchy that triggered the march pun intended these women were able to assemble freely in one of the most liberal states in america and harass without interruption an old white male albeit not a straight one they evidently did not feel the fear they continually reference in their diatribes where were the saudistyle female dress code police or the rape squads of the rape culture they always talk about to teach them a lesson alas the dastardly misogyny and patriarchy must have chosen to remain invisible again
women tell men what to wear all the time i didnt see anyone staking out jennie prices home for telling her husband and other men what to wear image attribution martin spaven
it goes without saying that one of the biggest criticisms leveled by women towards their boyfriends or husbands is their allegedly bad fashion sense even beyond their relationships women have a penchant for sticking their noses into what a man wears from his sporting clothing and clubbing attire to his choice of bathing suit here in australia an entire media subindustry emerged to criticize our former conservative prime minister tony abbott for wearing socalled budgie smugglers whilst swimming and keeping fit
because alan sorrentino had  women obviously stalk his home for his fashion comments should men have stalked the residence of one jennie price a hack journalist from the daily mail  instead of celebrating her husbands decision to resist middleage decline and obesity through cycling price penned a ridiculous piece in  decrying socalled mamils middleaged men in lycra
she joined bbc journalist dominic casciani who equated men taking up the amateur sport with a midlife crisis  notwithstanding that men in lycra wouldnt get i or my readers off at least men wearing this fabric actually engage in exercise when they don it in the morning too when fewer folks are awake to see them by contrast yoga pants seem to be the default female fashion option for nonexercise more than physical exertion or even yoga
naturally had just three guys  let alone  or  made their intention to protestcycle their way through jennie prices neighborhood in britain the police would have been called the same can be said of any of the countless female journalists and female fashion experts who have opined on what men should or should not wear and lets not forget women telling each other what to wear a number of females make their careers out of critiquing what other women wear especially on the celebrity red carpet i wonder how many times for example then zombie and now dead zombie joan rivers found her home marched on by offended feminists after she berated either a piece of female fashion attire or the women wearing it
sending a tweet is violence but  people marching on someones house is notwhat world do we live in the national debt nah terrorism nah urban crime nah these folks are protesting fashion comments
at the start of this year i brought you the story of holly michelle wood  a putrid harvard phd candidate and feminist who went around calling white people awful after the now banned milo yiannopoulos simply retweeted woods criticisms of him fellow feminist catrin cooper used the cyber violence argument and tried to get a twitter stooge michael margolis to alert its founder jack dorsey we would not have the time to go through even a relatively small fraction of the other instances in which women who cannot argue their position online reframe criticism as misogyny or even outright violence
as alan sorrentino clearly feared for his safety during the march potentially hundreds or thousands of women gave themselves excuses for calling some man disagreeing with them online or in person violent a climate now exists where whatever words certain women finds offensive becomes the basis for stopping whatever theyre doing presumably not much and going after the person saying them in the most organized and appalling fashion
at a minimum the target of their fury must lose his job reputation and sense of personal safety to satiate their desire for revenge in the meantime the very act of their protest and abuse which is not interfered with validates the idea that women are not the targets of systematic hate or oppression in society
as a gender women particularly the middle and upper middleclass women who seem to dominate these kinds of pointless abusive protests have nothing to complain about except maybe having too much time on their hands

1198,obsolete,"home this month popular  things indian guys have to understand when learning game  things indian guys have to understand when learning game february    comments culture 
as a guy of indian ethnicity there are some obstacles you have to overcome in order to have a balanced game circumstances can dictate what these are but following my last post a red pill infused indian pal of mine and myself had a conversation about what these obstacles are  let go of limiting beliefs about being an indian in the western world 
what do i mean by limiting beliefs there is a particular mindset among indian guys that they can only get with indian girls you must let go of these fears dictating that your ethnicity holds you back in what you can do being indian does not mean you have to work in it accounting business construction or own a corner shop as in the same way it does not mean you have to date indian girls  let go of your mummys sari 
its something ive noticed among the large indian community here in london there are a large number of mummys boys men who are afraid to stand up to their mothers and what they want themselves no one wants to disrespect their parents but also at the same time standing up for what you want should be your primary objective many a man will settle with their girlfriends due to pressure from their mothers as one acquaintance said he preempted conflict by just doing what his mother wanted even though he does not love the girl he married  let go and expand beyond your indian comfort zone 
your extended family plays a large part of your life not a bad thing but a lot of guys also have their friends circle exclusively indian expand your knowledge gain new friends travel and learn new languages its a difficult transition to move from becoming over reliant on this little setup to independence from all influence but it can be done and it will benefit your internal well being the thing to remember is you are the average of the five people you spend most of your time with it is highly likely none of your existing five friends will agree with your path into game they will tell what is best for you but in essence this is them subconsciously pulling you back down to their value as you increase your own  stop putting white women on a pedestal 
white women are easy white women are fun white women are flirts white women are great at sex or white women are sluts whatever white women are as an indian guy you must stop putting them on a pedestal for being all these sexually related things that you think indian girls are not there is no magical things that white women do that others do not besides there is not a certain place in the world where white women will see you and jump on your cock as there is not a certain bollywood film that will make a white woman gush all wet and demand you ravage her aryan style white woman pedestalization can be categorized as an inferiority complex displayed by indian men stop thinking youre inferior to any woman regardless of her ethnicracial origins  understand that indian girls are not different and are not more chaste 
being constantly around these indian girls at family gatherings community events and religious events makes you programmed into believing that you will marry one for certain because of their chaste and low promiscuity a strong belief that indian girls dont ride the cock carousel is blind faith because they do in fact all women in the western world do regardless of culture and their strong family traditional values they are women they get pussy tingles to the same game as white black asian orange maroon and kiwi women they have the same subconscious processes as all women that help them place a value on a man and inevitable slamming and spunk gobbling if he passes with flying colors in a western society these girls have the same external pressures and influences that appeal to their inner slut as much as any other woman your objective as a man is not to fall into the line of romantic thinking that they are different  do not be afraid of the man 
theres a man a dominant man somewhere in your family he dictates he dominates and he makes the decisions you have a fear of causing him displeasure you do as he says as hes done the leading since your father emptied his ball sack into your mother stop as much as a lot of indian men have pressures from being mummys little lad theres plenty of them that disintegrate under the pressure of their fathers or uncles avoiding conflict is prevalent in your attitude you do as you are told even though your mind is telling you this is not in your interest and possibly not in the wider interests of those close to you but you do it as uncle or dad has told you to 
no one is telling you to fight but start slowly speak out say what you think is best for you get out of your shell and decide how you will live your life not how dad thinks you should live your life you might be scared of the conflict and dissuade yourself from it but trust me when you finally grow some balls and exude some confidence and ability in yourself these men will respect you see you as equal and place trust in your decisions 
this list could also apply to other cultures who follow similar dynamics to indian culture but dont stop at the above and think thats all you have to doyou still have to hit the ground running and approach just like any other guy learning game",2016-10-26
1199,no title,"anyone whos been involved in the manosphere for long enough knows about the concept of a rite of passage for tens of thousands of years when boys hit the age of puberty they were forced to undergo a set of challenges
these challenges were meant to break them down and build them back up even stronger these challenges were meant to test them as men and they are collectively known as an initiation or as a rite of passage when a boy successfully completed the tasks laid before him he became a man
our society for the most part lacks these rites of passage this is in large part why there is such a lack of masculinity in our culture boys are never given a chance to develop into men we have all of these  year old boyishmen running around for a reason there exists no institutionalized rite of passage in the west
despite this however i believe that learning game is a form of initiation it contains all of the traits necessary to turn a boy into a man it teaches boys to develop selfconfidence  despite what women think of them to become decisive and assertive and to remain persistent and cultivate strength of will

one of the primary functions of a rite of passage is that it destroys a boys ego this is necessary for in order for him to become a man his identification with boyhood must be destroyed in other words he must cease to view himself as a boy and come to view himself as a man
this is in a nutshell what most of the rites of passage were designed to dothis is why many of them simulated death in a rather bellyofthewhaleesque fashion one rite of passage of the aborigines to be specific entailed kidnapping a young boy from his mother
when a boy would reach the age of puberty the men of the village would sneak into his home during the night and kidnap him his mother would put on a big show screaming and fighting to make it seem realistic the men would blindfold the boy and take him to the middle of the woods
he would then spend the next several months undergoing challenges he would not see a single woman for this period of time this sudden yanking from the motherworld of safety and being thrust into the fatherworld of dangerous challenges symbolized his death as a boy
when the boy returned home he would view himself as a man he would carry himself taller he would interact with the women differently and he would have a new sense of purpose in many ways as i will soon explain game does all of these things for the men willing to learn it
facing fears 
many of these challenges that boys were forced to face involved overcoming their fears fear of death fear of the unknown and fear of failure were all overcome during these rites of passage as an example one native american rite of passage involved making a boy sit blindfolded on a tree trunk for three days straight
imagine his fear as he heard the various animals during the night the howling the cawing and the roaring of the animals alone would be enough to terrify even the bravest of men then add in the elements of cold and wind the bugs that must have crawled over his feet and the fear of a rival tribe member killing him and it becomes very apparent how brave the men of the past must have been
then once three days had passed a man of the village would come and remove the boys blindfold this again is symbolic of his rebirth for three days straight he was blind and helpless then his vision returned and he emerged a new man
all throughout the rites of passage of history whether they be of the inuits the amazon tribes or the south african tribes there are some very common characteristics facing your fear being reborn and coping with uncertainty are all critical parts of these initiations
why were these rituals necessary 
upon contemplation it becomes very clear why these rituals were necessary the world that we live in is radically different than the world that our ancestors lived in a tribe of weak men meant extinction there was no military or safety if the men could not protect the tribe it would not be protected
imagine right now if a marauding band of  vandals roamed into your neighborhood they were all extremely jacked mean looking and each one was carrying some sort of weapon a baseball bat a stick or a crowbar do you think that you and your neighbors would have the balls to fight them off
you being a reader of rok may very well fight a noble fightbut your neighbors i seriously doubt that a purplehaired complaining selfcastrating feminist man would be of any use during a battle such as this
now try to imagine that this sort of thing happened fairly regularly for our ancestors it was not uncommon for neighboring tribes to frequently attack you so it was an absolute necessity that the men be trained for battle but being trained for battle requires more than physical strength
it requires ferocity it requires strength of will decisiveness assertiveness and a complete lack of fear these are the characteristics that rites of passage were meant to breed for without them a tribe would go extinct
are these rituals still necessary 
someone might point out that we arent at war anymore so these rituals arent necessary although i agree that we arent in a state of constant warfare anymore i still believe that these rites of passage are extremely necessary heres why
men and women both have distinct psychological makeups there is no denying this no matter how hard the marxists cry and clamor men and women are different boys have an inherent desire to be a part of something greater than themselves namely a tribe boys have an inherent desire to be welcomed into the world of menand we arent getting it because there isnt even a world of men anymore
the once sacred separation of the genders has been desecrated only a select handful of mens organizations still exist the manosphere the freemasons and various other spiritual organizations it used to be commonplace for gentlemans organizations to exist everywhere but theyve become a thing of the past
this is why in large part were experiencing such a crisis of masculinity men dont know who they are anymore we dont have any healthy male role models all weve got is weak men who justify their weakness with feel good aphorisms we want more but we dont get more
any man who is attuned to this can feel it he can feel the general sense of boyishness that the adulthood of men seems to hold onto theres no chance for us to prove ourselves theres no dragons to slay no enemies to fight off and no fears to overcome
and were suffering we can feel it in our bones not only are men unnecessary but we dont even have opportunities to grow and develop like the men of the past we dont have any initiations or male guidance no men to reassure our belonging in the tribe no obstacles to face
learning game the new initiation 
i believe that although it isnt perfect game is a phenomenal substitute for this lack of a male initiation ritual game provides us with many of the characteristics that you need to be a man and it has many of the characteristics that the old rituals of the past did
destroys your ego requires you to face your fears forces you to be decisive in times of uncertainty develops confidence ferocity and a strong will again obviously game isnt perfect one could certainly make the argument that ones masculinity shouldnt be contingent upon what women think and i agree  but do you know what you may get into game for womens approval but any seasoned player knows that you actually stay in the game for your own personal growth
when men first start learning game they get into it because their sex life isnt what they want it to be they think that learning game will get them girls and it does but something happens along the waythey start getting all of the sex that they could ever want and they realize that game has changed them on a deeper level
game provides you with an outlet to overcome your anxiety and to live life fearlessly  by consistently going out and facing your fears of rejection you develop a certain fearless mindset that bleeds into other areas of your life
learning game creates a wholepersonality transformation that cannot be found anywhere else no other hobby outlet or activity will change you as much as game does aside from an actual initiation conducted by the men of the past
game makes you a man 
game will transform you from a boy into a man for a vast number of reasons first off game demolishes your ego  a lot of men have this delusion that they could get any hot girl that they want but they are forced to face reality when they actually go out and try to pull girls
this is why so many men hate game and cant handle it youre forced to face reality very quickly and most men cant take this when you start to go out and learn game you have one of two choices
accept that you suck with girls and keep trying to improve viscerally deny reality and perpetuate your delusions by never going out and experiencing rejection most men choose the latter their ego is far too precious and they cant handle it being challenged those men who do have the courage to demolish their ego however will end up bedding women more gorgeous than they ever imagined take my word for it
second learning game requires you to face your fears think of how many men have approach anxiety nowadays do you think that this underlying anxiety might bleed into other areas of their life of course so once you overcome your approach anxiety in pickup this fearlessness will bleed into other areas of your life in other words youre starting to develop a totally new personality that isnt afraid of living life and taking risks
game forces you to be decisive in times of uncertainty a lot of the time in fact most of the time you dont know whether or not a girls friends will be okay with you you dont know if she has a boyfriend you dont know if she lives nearby you dont know this you dont know that when it comes to game theres a lot of uncertainty
this is why learning game teaches you to accept uncertainty and make take decisive action in the face of it what other skill could be more masculine the men of the past revered this skill because its what their entire livelihood was based around
you see a pack of deer  feet away you dont know if you can kill them or not should you take the risk an enemy tribe is attacking should you run to your hut and get a better weapon or pick up a rock and do what you can youre injured and alone but you see a nearby village should you ask them for help would they kill you or heal you
learning to take decisive action in the face of uncertainty was a skill that every man had for millenia his life depended on it now the only way to cultivate this skill is through game or other more extreme measures such as fighting in a war or something although even then you wont have much freedom to make decisions
all in all game will take you from a boy to a man it will teach you to be confident and to become completely detached from either rejection or acceptance from women it will help you to develop assertiveness and social calibration
most importantly however it will teach you to overcome your fears in the words of my favorite pickup mentor learning game is an odyssey of the mind it teaches you to overcome your fears to face your lingering negative beliefs and to grow as a man our society gives us no right of passage so weve created our own go out and learn game for it will change your life

1200,no title,"lately gunfree zones and gun control laws are all the rage among the globalists and liberals of all shapes usually circular and sizes 
those measures solely aimed at disarming the people and depriving them of the sacred right to defend themselves has shown its vast ineffiency with gun victims and terrorist attacks on the rise in those zones since no honest citizen can shoot back to stop the massacre
here is why i propose once a conservative government reaches the white house to create fat control laws fcl and obesityfree zones ofz as obesity is indeed a more serious threat to the lives of americans than honest citizens carrying legally purchased guns here are six potential benefits
 simple philanthropy 
obese people are delusional thinking that it is great to be a useless sack of shit nowadays they get fed a distorted reality saying that big and round is beautiful when the natural reaction deeply branded in our dna is disgust mockery and suspicion
fat and sedentary lifestyles kill much more than guns  the war against obesity is as important as the war on crime or drugs bovine people not only harm themselves but others too by creating measures to prevent them from becoming fat or exhorting them lose weight we are helping our common man to preserve his dignity as a human being
in their case sugar and salt create a dopamine rush and an addiction loop very similar to an addiction to opiates we must show our potbellied or barrelbellied junkies the way as they cant take the steps themselves
just like with restrictions on cigarettes if they are stupid enough to gorge themselves on calories we must conclude that there is a severe lack of judgement on their part and prevent them from purchasing the source of their misery
 preserving aesthetics and other senses 
no more eyesore of seeing fatties rolling around everywhere you go imagine a beach with a plethora of more feminine attractive and thin women by banning whales in bikinis
our nostrils would also be free of the olfactory offence that they throw in our faces say goodbye to the pungent smell of fat rolls sweat at your local grocery store
no more lb sjw land whales with laboured breath sounds in waiting rooms or uncontrolled farting in the public transport like you are in a cattle train it could be tomorrow
 positive impact on children 
i do not want these people to roam free and that my future progeny can witness it and think that this is normal worse if the pc politburo tells them it is beautiful to be a beached whale lets send them far until they get better out of sight out of mind as they say
legal elements should be implemented against pernicious publicity aired on television and directly aimed at children whether by the time chosen to air it or the promotion it makes of unhealthy eating
of course with fat control policies kids will get bullied at school some will cut themselves for being called fattie so what adapt and overcome or crawl in a ball and cry the weakest has to be left behind if he does not want to save himself
 a healthier population you are under arrest for being an immovable gargantuan arsehole
fat is not a silent killer hundreds of thousands of people die with a loud thud every year of obesityrelated diseases a largely preventable cause of death worldwide today  in  americans and  in  britons dies from being a fat arse with no selfcontrol
it is a fact that obesity causes death by cardiac arrest diabetes coronary and liver diseases cancer and hypertension among others promoting a healthy lifestyle and physical activity will create a longer life expectancy
physically healthier people are mentally healthier too boost of selfesteem and confidence fat control laws will reduce mental health issues such as depression inferiority complex or suicidal tendencies caused by obesity that is also less money spent by the taxpayer
 a boost for the economy 
according to a  report ham planets cost the economy  billion a year  and that is for the american economy alone the number of human cattle is still growing exponentially it inflicted more than a  billion loss to the economy in 
in  we can reasonably assume that the number of obese people has grown and has impacted the wallet of your average american even harder
a fitter population with its nutritional choices would result in a more natural higherquality food industry smaller amounts of food produced and needed resulting in reduced resources and materials wasted during and after its production
we could see the end of excessive fossil fuel used to transport land walruses and their fat arse across long distances and hogging the space that could be use by three normal individuals
healthier more active people are happier more productive and successful since the cogs of the machinery are not coated in fat an age of stronger selfgoverned highenergy men bringing a healthier society its yuge
 a new sexual and romantic market 
it will bring a more balanced sexual arena to limit the accumulation of fat a radical answer to the phenomenon of plummeting testosterone levels caused by high fat percentage trimming the numbers of plump omegas and sexual market voluntary rejects
lets impose a healthier diet for higher numbers of attractive thin and pretty women greater numbers of quality girls to choose from reduces aggressive competition which decreases the bitch shields of thin entitled girls
endless supplies of betas queuing to capture crumbs of their attention would be a thing of the past as i said it before male thirst is the root of all evil when it comes to romantic competition
sexier citizens means more relationships a peak in libido and reproduction of physically and mentally balanced individual helping nations suffering from low birth rate
one more element for the protection of western society being the most affected one and its people cementing the bases of a strong future fighting globalism and the myth they try to sell us about global overpopulation
by logical natural process bronies corpulent manchildren and manga conventions should also disappear soon
the fat control laws  segregated obesityfree zones 
our diabetic mammoths must be isolated from further propaganda and tasty treats
this is why we should create large very large fenced areas to protect the healthy subjects as fat is more dangerous than guns
lets pen the bigboned rejects in separated zones where access to junk food and other harmful products would be forbidden fresh water open spaces salad and treadmills as far as the eye could see
build that fence
we shall call it the david fatrelle center for porcine rehabilitation
 permits 
a permit would have to be issued similar to a guncarrying permit for the purchase of junk food highcarb snacks soda drinks etc after a doctors physical exam of the patient slim citizens would be delivered a permit with a stamp of approval granting them access to supermarkets or venues where processed or junk food is served
 mandatory workouts 
compulsory exercise would be imposed to obese people to reach a standard bmi we could bring it up a notch where a fine could be issued after a determined period of time if the weight loss target has not been reached
a steps counter activity tracker would have to be worn or installed on their smartphone and a quota of physical activity would have to be reached on a day to day basis
just like the programs for convicted criminals or drug abusers with reports to the local police station on a regular basis the stubbornly chunky would be followed during a rehabilitation stage and their progress monitored
 fat shaming 
fat shaming works great as we have seen before  remember the shitstorm of the beach body campaign  immediately declared thought criminals by the body positive lobby or islamic thought tribunal of londonistan
or the coldblooded leaflets given by anonymous though criminals to particularly adipose london tube passengers yuge success
pourquoi ça nexiste pas 
fat people are a dead weight to society in all senses of the term and to compensate this burden they must chip in one way or another and repair the harm they cause
fitter people means a selfaware powerful mass that strives for greatness
but the liberals in charge dont want that this is why they produce massive amounts of harmful processed food and encourage the pleb by manipulating publicity and promoting makebelieve to remain fat weak and above all docile
its all part of a plan fat control laws are the answer to that great evil

1201,no title," more emotions men should master  more emotions men should master 
andré is a young european who left his decaying country in  for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november   mind 
passions and emotions are an almost bottomless pit start digging there and you will find new ones or new relations between this and that tidbit of emotional content socalled enlightenment philosophers who tried to theorize the passionssomething that had been done at greater length actually by thomas aquinascould never agree on how many there were or even how much they exactly mattered in the course of life 
whether or not you have been reading my last two pieces on the topic remember this is about mastering passions in the most general sense this is not only about emotional restraint or seduction our own emotional states are the first in line but mastering the passions is also about spotting what other people are feeling how they can be led to a specific course of action and what tends to make them tick mastering the passions is far from evident it rather takes times and experience the concepts and directions i am providing here aim at giving some conscious clarity about things that are by nature a bit muddy 
artists though they often suffer from mental problems are skilled at painting a particular vision in vivid colours allowing their public to share a specific point of view and emotional state this is something the elite know very well critics trashed ayn rands atlas shrugged because they could see themselves painted there as passiveaggressive cultural parasites rands novel was more cogent and attracted more heat than her barely original philosophical pieces today sold at the cheapest price on the secondhand book market 
more recently the movie the fall  got backlashed by some of the mainstream media on the grounds that it depicted hitler as too human while seeing actor bruno ganz pondering eating talking to his closest company or getting angry the viewer could perhaps feel a bit of empathy to him which is of course unacceptable to a left that clings to the idea of a crazy careless inhuman dictator to be forever cast as an embodiment of evil hollywood directors do not like witnessing others competing with their own emotional mastery 
we need artists as well as qualified cultural critics to take some distance from the mainstream propaganda disguised as entertainment and expand an alternative culture and artworks emotions explored in the present series can be used just that way  gratitude 
gratitude denotes a trained and refined disposition being graceful means recognizing that the good in our life can come from something that is outside us and outside our control neel burton heaven and hell  chap p it focuses on positive things we already have and that cannot be ascribed to our sole merit or efforts 
the traditional world whatever the particular cultural or religious form it was embodied into always emphasized the necessity of being grateful you owed your existence to god to your family and your community none of these goods were actually deserved which meant you had to be grateful for them and repay them by being a dutiful member of the community as well as a dutiful father for your own children a lot of prayers and ancient rites imply a thanksgiving for what one already has 
moving later in time it is striking to see that modern progressivism breeds the exact opposite mindset the ideology of rights make many goods granted not a thank you for but an i have a right to neophilia the relentless pursuit of novelty always casts a bad shadow on what has been around for some time as if what was coming later was always better 
advertisement gossip culture economic growth pressure quest for victimhood lead to envy and always being more or less frustrated with what one already has regardless of what it is by leading us to always want more progressivism makes us oblivious to what we already have or how it does not stem from pure individual meritand when it flatters the ego it makes us complacent and far from cultivating the art of being thankful 
turning our backs from the modern ungraceful mindset is easier said than done to start with loudmouthed girls should be remembered they owe their nice luxurious workplaces to the men who built them lgbtbbq should thank their heterosexual parents and ancestors for their very lives antiwhite black activists should remember they would not even exist had their ancestors not benefited from their white colonizers healthcare technology feel free to expand the list ultimately i think every person who is modern or westernized enough can be outed as ungraceful for something  trust 
a famous study showed that multiculturalism was closely correlated with defiance and a lack of trust in each other provided that we enlarge a bit our definition of multiculturalism this absolutely makes sense some ethnic groups are especially prone to violence and some minority groups are rewarded for freely accusing the silent majority but the hegemony of political correctness made it a taboo communities have been fragmented by individualism ie each person looking to take as much as she can and by an antiracist white guilt that soon became an intrawhite generalized suspicion of racism people do not identify anymore with the larger society and often cannot even identify with a smaller communitywhich makes everyone else a potential enemy 
yet without trust life becomes unbearable if you cant go to the streets without the possibility of getting mugged by say blm activists  or go to a family meal without the prospect of a lukewarm struggle with aging leftist parents or have a relationship with a girl without the possibility of her making a false rape accusation  there arent a lot of things you can do on the long run without trust in other people you have to trust the complex of big corporations ngo and state institutions we call the systemand be dependent from it for things as basic as food and shelter 
only trust in each other can make life sustainable and longterm projects workable to recreate trust we have to make people accountable and bound to precise rules reward good behaviours while punishing bad ones actions must bear consequences but before neomasculinity gets into power men should strive to establish a reputation through reliability persistence and a strong mindset i could wager you have been more trusting of your facebook friends last years than of the mainstream media  the former conveying more trustworthy information than the latter  desire 
modern capitalism and progressivism always ran on desire want cheaper prices more goods better goods more tv channels to watch more monies more ego and thinking you are the hot shit well just buy in x or do some work for y and here it is um nah you just have to do some more and some more and some more in the end you forgot why exactly you are doing what youre doing or why you started to watch tv but it all started with you led to perform something no matter how surreptitiously framed as spontaneous or normal it was 
the system plays on desires in three ways it sets things to be desired things to be feared or never desired at all and things to be consummated without end things to be desired include everything the advertisement wants you to desire like a revolving credit a new sofa an suv or whatever as well as the next step of  progress  as it has been elaborated on the top of the pyramid 
things to be feared are where the system wants you to be resigned and fatalistic did you ever feel sad to see all these girls losing themselves into a sea of fat bitching and sjwpropaganda spouting too bad thats globalization resistance is futile move on at last things to be consummated are mainly produced to keep you busy and programmed though you are not really practising anything beyond staring at a screen 
lately an important shift has been happening between the first and third ways to play on desires decades before the average consumer had to desire owning more junk or being part of the progress the system needed him to work and monitor his peers today the junk is already everywhere pc culture is already hegemonic and the average american worker is no longer needed active desire is not needed anymore 
thus the system has shifted into making the average joe more passive instead of actually desiring more the consumer should be content with surrogates of everythingpseudogroup identity with team sports pseudosports with football and basket on tv pseudosex with porn pseudolife with video games pseudofamily life with animals pseudoexpertise when the average libtard obnoxiously parrots the media on everything this is brzezinskis tittytainment in a nutshell 
even if you dont give up on having a real life instead of a surrogate the system will still want you to desire things only for yourself thus retreating into individualism instead of trying to actually weight on the world either you surrender to the progress or you try to ignore it before it comes for you as if nothing could change 
dont let the elite frame the world according to its own interests desire selfrealization and weighting on the course of the world of course our female counterparts should desire being loving caretaking and definitely on our side to conclude this series 
once again it is hard to sketch in a few words what could be done with passions or emotions what i have mostly dwelled into is how those already in power manipulate them and what we could do as to take them back if you find the topic worthy of interest you can expand it in two directions first documenting yourself on a particular passion or emotion and second using some by stirring it with a certain aim in mind 
in the former case i would recommend neel burtons heaven and hell quoted several times in the course of this series as a point of departure in the latter being creative or simply assertive is up to you whether this looks more like efforts or selfpersuasion or artistry does not matter much 
here as well as in seduction a tight framing is key whatever the topic no vocabulary and no picture are really neutral which is a problem as our perception and thinking orientation are often conditioned by these the mastery of emotions is reinforcedand reinforcesthe mastery of representations if this sounds farfetched let me provide some examples of use examples you are absolutely free to expand as it suits you 
in the comments space several guys here have been giving a very negative portrayal of the nice guy he would be a fake a sneaky bastard a jerk so guys who want to get laid or have their own interests just as everyone else are jerks this looks like internalized feminist thinking in my opinion nice guys should elicit empathy which goes through a positive portrayal emphasizing their willingness to respect the girl or how they were likely raised by an unmanly culture 
a recent rok piece about mainstream media has shown how these are making a conscious effort to hide and delegimitate white victimhood they paint vividly any crime where the victim is nonwhite and the perpetrator is but mention no detail or do not mention at all any crime perpetrated by nonwhites on whites 
the same pattern appears in the movie elysium  when the of course white villain mentions children she wants to protect from a mass of brown invaders yet these children are never shown and consequently stir no empathy from the average watcher whereas the brownskinned are vividly depicted as humane and not responsible for their own poverty 
analyzing these phenomena is fine but ultimately insufficient creative people on our side have to provide an alternative that includes mastered emotions picking up girls is part of and gives some experience in this wider game",2016-10-27
1202,no title,"the following post was sponsored by chad cocker and written by matt forney 
everyone says that you shouldnt judge a book by its cover but thats really difficult when the cover makes you throw up a little in your mouth thats how i felt when i was tasked with writing a review of chad t cockers memoirs of a misogynist an erotic novel for men  what kind of man would want to read an erotic novel romance and erotica are female masturbation material trying to write a harlequin novel men is like marketing lesbian porn to actual lesbians
or so i thought
despite the packaging memoirs of a misogynist is one of the best works ive read this year contrary to cockers marketing the novel is a examination of life as a man in modern america filtered through the protagonists relationships with women while it starts slowly cockers prose and honesty save the day and make memoirs of a misogynist absolutely worth your time and money
from the marquis de sade to neomasculinity 
because mainstream publishing almost exclusively caters to women underground and independent writers have turned to fill the void of malecentric literature from braggadocios fratire writers like tucker max and maddox to loser lit authors such as andy nowicki and ann sterzinger to our very own roosh and quintus curtius theres a surfeit of alternative writing for men who are sick of the misandry and feminism of the real literary world
viewed against the backdrop of alternative publishing memoirs of a misogynist is an odd animal indeed when i first picked it up i assumed it would be a tellall memoir along the lines of rooshs a dead bat in paraguay or a roman à clef in the fashion of charles bukowskis work however it does indeed live up to its subtitle as much of the novel is devoted to lengthy detailed descriptions of the protagonists sexual encounters
shed also gotten used to her chastity belt and that scared her it still didnt sit well with her that master had total control over her sexual gratification slave was constantly wet and horny and that made her even more compliant the orgasms that master gave her were unlike anything she had experienced before they were mindblowing even after a year together their sex was electric and deeply satisfying
in the introduction cocker warns us that the book is possibly the dirtiest most depraved and most offensive novel youve ever read making me wonder if hes ever heard of  days of sodom still the structure of memoirs plot and the skill of cockers prose shows that hes both acquainted with classic erotica and has actually had sex with a lot of girls the first half of the book is reminiscent of pauline reages story of o in which a woman is systematically trained to become a sex slave
interestingly memoirs of a misogynist also seems inspired by venus in furs not the velvet underground song but the erotic novel by leopold von sachermasoch its from sachermasoch that we derive the term masochism the tendency to derive sexual pleasure from pain akin to how sadism is derived from sade as the plot revolves around a man who desires nothing more than to be utterly subservient to his mistress severins humiliation at the hands of his lover drives him to become a misogynist in the same way that cockers protagonist is one
that woman as nature has created her and man at present is educating her is mans enemy she can only be his slave or his despot but never his companion this she can become only when she has the same rights as he and is his equal in education and work
its worth noting that sachermasoch was a feminist and believed that equal relationships with women would only become possible with womens liberation insert your own joke here
power doesnt care what you need as long as youre on your knees 
enjoying memoirs of a misogynist requires you to get past the initial few chapters which read like fifty shades of grey with about  extra iq points the initial plot concerns melinda a runaway who falls into the care of a wealthy man who goes unnamed for most of the book after offering her room and board the man and melinda begin a relationship sealed by a contract where she agrees to become his sexual plaything
my body is my masters it is his blank canvas for him to modify as many times and in as many different ways as he chooses he could hear her breath quickening as he read he will control my bodily functions most particularly my orgasms i will only orgasm when my master allows me 
what saves the bookand what kept me readingwas its depiction of the protagonist henceforth referred to as master far from the masturbatory blank slate that christian grey was cocker depicts master as a complex and conflicted character constantly trying to rationalize the way he treats melinda later rechristened slave cockers deft writing kept me wondering what the protagonists motivations were all the way to the end the book also frequently switches to melindas perspective while its usually a challenge for male writers to depict female characters and vice versa cocker is skilled enough to make her compelling as well
where memoirs really picks up is in the second half which is set nearly ten years later the focus shifts to elizabeth avery a disgraced doctor stripped of her medical license after shes caught abusing a male patient destitute and despondent she accepts a job as the personal physician of masters stable of whores his lifestyle offending her feminist sensibilities
doctor averys world was spinning she tried to distance herself this was just a patient after all she was being paid a significant amount of money for this jobthe kind of money that would solve a lot of her problems regardless she couldnt help but be disgusted that a woman had allowed herself to be treated this way hed said she consented to this in fact the way she looked at the man showed she clearly loved him and was a willing participant in her modifications and degradation the woman or melinda as the man had called her looked up at him with what the doctor could only call adoration
once again it would have been easy for cocker to depict elizabeth as a raging braburning feminist stereotype but he agilely avoids clichés in favor of nuance elizabeth isnt portrayed as a firebreathing misandrist but as a woman who unthinkingly absorbs leftist cant and has her life ruined because of it the final chapters of the book show elizabeth tussling with the sexual arousal she feels working for mr x her name for the protagonist and her attempts to maintain her beliefs as the evidence of her failed life piles up i wont spoil the ending other than to say that after finishing the book i had to sit on it and digest it for a few days
each chapter of memoirs begins with a factual statistic about the state of men and boys in america today a jarring contrast with the depravity of the books action i initially wondered why they were there but as i approached the end of the book it all suddenly clicked memoirs of a misogynist is a biting look at what our toxic sexual marketplace does to men and women american dating is like an acid bath no one who dives into it comes out unscathed even men who are successful at getting laid are affected by what they have to do to get ahead there are no winners no saints and no role models just people trying to make the best of a broken system
as i stated earlier memoirs takes a while to really get going and if youre not into lascivious descriptions of sex the book wont appeal to you but if you want a haunting piercing look at the horror show of modern gender relations memoirs of a misogynist is a mustbuy i cant wait to see what cocker comes up with next

1203,no title,"home this month popular  tips for having sex with croatian girls  tips for having sex with croatian girls february    comments travel day game 
 croatian girls are extremely receptive to day game they want to be opened even if she has headphones and seems focused on her music it can still go well same goes for girls on rollerblades excuse me where can i buy rollerblades like yours 
 croatia is one of those places where both indirect and direct game work pick one that suits the venue and your personality what i did was open indirect chat for a couple minutes and then hit her with a compliment about her positive energy to see how shed respond if she smiled i knew i was in 
 girls will give you their number even if they have a boyfriend it may not come out until the first meeting to avoid this when i was getting a number id jokingly say youre not married right if she had a boyfriend she would then announce it with a guilty look on her face 
 always go for the instadate especially if youre doing street game not only will this weed out flakey girls but it gives you an opportunity to find out what she wants in life croatia has a lot of good girls who dont drink at all and want a serious relationship you want to dump those prospects if youre not staying long 
 a common issue youll find on the first date is girls who want to bring their friends along dont let them or youll get stuck in a hellish group chat its either a on date or nothing night game 
 you need to push the interaction as far as you can go if you dont at least get a kiss the odds that number will lead to a date is  or less if you get a passionate kiss with some handholding at the end over  its easy to get a number from a croatian girl but you should resist push for the kiss its similar to what you should do in america 
 absolutely do not add a croatian girl to facebook they are accomplished attention whores and will string you along if you didnt at least get a phone number you got nothing 
 cockblocking is a huge problem the best way to fight it is to be more selective about the venues you choose large clubs have the hottest girls but they are harder to approach and you will end up getting cockblocked incessantly hipster bars have the ugliest girls but youll rarely get cockblocked experiment in the city to find something in the middle that has the best balance between beauty and attitude so much of a successful croatian experience will be based on the venue going from the best venue to the worst you may even feel like youre in a different country as a general rule if youre in a club where the girls arent genuinely excited youre a foreigner you should go somewhere else 
 since so many girls go out in pairs its better to roll with a wingman than solo dolo a problem youll face if you re going out solo is that a girl doesnt want to leave her friend alone what i did was approach girls whose friend was already getting hit on by another guy 
 dont compliment at night  croatian girls already have an elevated perception of themselves and get compliments all the time they are not insecure as girls from the baltics or ukraine  
 dont call a girl before you bang her they rarely answer text instead 
 croatia is slowly embracing onenight stands with the right logistics you should be able to get them they are far easier than a place like ukraine the key here is having tight logistics it should be so tight that you can take a walk with her and be at your place to hop in for a quick drink the girls who are most likely to go for this will be  and who want a taste of the american sexual culture older women will be able to resist your logistical game 
 similar to the above point all your dates should be close to your apartment if your date venue is more than half a mile away youre already shooting yourself in the foot even if a croatian girl is playing aloof she can turn on a dime once in a private room 
 the less snobby the club the more acceptable it is to buy a girl a drink without getting punished for it croatia isnt like other eastern european countries where girls are generally upfront and honest with their intentionsthey will play you if you give them the opportunity especially the higher end venues generally speaking as long as she didnt have a bitch face when you first approached her you should be in the clear to buy a drink  
 the best game for zagreb the capital is to have the best logistics possible sadly croatian girls flake more than average so you want the proximity of your apartment to act as bait for casual hangouts that turn into bangs unless youre dealing with an older croatian girl who is into you youll have to play the numbers game and not get hung up on any one girl get ready to meet some hardcore female players 
 if you put x hours a day into day game and x hours into night game youll be rewarded with night game first you can get surprisingly fast bangs at night that day game doesnt provide mostly because aggressive night game easily screens out day girls who are simply bored but not really hankering for dick if i go back to croatia ill just move right next to a good bar",2016-10-26
1204,nintendo cuts fullyear sales operating profit forecasts,"by day i work in a scrap yard it is not glamorous but glamour does not pay my bills in the evening i teach in a welding program at a community college
like many others i once bought into the fallacy that you need a piece of paper from a university to succeed in life at the age of thirty i graduated from a university with an undergraduate degree and the customary debt which came along with it twentynine years later i see how wrong i was
soon after graduating i obtained an office job and moved to a city where i knew no one the job i was so optimistic about turned out to be like marriage to a crack whore each day was as if walking through a minefield full of dysfunctional women emasculated men drama backstabbing catfights and every other problem associated with modern workplaces worse yet the cut male managers allowed trim to be in charge resulting in a fucked up toxic culture after three tumultuous and abusive years i found myself unceremoniously kicked to the curb and surprisingly relieved
after a lengthy stint of unemployment i landed an entrylevel job in a metal fabrication company one of the benefits offered was tuition reimbursement for work related classes i enrolled in welding classes at night and upgraded my skills all on my employers dime
i immediately noticed a difference from my previous job i worked exclusively with men except for a few token assholes the men liked their solitude did their jobs and left each other alone the work was varied creative and with overtime the pay was decent the fact that i had a work ethic showed up every day on time and desired to learn earned me respect quickly
i eventually went down a different path but returned to welding parttime as an adjunct instructor
welding is the joining of two metal pieces or parts by applying heat a filler metal or electrode helps to make the joint power source supplies electricity required for heat and a shielding gas or fluxcovered electrode aids in the welding process
the most common welding processes are gas metal arc welding gmaw flux core arc welding fcaw gas tungsten arc welding gtaw and shielded metal arc welding smaw of these gas metal arc welding is the easiest to learn and offers the fastest production welding involves both ferrous steel and nonferrous metals aluminum stainless steel
why welding  according to a bureau of labor report the need for welders will grow by  percent by 
 according to a national association of manufacturers report nearly  percent of manufacturers in the united states report that they cannot find skilled welders to meet demand
 the american welding society reports that the average age for a welder is now in the midfifties
 entrylevel wages in my region average  annually with skilled welders earning  and more after five years in the trade
i frequently hear from employers who are desperate for skilled welders one plant manager told me there are too many computer jockeys and not enough people who can weld and turn a wrench another manufacturer told me we have over a dozen welders retiring and no one to replace them further the school i teach at has more jobs available than they have students enrolled
what welders do welders work in manufacturing construction maintenance repair facilities and service companies welders typically work eighthour shifts and a fiveday week but overtime is common welders often perform other duties like operating metal fabrication equipment and doing assembly work
the more skills a welder develops the more value and earning potential he has for example being able to weld cut and fit up metals and read weld symbols and prints will command a higher wage becoming certified in certain weld procedures also increases a welders wages and marketability
qualifications 
welding is the quintessential bluecollar job it is physically demanding hot dirty and requires a high degree of skill other personal characteristics are good eyesight and hand eye coordination good manual dexterity and good concentration
training community colleges offer affordable training for entrylevel jobs in welding most programs are nine months but my school also offers a sixteenweek work ready certificate in welding students learn common welding processes thermal cutting processes and blueprint reading unlike the typical ivory palace college professors instructors are required to have a minimum of three years related and verifiable industrial experience job placement is also good
additional facts 
despite a decent paying skill in high demand clueless parents and educators continue to dissuade young men from entering bluecollar trades like welding the result has been an entire generation of young men ruined by hostile fouryear colleges worthless degrees and insurmountable debt
perhaps you are a perceptive and bright young rok reader considering a career change in closing consider these facts
 you will always have employment as a welder
 welding skills are highly transferable you can carry these skills to your next and often higher paying job
 unlike many whitecollar corporate jobs of today the average welders wages increase with skill overtime merit increases and production bonuses are common benefits for welders
 at the end of your shift you can leave your job at the door
 welding offers a level of creativity solitude and seeing the fruits of your labor studies show that welders machinists and other bluecollar trades have lower suicide rates than many whitecollar professions
 welding is often a gateway trade into other even higher paying trades like machinist multicraft machinery maintenance and millwright
 welding is a male dominated occupation traditionalist men will find it offers some insulation and respite from the typical feminist diatribe and pc bullshit of todays corporate world
conclusion how has welding benefited me first i developed reasoning skills something that academia failed to do i also developed a thorough understanding of how men do the dirty nasty and dangerous jobs in this life feminists and elitists can marginalize men all they want but men risk their lives and health to build and maintain their shit
further welding has opened some doors for me mainly teaching my ultimate goal is to teach welding fulltime a late life career change if you will and one i hope will happen

1205,no title,"the importance of patriarchal religion to marriage and childrearing the importance of patriarchal religion to marriage and childrearing brutus centinel 
brutus centinel is an american christian patriarch leading a family resistance to the decline because guns are libertys teeth brutus is a firearms enthusiast and a militia officer brutus fights to help americans across the political spectrum wake up to the tyranny of our corporate overloads november   religion 
i live in america and i am happily married with kids i do not write this because i am more manly or intelligent or successful than you i am not i write this to share the main key to my success patriarchal traditional religion 
i am writing from my own religious convictions which i believe are true you are free to disagree but you may still find value here i have read the writings of other religions and consider them true myths useful for their wisdom even though i may disagree with their theology neomasculinity itself is a philosophy that can be accepted by people of different religions or no religion modern religion ill find another church thanks 
modern religion is a feminized wasteland god exists to impose obligations on men and excuses womens evil acts faith is blind irrational and collectivist 
men hate modern religion which is why most churches in the west are demographically imbalanced toward women men are bored to death with touchyfeely sermons endless committee meetings female gossip and the losers sitting in the pews around them this is not how it should be patriarchal religion thats more like it 
patriarchal religion is interesting to men it teaches that god is a man creator of rationality slayer of evil men protector of the innocent praise be to the lord my rock who trains my hands for war my fingers for battle psalm  
in maleled churches women are taught to be respectful to their fathers husbands and legitimate authority they understand that their role is to raise and care for children and support their husbands mission wives submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the lord ephesians  
in patriarchal religion female sins like rebellion envy dishonesty hypergamy dressing and acting like a whore and hamstering or rationalizing sin are condemned when the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye and also desirable for gaining wisdom she took some and ate it genesis  i also want the women to dress modestly with decency and propriety adorning themselves not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes but with good deeds appropriate for women who profess to worship god  timothy  and adam was not the one deceived it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner  timothy  this is the way of an adulterous woman she eats and wipes her mouth and says ive done nothing wrong proverbs  finding a virtuous woman this is the unicorn i married 
all women are tempted towards sins like envy but not all women act on their impulses in spite of what many observe in the west i have met many virtuous women few sexual partners before marriage respectful submissive to their husbands physically fit feminine good mothers most are in the older generations especially before the boomers most are involved in traditional religion there are fewer younger women who are virtuous and every single one that i have met is involved in traditional religion they tend to be more rural from small churches 
traditional religion can be extremely helpful to finding and vetting women it provides a community with certain values that you want in a woman and it provides reliable references for a persons character a woman who spent her younger years out in the world and came back at  be a bornagainvirgin is a red flag but a woman in her early s who teaches sunday school and helps with the potluck dinners is far more likely to be wife material the older women in the church will usually let you know if a woman is a whore patriarchal religion helps control womens sinful tendencies with proper training woman can be virtuous 
traditional religion acts as a curb but not a cure for womens immoral rebellious destructive behavior my wife goes to a womens bible study group where she often receives instruction from older religious women this includes things like telling her to be submissive to me lose weight and be healthy not waste money have cheerful sex on a regular basis and to learn how to get some control over her emotions teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine but to teach what is good then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children to be selfcontrolled and pure to be busy at home to be kind and to be subject to their husbands titus  
one of my wifes friends once corrected her attitude toward sex saying you need to view your body as a sheath for your husbands sword she now routinely thanks me after we have sex i am not a natural alpha but i have little fear that my wife is going to suddenly cut off sex if i have a minor slip up band of brothers weve got your back bro deus vult 
with this great power comes great responsibility as a patriarch i am commanded to lead my family instructing my wife and kids on how to act properly with genuine love for their wellbeing i must be on top of my game be physically fit and think rationally when my wife is irrational i attend a mens bible study where we talk about leading as men every man in my group owns a gun and we often go shooting together 
we encourage support teach and correct each other i have had sharp intense discussions with my pastor and men in my church about my own character and life decisions things are handled like men discussed in the open with realtalk not rhetorical bullshit and masculine love and concern for each other this has aided me in thinking deeply about my life and correcting bad decisions i have made 
awhile back we helped another man who was on the verge of divorce he was working  hours a week because he would not stand up to his employer and had no energy to lead his family we told him that the marriage counseling he was getting was bullshit talk about your feelings more and that his slavish attitude toward his employer was making his wife lose respect for him the women in our church also talked to his wife about choosing to be respectful and submissive in spite of her rebellious emotions 
he cut back hours at work which enabled him able to be captain of his ship again this along with training his wife received helped her become more respectful now his wife is less of a bitch and they have sex several times a week i doubt this would have happened without patriarchal religion children ive succeeded as a father 
we see that our culture is toxic feminized and immoral men need a place to raise children apart from these toxins and church is a great place to do this my kids go to sunday school classes where they are taught to be respectful to me my wife and legitimate adult authorities we have several families with welldisciplined children that we can trust wont corrupt our kids my wife often takes the kids for playdates so she can socialize with wholesome women which is a great alternative to sitting around on social media all day conclusion patriarchal traditional religion will not change female nature but it can help restrain it this is how past generations maintained civilization i can confidently say that traditional religion is the main reason i can maintain a happy marriage in this cesspool of a culture those who are not religious might consider other institutions that may provide similar support for their marriage and childraising",2016-10-26

my father was a highranking student radical poobah and still thinks castro is the bees knees although this makes me technically a red diaper baby i rejected all that baloney early on these days i write stories  mostly comedy science fiction  as well as maintain a blog mainly about dating advice political commentary and my writing projects november   politics 
by  its predicted the usa will no longer have a white majority which in  was  for this we can thank ted kennedys immigration and nationality act of  which the politicians swore up and down wouldnt change the american ethnic composition in europe due to declining native birth rates and mass immigration  this will eventually come to pass for several other nations later this century all according to the coudenhovekalergi plan  the leftists with their really big hearts  think all this will be wonderful 
globalism and cultural marxism are the driving forces behind population replacement policies but unawareness and apathy are almost as much of a problem  some think that if western civilization will go down the toilet they should just go with the flow and enjoy the ride all the way down the tubes thanks to media propaganda and educational indoctrination they have no idea that their own civilization is worth anything and dont have the slightest concern for their own posterity still theyre pretty naive to believe that things cant turn far worse within their own lifetimes why this is bad for those who need reminding in the future is this going to get better or worse 
if trends continue unabated the founding peoples will lose control over their destiny history shows that when this happens the results are not good pillaging and plundering is a more genteel affair in modern times though not always  but youre still not going to like it will your new rulers say since things have changed so much how about we abolish affirmative action and setasides to show weve transcended race dont count on it more likely theyll double down on these preferential treatment programs and come up with new ones and you will have no chance to block the spoils systems 
thats just the beginning too the  diversification  of cities for the last several decades has been baddetroit need i say moreand riots really are getting out of hand now imagine what it will be like when you have no hope of influencing things like section  housing moving into your neighborhood or if youll get any real police protection 
this is what were facing if the aztlán crowd takes over the southwest the community agitators get in charge of the big cities and together their constituency has an electoral majority controlling the federal government also remember that theyve been told since the s that youre evil oppressors responsible for all their problems parts of flyover country might be able to hold out for a while but nothing short of forming their own country will stop the advance of progress if it were ever to come to secession theyll be surrounded outnumbered and outgunned lets keep things from getting to that point is there any hope refugees have taken on the characteristics of invaders 
ive painted a grim picture but i have to be realistic as for what will happen later things only look worse jean raspails camp of the saints describes a bleak future like that this isnt just the usa on the line but western europe too and perhaps eastern europe and australia in time if we want to keep from disappearing into the endless night the time to act is now 
sometimes with luck sovereignty can be regained for example the spanish reconquista or the nations of the balkans rising after a few centuries under the turkish yoke however the results arent guaranteed some nations may never recover in these examples the dhimmis were subjugated under military occupation but they were not outnumbered in their own lands the founding populations must not allow themselves to be dispossessed in their own countries in the first place 
granted the dark forces of globalism are very powerfuland theyd like us to think theyre invinciblebut they must be stopped they also want you to think theyre smarter than you and know whats good for you  if theyd simply focus on getting richer and cease their social engineering theyd have far less to answer for not only has our political establishment failed us theyre working against the public  it wont be easy but we must reassert control over our destiny do we deserve to be dispossessed brainwashed sjws welcoming their own destruction 
some will even sayoften with haughty condescensionthat if we lose our countries then we deserve this fate ignoring for a moment the sheer snottiness as well as the might makes right argument incongruent with the usual rhetoric of fairness by the prepare to be assimilated resistance is futile crowd lets consider the following facts in the s a communist propaganda campaign was launched in the western world in the s this mutated into cultural marxism and kicked into high gear during the s most people have no idea of the scope of it all or where things like political correctness came from only senior citizens remember what it was like living in a fairly normal country even fewer never grew up exposed to this propaganda in one form or another the rest of us have been indoctrinated from an early age by the mass media and educational establishment the western political tradition lately is about openness and democracy for this reason we dont conduct political change by torches and pitchforks these days we play fair even if our enemies often dont  further political correctness encourages the disadvantaged to have solidarity but vilifies the same in the majority this is one reason why were on the defensive and for now usually losing most people only have a vague idea about the extent of managed democracy and sheer corruption those against population replacement policies mostly put their faith in the mainstream opposition parties not realizing that theyve sold out to deeppockets globalists too mainstream conservatism is a controlled opposition  providing token resistance at best 
so with that extent of treachery disinformation limited options for resistance and managed democracy its grotesquely dishonest for the defeatists to tell us that were losing a fair fight as for their opinion that we should just give up i have one word no 
whenever you hear the defeatists crowing that this is inevitable or that we deserve it remember that they want to demoralize you and anyone else listening the same goes for when they tell you that loving your people and wanting your posterity to survive is hatred suppose someone is losing his home by a devious swindle orchestrated by crooks widely lauded for their fairness caring and honesty it would be the height of arrogance to tell the defrauded that he deserved it and should shut up about it and let it happen the depopulation and population replacement agenda first the eu has to accept at least a million asylumseekers annually for the foreseeable future the eu should provide  euros  per asylumseeker for each of the first two years to help cover housing healthcare and education costsand to make accepting refugees more appealing to member states 
dont be fooled this isnt happening because some vague invisible force called progress is pushing things inevitably in this direction no its being actively promoted by globalist interests that have adopted cultural marxism as a means of control 
why are native fertility rates declining below replacement level the major factors are women are encouraged to spend their s partying and their s trying to get rich in a cube farm encouraging them to to make starting a family last priority often leaves them very unhappy over the long term and many will miss the chance to begin good economy tends to be positively correlated with higher fertility rates during recessions births go down the implications are obvious if less tax money was taken from working citizens for costly social services programs and spitinyoureye wars then theyd be able to afford more children sending the guilty to prison instead of bailing them out when they crash the economy might be a good indirect measure too about a third of american babies conceived end up aborted  thanks feminism the same leftists who think this is wonderful will scream bloody murder whenever a savage killer on death row is executed but all thats another matter 
because of declining fertility rates the globalists tell us that we must open the floodgates of third world immigration to prop up the population and support the aging citizens so theyve fed us poison and to soothe the symptoms they want to feed us another kind of poison to hell with that 
granted keeping social security going in the usa will be a challenge still its pretty uncertain that newlyarriving immigrantsif they become the majoritywill be able or willing to support millions of elderly gringos as for future european retirees will they be well cared for by refugees from africa and the middle east the way things are now many of them prefer rioting  looting and collecting welfare over working so these are going to be the people propping up the european retirement programs 
dispossession is inevitable only if we let it happen for now we must educate the rest of the public about whats going on and convince them that their future is worth saving and their posterity is worth preserving once weve achieved critical mass we can confront the political establishment and get the government to start working for us rather than against us whats in it for us whenever someone writes that western civilization is nothing but injustice and oppression theyre using technology we invented to complain about us 
its fashionableespecially in academiato bash western civilization were not perfect but nobody else is either the truth is that were a creative dynamic and industrious people some of us are under the impression that we dont have any culture only other people do but thats mistaken i could spend all day listing our major artists composers poets philosophers writers theologians and the like but i only would scratch the surface 
other cultures have made notable contributionsparticularly east asia and the middle eastbut the fact is that the majority of science and technology that makes life comfortable today originated in the western world electricity motorized transportation refrigeration telecommunications computers need i go on yep that was us we shared our medical advances with the rest of the world increasing longevity and quality of life around the globe whether the worlds future looks more like star trek or more like blade runner may have a lot to do with whether or not our people survive 
finally most of us are going to live out our lives in our native countries do we want them to stay the same nations we grew up in some time in the future todays youth will be running the show while were elderly what kind of a place do we want it to be by then western civilization is great lets keep it going",2016-10-26
1207,eu states agree caps on wholesale roaming charges,"as the election is inching slowly towards its end experts are nervously scrambling to find any dirt that would stop the trump train
first megyn kelly pulled the sexist card then it was his undisclosed tax returns then his comments on john mccain then making fun of crippled reporters then his reading of mein kampf then his remarks about dating his daughter
then accusations of racism from former employees his usage of eminent domain hiring of immigrants and other questionable practices the trump university scandal his blunder on abortion old comments on drug decriminalization and gun control his relationship with the clintons and the dc insiders his comments on refugees and illegal immigrants the khan incident and of course the pussygrabbing scandal

surely this time it will sink his campaign wont it  and yet each time teflon don deflects dirt more dexterously than ghetto trash trying escape alimony payments nothing seems to be able to stop him not that his opponents will ever stop trying
trump has the fantastic ability to escape unharmed from what would clearly destroy any career politician howard deans yeehaw was enough to end his bid for the democratic candidate in  and yet trump can call for an end to muslim refugees be accused of grabbing women by their loins and end up being praised for it by the masses while the mainstream media spew their bile 

what has allowed trump to maneuver so nimbly against these accusations is the unprecedented role of internet media in elections including being able to reach people directly through twitter and a lack of trust in traditional media as well as his biggerthanlife persona letting him get away with what others would be lynched for
but thats the story for another article i would rather talk about something else particularly is there anything that could stop him the answer will surprise you as it goes against all conventional wisdom
yes but its not what you think
trumps weak spot 
one of the biggest problems with defeating trump is that unlike other politicians political scandals not only seem to not affect him but they even aid him there is a saying that every antitrump meme is also a protrump meme

trump has mastered political antifragility which causes him to only strengthen when opponents try to destroy him trump has defeated the lefts no platform for fascists mentality by saying things so outrageous they have no option but to report on him
so the left cannot choose to not cover him and let him wallow in obscurity like they did with ron paul neither can they attack him for each of their attacks only make him more popular

one memorable movie quote i remember went something like this every man has a weak spot first you try to buy him with money then women then you go for his family and if that doesnt work well a bullet always does the job unfortunately unlike other political losers don does not need other peoples money nor does he lack female attention and his family is smart and probably safe from violence
but this isnt an article about god forbid donald trump getting assassinated that would stop trump but not the trump train trump is more than a man trump is an idea he is the avatar of discontent of all those opposed to progressive ideology he would become a martyr thus raising the hatred for his opponents to a fever pitch which might alter americas consciousness forever trumps enemies cant afford that
so if ignoring trump does not work throwing dirt at him does not work bribing him doesnt work and even killing him wont work than what is left the answer might surprise you
you see trumps power comes from his contrarianism he is not a candidate he is an anticandidate people dont just vote for trump they vote against hillary obama progressives and cuckservatives he is the wrecking ball who the injured working class and all nonliberal whites as well as minorities not completely in love in with progressive marxist ideology want to use against the establishment
so what can be done to stop him  
well lets ask ourselves what makes trump popular  his brashness his antipc attitudes his antielitism his not being a part of the establishment hacks his being not one of them his being different
so if that is what gives trump strength it would make sense that to weaken him you would have to present him as the opposite of that to present him as being nothing special to make him look boring and weak to present him as just another pcdrone
theyve claimed nonstop that trump is the next hitler and that he will start building concentration camps and sexually assaulting random women by grabbing their cock pockets and will obliterate muslims and minorities with right wing death squad robots

instead they could have claimed that he is just weakling trying to act tough and that he wont deliver anything that he is in love with political correctness and respects women that he is a progressives best choice that he will bring four more years of obama
that of course would present its own difficulties in the age of online media the monopoly of physical press has been broken when news circulates at the speed of minutes rather than hours and days it would be very hard for the establishment media to accomplish this it is very hard to call trump ordinary and boring when his statements break so many taboos
yet as difficult as it may have been at the very least it would have had a chance of success as small as it was calling him sexist racist and other mean words did nothing to stop him and instead only made him more popular with the masses some of these incidents have made donald seem human and it made people trust him more showing his flaws had the opposite effect as intended as those who hated him already needed no extra ammo but those who liked him were either left indifferent or whats worse excited by his statements

at worst a few moderates had doubts set in their mind however considering what short attention span undecided voters have his stellar performance at the second debate clearly made them forget about the statement and maybe even convinced them to focus on bills sexual misdeeds instead
why havent his opponents used this against him 
this brings us to the final point of this article why havent his opponents used this against him have they not the brains to figure this out hard to believe considering the amount of money being poured into think tanks
no the truth is like that the strategy was forsaken because of the sideeffects it would have on their own camp should his opponents try to attack him as another pc drone they would be also attacking themselves just like hillary trying to paint trump as sex offender only made it easier for trump to point at bills sexual indiscretions as it has been said in the mighty book of kek  thee that dwell in glass lodgings shall not propel sedimentary formations the prophecy of kek chapter   verse  

attacking trump for being multicultural politically correct weak inefficient or a shill would only shed light on the establishments own weakness
this means that in order to draw voters away from trump they would have to claim trump loves multiculturalism antiracism open borders free trade globalism and offer another candidate who would be even more extreme than him on these crucial issues

using this strategy against trump even if it was successful would be a pyrrhic victory for his opponents as cuckservatives would have to acknowledge they cant woo supporters with talks about reducing taxes and bringing back reaganism the truth is the future is bleak for reaganbushcuck wing of the gop even if they were to win the election they would lose the war

the left has won the cultural war not just by winning elections but by cultural metawarfare instead of moderating their message in attempt to win election they used popular culture and mass media to push liberal values to the masses and so the right wing had no option but do concessions dropping people who opposed civil rights womens liberation and closed borders
to put it simply the battle was lost even before trump cametrump was the match that ignited the powder keg he simply mobilized people and said what others kept in private but always wanted to say and now there is no turning back
the elites cannot choose to ignore popular will and still win elections anymore they will have to reform the gop to account for their constituencys desire or risk ending in the dust bin of history there is no longer the option to charm the sheeple with talks about low taxes open borders and the awfulness of bigotry they will have to at least nominally give something back to the people to stay in power
as one wise commenter on this site once said  trump may be a liar like the rest of them but at least he is saying the right lies
the next thing people on the manosphere and the altright will have to look after will be trumplike figures who will copy trumps rhetoric but will fail to deliver any solutions or they will try to coopt and redirect that anger but for now for the first time in more than  years we are winning the culture war

1208,no title,"cuckservatism is a topic that has previously been discussed in detail on return of kings  in articles and comments sections alike the underlying reason that this topic is the focus of a great deal of discussion is because its roots are deeply steeped in both cowardice and betrayal
while our readership is well acquainted with the political and social implications of cuckservatism there is also a need to also discuss its behavioral roots to accomplish this task i used my social media accounts to examine connections of mine who displayed all of the classic red flags associated with cuckservatism i then searched for common traits that they possessed based on the nature of their rants or posts
the three characteristics listed below represent key factors which in my opinion are necessary for any individual to transform from an otherwise normal person into a cuck if we can understand these factors this will enable us to develop a more comprehensive strategy for rendering them irrelevant apart from merely ignoring them
political naiveté nothing screams political naivety more than voting for a last minute candidate who considers himself a conservative alternative to trump
this factor represents the first step that one must take to become a cuckservative because it entails believing in a series of premises that are patently false political naiveté can include simpler forms such as believing in the wage gap or that illegal immigrants are natural republicans conversely political naiveté can also be more complex in that an individual afflicted with it might believe in equality as a virtue or that a democratic two party system is the best form of government 
a perfect example of this can be seen in my friends and associates who blindly believe in the constitution these individuals refuse to vote for anyone other than a constitutionalist and their sole metric for judging candidates is the implications of an obscure constitutional issue that only they care about this perspective is indicative of political naiveé because the globalists who run our political system jettisoned any belief in the constitution and rule of law decades ago for them the constitution is merely a convenient rubber stamp used to justify unpopular political decisions 
accordingly anyone who votes only for candidates with such narrow viewpoints is naively playing into the hands of globalists because they fail to understand that the constitution will only function in a nation thats virtuous and willing to abide by its principles 
if the united states continues on its current demographic track we will eventually import a new population that not only despises original american values but would also actively vote to eliminate them the constitution will provide no protections if this occurs because these people will simply ignore it invoking arguably the most important phrase in all of american legal history  
to fail to understand these stakes when considering ones voting patterns instead opting to emulate the local revolutionary war reenactors is a hallmark trait of a cuckservative 
lack of self confidence a cuckservative would never get this far
lack of selfconfidence and the feelings of doubt that serve as its foundation represents a second symptom of cuckservatism which is why return of kings has countless articles on how to acquire and maintain selfconfidence as a form of preventative medicine 
doubts as to ones chances of success coupled with fear and the innate need for selfpreservation can easily shatter most people in such moments of weakness its very easy for a person to do a  and to do something that they would normally find revolting conversely if one steadfastly believes in their convictions and themselves their selfconfidence will become stronger this is true even in situations when seemingly the entire world is against them 
the following clip is from an interview that jeb bush did with lester holt during the republican primary and is an excellent illustration of how a lack of selfconfidence can lead to powerlessness and a lack of control over ones surroundings 

from the very beginning of this clip jebs lack of self confidence is readily apparent whether it was the fact that he was too far hunched over in his seat his attempts to curb his nervousness by forcing himself to smile or laugh or the fact that he rarely made eye contact with lester holt any ability that he has to project himself was undermined by his body language
an even deeper sign of his lack of selfconfidence begins at  in the video when holt proceeds to ask him why he didnt frame the charleston shooting as an act of racism in this situation if asked such a question in any setting an individual has one of two choices if he is selfconfident he would turn the question back on lester holt by saying that racism is a social construct and the only people who care about it are limpwristed losers
however if one is like jeb and lacks selfconfidence their response to this situation will be to immediately try to compromise by acknowledging the premise raised by someone like lester holt and then spend the rest of the interview trying to show that theyre not a bad person this was the approach that jeb used and it demonstrated to lester holt that he was weak which then led to lester forcing jeb to backtrack and question his own decision to support stand your ground laws during his tenure as floridas governor
a lack of selfconfidence as evidenced by jebs failure to retain control over his surroundings during his interview with lester holt highlights a classic character trait shared by cuckservatives the only answer that i can come up with as to why this trait is so prevalent is that it might be a product of their childhood that they havent been able to get over
in a way the archetypal cuck was likely bullied or mistreated as a child but has never learned how to fight back or to love being hated by others because of this they never developed the necessary level of selfconfidence to succeed in life which eventually translates over to their politics
they want to be friends with everyone how to destroy a political movement established by ones father in one fell swoop
having grown up in the leftist northeast and considering that i still live and work there im used to being in the political minority my coping mechanisms for this situation consisted of unknowingly embracing key tenets of the alternative right and knowing how to pick my political fights additionally i also resolved to never be friendly with or ever trust anyone from the political left a decision that has been vindicated over the last several years 
unfortunately my approach is not a popular one amongst political dissidents in my region this is because many of them having grown up with leftists simply view their political disagreements as a series of gentlemanly differences that they can put aside over a few beers they refuse to believe that leftists and sjws hate anyone who even slightly disagrees with them and like women view weak men as easy targets 
accordingly when faced with the choice of staying true to their beliefs or moderating them in order to ensure that they get invited to the next sushi night art showing or paint nite the cuckservatives that i know will roll over every time specifically theyll profess support for third party libertarian or constitutional candidates while supporting a slightly lessliberal version of their leftist friends politics 
this tendency demonstrates a key principle that most cuckservatives subconsciously hold they want to be liked by everyone and will therefore do anything they can to make this happen even if it means betraying themselves and their own beliefs in the process when does adopting this attitude ever lead to success in life 
if a child keeps getting beat up by a schoolyard bully should they cower in the bullys presence and act as his lackey in order to avoid getting hurt we all know that such an approach is worthless and that the only way to respond is to fight back yet these people adopt the same approach when dealing with the political equivalent of a schoolyard bully perhaps their reason for trying to be friends with globalists and trying to appease them by being moderate stems from the way in which they handled problems in childhood however that issue itself is another topic that deserves discussion by itself 
is there a remedy for these character flaws even if we understand these characteristics and can think of active ways to subvert cuckservatism we will not be entirely successful most people who fall under this category have been psychologically conditioned to act this way meaning that much of our attempts to open their eyes will fall on deaf ears i have no sympathy for these people because theyve never had the internal drive or fortitude necessary to overcome adversity and would rather wallow in misery while also pulling others into the abyss with them 
however there are always a couple that might show potential these individuals might only be seen by us as cuckservatives because they imitated others around them while lacking a positive role model that could show them the truth the greatest service we can do for these select few is to identify them and prove that there is a viable alternative 
if  cents a day can supposedly help a starving african family have rice for six months then us acting as positive role models to our weaker brethren will help them immeasurably while also advancing our own cause

1210,no title,"american woman in bikini desecrates french catacombs for her female indiana jones brand american woman in bikini desecrates french catacombs for her female indiana jones brand 
andré is a young european who left his decaying country in  for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november   girls 
the paris catacombs are a place dear to my heart born in this very city i had a front row seat to see it turn into a giant museum every wealthy asshole wanting his own piece of the city of lights and paris being one of the most visited cities in the world  i could see year after year the streets taken over by luxury clothing shops and expensive venues the middle and lower classes have been pushed aside by rising living costs so that the rich globalists the bobos and a neverending trail of tourists could stroll around 
yet go twenty meters below the haussmanian hurdle and you will find something very different 
south of the seine the lands have been deeply dug to extract building stones most of the voids have been filled since but more than a hundred kilometres of mine galleries are still there exploring the place is officially forbidden which is a good thing as one can go there officiously provided one knows how to enter and not get lost in the labyrinth without bothering with swarms of tourists or wasting money in an overpriced bar 
officially prohibited actually more or less selfmanaged by a loose community of cataphiles  the catacombs are one of the most interesting places today in paris it allows for genuine explorations and friendly meetings while also teaching some masculine virtues to those who venture there seriously 
the underground network being fragile and the officials not enjoying when too many visitors tread on their jurisdiction the cataphiles have a complex relationship with exposing it on the one hand we like to show the place and share its atmosphere with passionate newcomers on the other we are afraid that too much exposition will attract too many visitors and stifle the officials relative toleration for unofficial activities 
well today other cataphiles wont chastise me for mentioning the topic in public for this has been already made recently by an attention whore of international scope alison teal a hawaiian  or  years old girl made a show of herself down there and sent ludicrous photos to the daily mail  so im here to teach you about protecting the planet yknow i love bringing surfboards in places without waves by the way im the feminine indiana jones especially with the help of a crew ill never give credit to follow me on instagram and yt 
here we are not talking about attention whoring lightly the daily mail photos already tell much a blond girl in a pink bikini carries a pink surfboard in a narrow underground network where there is by definition no waves to surf at all to take some photos of herself herself herself and a bit of the catacombs as they could be used as the setting of the latest of alisons adventures im not joking these adventures are literally hitler a trademark 
since she was at least  teal seems to have taken advantage from the nomadic lifestyle of her parents to make photos movies and promote herself heavily along the way with the help of her dad a wellconnected photographer and selfpromoter who claims to master yoga she got a bunch of awards and media promotion longhaired alison was thus handed a niche that allows her to travel the world take pictures of herself in various places and claim to be concerned about the environment 
her résumé shows a massive ego associated to minor lies the world was my school and playgroundi guess smaller places would be too small for her giant ego and this may explain why she suffered from claustrophobia under paris as we are to see below between namedroppings references to media awards and other big pictures of alison teal and alison teal we learn she was styled the female indiana jones by time magazine  and the oprah of adventure by the huffington post  really 
actually teal said to the huffpo she aspired to be the oprah of adventure in  before branding herself as the female indiana jones to the time a year later  not  then she said on twitter and on her résumé how they had referred to her as such not a big lie but a lie indeed by the way she also branded herself a tarzan child in the huffpo interview would someone who really grew up in the wild be so obsessed with linking herself to famous icons excerpt from the huffpo article  the same articles adds she is a selfdescribed tarzan child excerpt from the time article  named by time magazine or selfstyled and now on her résumé not only does she lie by misattributing to famous media outlets selfcharacterizing and lavishly flattering labels but she cant even put the right years while referring to said media pieces 
so selfstyled female indiana jones no less went through what seems to be a joint undertaking with the daily mail by descending into the paris catacombs with the symbols of her adventures namely a pink bikini and a surfboard the english tabloid released the photos video and testimony of indianajonesinabikinisurfingthecatacombs the  th of october days after a bunch of french outlets copied the mail content often translating it verbatim  
what struck me first are the stunning inaccuracies the tabloid published first the mail claims teal went  meters below the ground whereas the actual depth of the catacombs goes between  and  meters depending on where you are in the network cant indiana jane tell the difference between  and  meters 
second she also claimed to have lacked oxygen and witnessed the water level suddenly rising this is at best extremely unlikely the water levels can change from month to month and even from week to week but to my knowledge it never changes abruptly in seconds as for the oxygen issue i have witnessed some only two times at a big party when so many people were in the same room that there was not enough oxygen to light a cigarette and from claustrophobic newcomers who could not stand the place 
either she completely made up the sudden water change and oxygen issues in order to give her story a sensational aspect or more likely got a panic attack due to claustrophobia but preferred to twist it into a grandiose plot rather than acknowledging her own limitations the mail just ate that up and published without question they did not ask any actual cataphile for sure had they done so anyone with a decent experience of the catacombes could have told them what i just wrote above 
i also noticed from her quotes that she does not mention anyone from her crew gives no credit to the men who opened the manhole cover helped her go down the humid ladder showed her the way filmed her she would never have found the entrance if no one already in the know had accepted to be her guide neither could she lift manhole covers of more than a hundred kilograms with her thin armseven the round butt she likes to display couldnt do that the first photo displayed by the mail notice how she strategically displays some of her butt 
i could bet she did not have sex with any of the guys who enabled her display to happen as julius evola hinted she is likely the kind of woman to whom the possibilities of physical love are often not as interesting as the narcissistic cult of her body or as being seen with as many or as few clothes as possible evola revolt against the modern world  chap 
in this respect the only thing that makes teal special compared to all other lookatme twats is the adventurous label she tries to put on herself exploiting people and places to garner attention is definitely not special yet a lot of comments have noticed this behind the weird mix of glamour and pseudoadventure some are offended that she treaded on bones ie remnants of real past men in a pink bikini doing so is not only a proof of bad taste and selfaggrandizing maniait is also utterly disrespectful 
this is indeed a blatant example of pussy pass  imagine going to hawaii bringing a skateboard at a local cemetery and start skateboarding over the graves in a pink throng what do you expect would happen you would probably get beaten by locals and if the media gave you attention at all they would label you as a disturbed troll or something like that all this i think would be fair but when a selfimportant oprah jane of superadventure does the same the mainstream media reacts completely differently and celebrates her without the least hint of criticism 
though she treading and surfing on bones of actual past people is not very respectful for sure i think especially appalling the outlook teal seems to carry on the place the catacombs are just another background for alison adventures whole places some loaded with historical and spiritual significance are reduced to a set for the egotic show of another vapid character the entire world was her school or so she said meaning that the world is turned into a mixture of disneyland and hollywood studio where her picture can stroll around some weeks ago alison teal was busy showing herself near an erupting volcano notice another strategic partdisplay of her butt 
usual newcomers to the catacombs come there with a genuine interest in the place they come to find out sometimes drink and have an actual adventure they cannot help but feel some humility perhaps even awe when meeting with the bones of millions of nameless dead most if not all of them having lived before the nineteenth century and having been carried there so that paris could grow 
this is very different from using the place to play adventure treading on bones in a rather inappropriate outfit depending on a crew of real cataphiles but forgetting to give them the slightest credit and showing utter carelessness to the historical and spiritual significance of the place all so that alisons ego adventures show continues 
as you can see above a lot of the comments are negativeespecially those from cataphiles and teal has discreetly withdrawn the video of her trail from youtube putting it into private mode 
teals circus has at least one merit it symbolizes pretty well one of the worst aspects of the westernization of the world in the west there is no wilderness no sacredness no magic there are tons of potential places for tourism but ultimately all these places are losing their soul and turning into disneylands the catacombs are worth it because they are definitely not so and should never be 
fortunately there can be some immanent justice the wave of criticism under teals disrespectful show is well deserved more harshly a young libtard who thought she could hitchhike through middle east to prove muslims peaceful got raped and killed by the peaceful ones she theatrically claimed to care about the event shew or should have shown that the world is not a giant kindergarten for western strong and independent narcissists 
in a world of selfmarketing and selfcentred cunts everyone is too busy caring about ones image and about meaningless representations to truly care about a place or about family members 
truly respectable women are not the ones we spot the most easily and true cataphiles are often discreet as well your humble servant bathed there before teal pretended to surf the place but i would definitely not exhibit myself treading on bones in a pink thong",2016-10-26

1212,wikileaks email clinton operative thinks black voters are stupid,"a tenperson federal jury has found that rolling stone journalist sabrina rubin erdely defamed university of virginia dean nicole eramo with actual malice over a fraudulent college rape story rolling stone and its parent company wenner media were also found to have defamed eramo who is seeking  million in damages but to a lesser extent than the writer herself rubin erdelys piece conveyed that eramo was indifferent and even callous towards the accuser jackie coakley  in addition to discouraging her from reporting the crime and so continues coverage of the rape hoax of the decade
the controversy which began with the publication of rubin erdelys story in  centered on a now debunked fraternity gang rape alleged by fabulist coakley  well before this weeks court decision rubin erdely admitted to not bothering to contact the male uva students accused of the act these young men via their phi kappa psi fraternity are suing separately for  million  a surprisingly low figure which makes eramos claim look comparatively astronomical
sabrina rubin erdely far left arrives for court pictured on the right is the deputy managing editor of rolling stone sean woods instrumental in the bogus storys publication and who defended it later
because of coakleys limited financial position and the respect even outed sexual assault frauds are given eramo is legally pursuing only rubin erdely rolling stone  and wenner media for the  million nevertheless eramos attempts to portray herself as a victim are troubling she was after all uvas goto college administrator for handling sexual violence cases a euphemism for the organizer of what are basically kangaroo courts
aside from eramo uva president teresa sullivans actions were appalling giving basic credence to jackies allegations sullivan suspended all greek life activities at the university of virginia as publicity about the accusations grew this only increased the suffering of the falsely maligned fraternity members plus gave ammunition to the rape culture activists who ridiculously represent every young male on campus as a potential sexual abuser of women
the true victims are the falsely accused young men not nicole eramo nicole eramo is a victim of the same system she helps to prop up and defend rape culture
nicole eramo may have been defamed but she was also intricately involved in a uva system that does not afford young men even the most basic procedural rights whilst we should be happy that she did not rush into supporting jackie coakleys lies to the extent of trying to eschew police involvement we are still not dealing with either an admirable or upstanding individual
after extensive research i am yet to find instances of eramo challenging the shameful treatment of college students accused of sexual assault whether in specific instances or more broadly she is neither a defender of these young men nor some kind of principled whistleblower the only positive thing that can be generally said of her is that she is somewhat less prone to typical kneejerk sjw reactions ie she did try to get jackie to talk to the police
again jackie coakley has escaped any punishment stupid does not even begin to describe the man who decided to marry rape hoaxer jackie coakley thanks to chuck johnson and wwwgotnewscom for their work in outing coakley as a fabulist and sociopath
jackie coakley is the sociopathic architect of this whole mess notwithstanding that rubin erdely and others would have gleefully found another poster girl from somewhere else in america the degree of malice and calculation in coakleys actions is the worst i have seen even the very terrible crystal mangum  the black stripper who is now serving a long sentence for homicide not false rape allegations made her bogus accusations of racism and being gang raped much more opportunistically after duke lacrosse players declined her services as a stripper coakleys misdeeds however inhabit a world of their own
because women like jackie coakley obsessed as they are with fantasy worlds and selfvictimization have next to no money to go after in defamation suits they need to be charged and prosecuted for crimes such as public mischief it obviously would be better if they were charged with making a false rape claim yet coakley had enough selfpreserving foresight to avoid talking to the police consequently the system usually gives next to no remedies for discouraging outright lies about rape to boot the washington post may have savaged rubin erdely and rolling stone  but it still refuses to publish jackie coakleys full name despite all the evidence completely disproving the rape accusations
if nicole eramo gets  million the accused male uva students deserve  billion attentionseeker emily renda she used jackie coakleys lies to promote an agenda not seek redress for a victim
determination of damages in the nicole eramo case is yet to take place and the  million claim may just have been posturing by her legal team a high watermark figure designed to secure a smaller but nonetheless very tidy sum at a minimum the accused uva students deserve  times more than whatever eramo gets of course wenner medias coffers are nowhere near that big but the principle remains compared to the mauled reputations of the witchhunted fraternity members eramo suffered a slight pinprick from a broken system she has otherwise staked her career on supporting and expanding
other villains in this saga also need to be held to account chief among them is emily renda  a sociology major at uva who is now completing a law degree at uc berkeley a rape culture extremist she acted as the conduit between coakley and rubin erdely as chuck johnson and got news have already demonstrated rendas own rape survivor story has changed  biased journalists such as anna merlan  formerly of jezebel  additionally promoted the uva hoax and were greatly upset when the gang rape was found not to have taken place so many supporting actors created this mess
lets hope that the heavy legal blows against rubin erdely rolling stone  and obliquely jackie coakleys lies continue with the uva fraternity defamation suit only significant financial and legal hardship not the pangs of conscience will stop sjws and their enablers from attempting to ruin the lives of innocent men

1213,britain joins biggest european military buildup since cold war,"many older physical trainers and even those younger ones who were proteges of the older men will tell the trainee that there is an inverse correlation between strength and speedthat being too big and muscular will slow down an athlete for whatever reason i have found that this is most prevalent amongst traditional martial artists the usual reason given is that the increased mass is simply a dead weight while those with a little bit more knowledge will explain that lifting will develop slow twitch muscles over the fast twitch muscles needed for sprinting jumping punching and kicking
i am here to tell you that the common wisdom is completely wrongwhen done properly weightlifting will not impede your speed and will in fact enhance your speed and explosiveness
anecdotes perhaps youve heard of this man

that is of course jamaicas usain bolt the fastest man in the world and holder of multiple olympic records also worth noting is that in an interview mr bolt revealed that he squats  pounds and at least partially attributes his nigh inhuman speed to his training regimen and hes not the only speed athlete who this can be said oflook at any olympic class sprinter they are all quite muscular fellows

similarly other athletic disciplines thats athletics in the specific rather than general sense im using the european term for what my countrymen call track and field have claimed to utilize weightlifting in their training such as the long jump and the hurdles or you can take my word for it at my best i had a one rep max squat of  pounds and had a  inch vertical leap i am judging this by my ability to perform a standing jump over ndhighest position hurdles which are measured at  inches 
in fact many worldlevel athletes of all disciplines are utilizing olympic style weightlifting to develop speed and powe r
anyway you slice it compound weight training is a fantastic supplement to all athletes even those who seemingly dont need that raw brute strength
the science as i elaborated in this article  as well as in the free pdf i offer to subscribers to my website the subscription signup is on the front page theres more than one type of way to be athletic more accurately there are three speaking purely in terms of muscular andor nervous system function so this does not include handtoeye coordination or other skills related to team sports these three things can loosely correlate to the three types of muscle fibersredor slowoxidative fast glycolyticor white and fast oxidative rather than rehash an article that ive already written we will focus on the white muscle the fast glycolytic this is the type of muscle you want to be training for if you want to develop sprinting speed or a high vertical leap
or to put this into terms of newtons second law of motion accelerationforcemass ie the amount of muscular force you can exert divided by your body weighthow fast you can accelerate and yes i am aware that theres probably a more mathematically accurate way of putting this
which exercises to do it is at this point that youre probably asking which exercises you should train to develop those physical skills you desire if you read my articles regularly you will know what i am likely to saycompound free weight lifting
in fact ill go out on a limb and say if you dont know which exercise you should do to develop a certain physical trait you should always default to a compound lift unless you receive some further information that says otherwise training for speed or vertical leap is no exception to this rule
if you are looking for sheer running speed and leaping ability the power lifts that hit the lower body are most effective deep ass to grass squats deadlifts and the clean and jerk are used by professional athletes to great effect

similarly if you want the ability to throw a ball or punch harder upper body compound lifts are the key bench presses overhead presses and yes the clean and jerk will see you through

so for those of you who are afraid that your athletic performance will be somehow impeded by heavy weightlifting nothing could be further from the truth

what i dont get is why are gals bitching this is the world they wanted they clawed and scratched and burned their bras and had court cases and threw fits to get exactly what they have they hated men because they said men werent letting them copulate frantically like men had always wanted them to men or more likely their mothers didnt let them make themselves unattractive by dressing like hodcarriers and swearing like sailors finally men gave in and now women hate them for that  whatever happened to gratitude  
sally sue might have teeth like pearls and brains and perky tits and a wacky sense of humor and actually be quite a prize but sex trumps art if sally didnt say yes she knew that greta would women had commoditized themselves it was a marvelous thing for the testosterone wads we think of as college boys

sooner rather than later all internet roads will lead to the same new world order socialist philosophy
as profiling of internet users becomes more prolific and the algorithms more sophisticated in the coming years the news and information we search for will be tailored to slowly nudge us one way or the other politically one small step at a time
the management of the information we get to read is already in its infancy
why do you think that free app on your phone that only performs a few functions swells in size with each update that is released do you really think they give a damn about your privacy and are plugging security holes hell no the apps we download are moving from useful lowresource using services to resource hogs necessitating an upgrade in processing power every year or two because they only provide us with a free service in order to hook us so the apps can gather information about everything weve ever written on our devices for social engineers and marketing flacks the apps are becoming more sophisticated in the way they monitor everything we do  which is why the apps need all that memory size
and soon apps will be gathering information about everything weve ever said aloud by using the built in microphones on each device and speech recognition technology cia agents confirm microphones can easily be activated even when a device is switched completely off
this type of information will be collected in giant databases such as the utah data center with the ultimate goal being the corporategovernment complex knowing more about us than we know about ourselves
big brother was so yesterday orwells big brother idea never could have imagined the insidious nature of todays information technology
todays information technology has put big brother on steroids
the waking times details this frightful world that is already emerging as anyone who pays attention knows search engines are already tailoring information to what we search for and even what we text people about
mr x weve studied the little virtual bubble you live in and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth
most of the time the information one will see in this internet bubble will be customized to suit a persons interests this is why facebook relentlessly pushes the like a page or product portion of its web site this information is used to build a profile of a person that ultimately will be able to accurately predict the color of their next bowel movement
if a man is interested in nongmo foods advertising and news stories will be tailored to inform him of grocers who sell organics and about news from approved outlets with stories written on the topic most of the time this will be insidious advertising and ads disguised as information
hello audience were going to pitch you on becoming fullfledged obsessed consumers as if there is no other worthy goal in lifeand then were going to profile you from top to bottom to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands
the utah data center is designed to store exabytes of information on all forms of communication including emails cell phone calls and internet searches as well as all types of personal data trailsparking receipts travel itineraries and bookstore purchases
as another example okay we know you are interested in traditional gender roles we  the information managers like facebook and google will now to find news stories and customize the information you get to read online in order to cause you to doubt the validity of your beliefs the ultimate goal is to slowly but steadily move you away from believing in traditional gender roles to believing in militant feminism without you realizing what we have done
this type of information management is even more insidious than outright censorship as it will be designed to steer everyone towards what the controllers of society want us to think and buy no matter how far from the ideal consumer and fellow traveler we may be
think of it as a game of plinko on the price is right in which all chips ultimately fall into the perfect braindead consumer slot at the bottom of the maze the social engineers dream is a world of nothing but sexless consumers who perform mindless work in meaningless jobs whose only outlets for pleasure are shopping and eating out and other stateapproved activities
think thats hyperbole travel around the world for six months to a year then come back to the united states and tell me what you think
little information bubbles merge into big information bubbles we become what we are repeatedly exposed to which is why a war is on for your mind
once we have you believing a certain way or questioning your established beliefs the key comes when it is time to steer public perception one way or the other this is where the rubber meets the road in the realm of managing the populace like so many sheeple
but when a big one comes along like the  national election in the us the separate tunes come together and ring as one then the overriding need to extend globalisms goals in the person of hillary clinton blot out every other priority then the major media twist whatever they need to twist then its the same bubble for everyone
soon just like the mainstream media on television and in print everything you see online will be directed at making you think behave and vote a certain way the micromanagement and control of information just hasnt become that sophisticated  yet
obama already hinted that only official information should be linked up by the corporate interests of facebook google etc look for hillary to implement that idea with an iron fist if she is whisked into the oval office  an internet security crisis will likely be engineered in the near future in whichyou guessed itbig daddy government needs to step in and take control of the web from there on out we will be back to corporategovernment propaganda instead of the libertarians dream the current iteration of the internet is
so the awakening we have seen from the brainwashing of the corporate media will be a temporary one if the elite have anything to do with it the groundwork of this new socialist system of micromanaging information is already being laid you already see it every time you do a search
someday soon the only information well be able to find online will be from sources the corporategovernment complex approves of of course there will be renegades and rebels like us who resist but most of the braindead sheeple out there will go along to get along just as has been happening since time immemorial
our options will be to get off the grid or to move to a new internet neither move will be peacefully tolerated by the powers that be

happiness its what we all want as human beings no matter the differences in where we seek them we are motivated to do things to be happy and we avoid things that may detract from it even those who claim that they dont care about happiness or that theyre living for a higher purpose is doing what they do because it makes them happy in that way happiness is beyond a state of feeling it is a state of being 
now although you dont want to be obsessive about happiness and make your life revolve around attaining it there are few things you can do to live a more fulfilling life and improve the quality of your being and as its often the case with selfimprovement i believe that addressing the bad habits will lead to a healthier life than trying to gain the positives 
here are some ways you may be sabotaging your own happiness  you are chasing it ill be happy once i finally 
the more you chase happiness the less you have of it and not only are people today chasing happiness theyre chasing all the wrong things in hopes that it will bring them everlasting joy money women and status may elevate your life but they cant be the source of happiness alone they will especially fail as being compensation for some void in your life that youre trying to fill 
also know that your mood will naturally fluctuate over time constantly obsessing over how you feel and getting stressed over your emotional state will not help you so rather than jumping from one thing to another in hopes that it will boost your mood or dull your pain focus on things that matter to you its far better to work on selfimprovement and enhancing the overall quality of your life than be wavered by feelings  you dont have the basics taken care of good sleep is extremely underrated in our busy society it affects your mood testosterone level mental capacity and more prioritize sleep as much as you do with healthy diet and working out 
its often the basics that are overlooked ask yourself are you sleeping well its harder to tell than you think are you eating healthy are you keeping yourself fit are you getting enough sunlight do you ever take the time to connect with nature do you have a stable life do you have a purpose or a meaning i doubt most people have all of these basic needs checked off but im willing to bet that an improvement in even one area will significantly improve a persons mood and well being  you concern yourself with things you cant control no something bad is happening in the world and i cant do jack shit about it time to complain about it on the internet 
the more you sweat over issues which you can take no practical action over the more helpless you feel and the more unhappy you will be of course being able to tell the difference between what you can control and what you cant is an art in itself that you need to master through experience one thing im personally doing to lower stress is to reduce my news consumption and be less concerned with events around the world that are irrelevant to my personal life ill read enough to get a general awareness of whats happening around the world but i refuse to be emotionally invested in things i have no control over  you lack intimacy and deep human connection if you dont have any friends to be vulnerable with you didnt have any to begin with 
i would argue that this is one of the biggest if not the biggest factor in causing anxiety depression and general unhappiness in the modern world humans are social creatures and we need to bond with others and beyond simply spending time with people to chat and drink deeper connection needs to be made with people the quality matters much more than the quantity 
in todays societyespecially in north americait seems people have all become superficial and afraid of intimacy whether it be for friendship or romance without opening up your true self due to the fear of being rejected or ridiculed all the relationships you have with others will not be genuine and it will not be fulfilling  you are not living in the present reality you may be conscious but are you aware 
if you live in the past or the future you lose touch with the present reality that disconnection will cause longing which can only lead to dissatisfaction and loss of joy 
the lure of nostalgia and daydreaming of a better life or an improved world is actually quite insidious because of how intoxicating it is when your mind drifts to imagining a pleasurable experience or a more exciting life you are tricked into thinking that the longing is happiness itself sort of like how mirages work on the contrary studies have actually shown that you are actually happier and more productive when you focus on what youre doing right now even if the task is boring so stick to the reality and forget about your fantasies either make things happen or accept that youre just wasting your time and energy on wishful thinking  you engage in junk activities im happy im happy im happy 
just as there are junk foods there are junk activities that may feel pleasurable at the time but dissatisfying and even harmful in the longrun 
ask yourself do you really need entertainment ive squandered my youth by immersing myself in long hours of digital entertainment day after day i barely even noticed that i was unhappy the whole time because i was so sedated and what did i even get out of them those were several hours everyday that i could have spent reading working out learning new skills meeting new people and experiencing the world 
the fact is giving up on entertainment has no negative impact on your level of happiness sure you might miss them when theyre suddenly gone but overall as long as you find more valuable things to do your life can only get better when you ditch them learn to enjoy things that give you value rather than seeking enjoyment in things without value conclusion 
unlike what many people today say no one deserves happiness thats something youll have to earn ill go as far as to say that happinessas defined by modern standardsisnt even necessary and hard to come by for certain individuals everyone has their own path towards living life to his unique potential and there is no universal rule that applies to all so while i havent really listed anything specific for the reader to strive towards i hope i laid out some pitfalls that you can avoid in your journey nov   corey savage",2016-10-26

1223,angel messages for november   video,"by wmw_admin on october   sanchez manning  daily mail oct   
the bbc has been accused of acting recklessly after targeting children as young as six with a programme about a schoolboy who takes sexchange drugs 
parents are angry that the show available on the cbbc website features a transgender storyline inappropriate for their children 
and concerned campaigners said it could sow the seeds of confusion in young minds the programme just a girl depicts an yearolds struggle to get hormones that stunt puberty making it easier to have sexchange surgery in the future 
one mother writing on the mumsnet website said her daughter had become worried after seeing the video she said her girl who likes wearing boys clothes and playing football had asked me anxiously if that means she was a boy 
tory mp peter bone said it beggars belief that the bbc is making this programme freely available to children as young as six i entirely share the anger of parents who just want to let children be children 
it is completely inappropriate for such material to be on the cbbc website and i shall be writing to bbc bosses to demand they take it down as soon as possible 
former culture secretary maria miller voiced her concerns over the bbc tackling the subject in an ageappropriate way saying such issues should be raised where children can have support from parents 
and tory mp julian brazier said this programme is very disappointing and inappropriate children are very impressionable and this is going to confuse and worry them 
family campaigner norman wells said it is irresponsible of the bbc to introduce impressionable children as young as six to the idea that they can choose to be something other than their biological sex 
just a girl is the fictional video diary of a child who calls herself amy and dresses as a girl it is hosted on the cbbc website aimed at children aged between six and  
in the halfhour programme amy  played by an actress  reveals she was born a boy called ben but has already started using pubertyhalting drugs 
such hypothalamic blockers provoked a furore two years ago when the mail on sunday revealed an nhs clinic was willing to give them to children as young as nine 
critics cited research claiming that most teenagers confused about their gender never go through with surgery with many realising they are gay the bbc row comes amid growing controversy over gender issues fuelled by a number of highprofile cases in one a christian couple were threatened with having their yearold daughter taken away because they oppose her plans to become a boy 
in another a sevenyearold boy was ordered to be removed from his mothers care as she was raising him as female causing him a great deal of emotional harm 
in just a girl amy says when i was born mum said dad was so pleased that he had a boy to take to the football but mum knew i was different she realised early on that i was born in the wrong body 
she adds my mum supported me when i did a powerpoint presentation to my class about transitioning and that i wasnt going to come to school in boys clothes any more but girls clothes i wasnt ben i was amy 
later amy is shown telling a friend josh  a boy who wants to be recognised as a girl  that she is on hormone blockers saying it took ages to get them after loads of tests and talks at the clinic once they realised i was trans for real i got them she says in another entry amy tells viewers she has developed a crush on a boy called liam but confides liam thinks im just a girl but im not im trans and whats he going to say if he finds out stop being my friend why im still me arent i 
child psychotherapist dr dilys daws said the programme could confuse children she said that while it was natural for youngsters to wonder what it would be like to be the opposite sex the bbc was irresponsible to feature the extreme step of gender change for sixyearolds because they were too young to grapple with such issues 
the programme generated hundreds of comments on mumsnet 
one mother who said her sevenyearold had watched the show asked am i being unreasonable to think this is an inappropriate topic for a young age group 
another replied dont think this is remotely suitable for a sevenyearold to start suggesting that children can be transgender when theyre far too young to actually have a gender is reckless and damaging a small boy who is told that he can become a girl may take this as meaning that sex changes are possible that sometime in the future hell wake up with a girls body 
another user added i dont think hormone therapy should be normalised any more than yearolds drinking or doing recreational drugs should be normalised 
other critics slammed the bbc mr wells director of the family education trust said the more we promote the idea that a boy can be born into a girls body and a girl can be born into a boys body and that drugs and surgery can put things right the more children will become utterly confused respecting and preserving a childs birth sex should be seen as a child protection issue 
but some parents on mumsnet were more positive one wrote i dont believe there is too young for stuff like this the earlier you teach your children that everyone is different and that nobody is normal the better 
dr polly carmichael a clinical psychologist specialising in transgender children said raising awareness of these issues is the best way to challenge stigma and discrimination associated with identity issues programmes like just a girl can contribute to a healthy and informed public discussion 
the bbc said just a girl is about a fictional transgender character trying to make sense of the world deal with bullying and work out how to keep her friends which are universal themes that many children relate to and which has had a positive response from our audience 
cbbc aims to reflect true life providing content that mirrors the lives of as many uk children as possible",2016-11-06
1224,the chronovisor a device used to look into the future and past,"cyrus mistry joins aap tata sons shortlists candidates for chairmans post posted on tweet image via intodayin 
ousted chairman of tata sons cyrus mistry today joined the aam aadmi party speaking to the media cyrus mistry said the media government regulators or politicians no one is supporting me in fighting against the injustice i have faced kejriwalji is my only hope so i joined the aap 
speaking at the occasion aap supremo and delhi cm arvind kejriwal said having worked at tata steel several years ago i have firsthand experience of how the board of directors of tata sons did not allow me to work that is the reason i quit tata steel 
just like cyrus mistry i also took up the top job in delhi because there were no other suitable candidate i empathize with cyrus mistry when he says that ratan tata did not allow him to do work in a similar way narendra modi and najeeb jung do not allow me to do work in delhi he added 
why should someone be fired for choosing to close loss making uk steel business first take care of indians before subsidizing british citizens ratan tata is a british agent even aap does not fire its leaders so fast he declared 
meanwhile our correspondent overheard this discussion between cyrus mistry and rajdeep sardesai 
rajdeep sardesai so what i understand mr mistry is that you are concerned about the rising intolerance by the majority against the minorities in india 
cyrus mistry no i only said that i am concerned about the rising intolerance of the majority shareholders in tata sons against minority shareholders like me 
meanwhile aap leader ashutosh took to twitter to blast tata sons 
as per cyrus mistry tata motors nano plant in gujarat is making losses even industrialists in gujarat are losing money is this the gujarat model will modi answer he tweeted 
cyrus mistry spoke about risk of impairment in tata steal will ratan tata answer read his second tweet 
why was cyrus mistry not given a free hand to run tata suns will the bored answer said his third tweet 
a source who did not wish to be identified told our correspondent that tata sons is also planning to fire cyrus mistry from the board of directors and has already found his replacement 
after ratan tata asked for a versatile candidate with expertise in several fields and who is not afraid to speak his mind a consultant suggested the name of justice katju but ratan tata was not pleased at the prospect of being called an idiot in a board meeting and so vetoed the proposal instead congress leader ahmed patel will be filling this post 
according to our source the tata sons board was very impressed with ahmed patel after he told them that rather than abrupt firing they should have kept planting stories in the media like ratan tata unhappy with cyrus mistrys decision to close down tata steel uk business 
this along with his ability to effectively manage a family trust and also manage a professional ceo without letting him drift from the groups ethos and culture earned him a board seat 
further according to our source several names came up during the latest board meeting to pick a new chairman ahmed patel suggested the name of dr manmohan singh but ratan tata vetoed it saying he wanted a person who could be a brand ambassador for the tata group 
currently there are  persons who are frontrunners in the race for chairman one is arvind kejriwal several board members think that he will be a suitable candidate because he can just give speeches visit offices and be a brand ambassador while the actual work could be left to the board 
another name doing the round is chetan bhagat given his iit iim qualifications along with his versatile persona of being an author columnist screenwriter television personality and motivational speaker several board members think he is the perfect candidate for the heavily diversified salt to software conglomerate further he is good with numbers an area the tata group is struggling at this point in time",2016-11-06
1225,weekly astrology for nov   us election prediction video,"email 
julian assange claims that hillary clintons campaign used hackers to attack wikileaks servers wikileaks editorinchief says that despite the ecuadorian embassy shutting down its internet to stop accusations of interference in us elections his organisation will keep on publishing until the elections are over 
via yournewswire sponsored links 
everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict assange said via telephone at a conference in argentina on wednesday scroll down for video below 
the whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from clintons campaign chair john podesta on a daily basis since early october assange claimed the release whipped up a crazed hornets nest atmosphere in the hillary clinton campaign leading them to attack wikileaks 
they attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the un and british courts to accuse me of being both a russian spy and a pedophile he added 
ecuadors decision to shut down his internet was described by assange as a strategic position so that its policy of nonintervention cant be misinterpreted by actors in the us and even domestically in ecuador he said he was sympathetic with ecuador insisting they face the dilemma of having the us interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the us elections next month more wikileaks has activated contingency plans after assange s internet link was intentionally cut off httpstcooctsmseme 
 rt rt_com october   
assange who claimed the embassy will be without internet until the election is over to avoid accusations of interference said he did not agree with ecuadors decision but did understand it wikileaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from ecuador he said 
he did however reject the idea that wikileaks is interfering with the us election claiming this is not the interference of electoral process this is the definition of electoral process  for media organizations and in fact everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring it cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform 
he also attacked us tv networks many of whom he accused of being controlled by clinton supporters we were fastest on podestaemails  faster than wikileaks  and the us conspiracy machine cant handle it httpstconjaaeqdd 
 rt rt_com october   
the podesta emails will make no difference to the election result according to assange i dont think theres any chance of donald trump winning the election even with the amazing material we are publishing because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with hillary clinton he said 
assange said journalists and people who work in the media are predominantly middle class and view trump as representing what in their mind is white trash",2016-11-06
1226,november message from archangel michael,"its the sort of story that only feeds existing suspicions that the upcoming presidential election is being rigged to install hillary clinton in the white house regardless of the true vote count 
via truthandaction 

it strikes directly at the heart of the integrity of our election process and has the potential to cast doubt on the legitimacy of candidates who are declared the winners the story in question appeared on the infowars website and while some of the details cannot be confirmed its worth a look 


elections in the united states do not have a perfect record of being free from attempts to manipulate the results through fraud as reprehensible as that may be its not entirely unexpected considering whats at stake aggressive efforts to insure the integrity of our elections and the prosecution of those who would corrupt them are essential to giving the winning candidates the legitimacy they deserve
all of this has the potential to go out the window this year as accusations of voter fraud through the manipulation of the counting of the ballots are already rampant
a recent story appearing on the infowars news site claims to show that one tv station is already preparing to announce a clinton victory
a nbc station was caught posting election results showing a hillary clinton victory days before the election fueling concerns that the mainstream media is conditioning the public to accept a rigged election favoring hillary
political activists discovered a hidden web site for wrcb out of chattanooga tenn showing election results with hillary clinton securing  electoral votes and  of the popular vote
the web site originated from the ftp server of worldnow a media software company that provides realtime data  such as election results  and other media assets to local news stations
its important to note that although infowars claims that the site is a hidden site for wrcb we at truth and action could not independently verify this  note that infowars states that this hidden web site is located in chattanooga tennessee a search of the domain name returns ohio as the location where the domain name was registered although that is not conclusive either as to the actual location where the site is maintained
even with these doubts about the authenticity of the web site under discussion this news will do nothing to instill confidence but will be one more factor furthering the suspicion and lack of trust surrounding the integrity of this years presidential election
in fact it dovetails nicely with the fractional method of counting the votes previously reported
election fraud expert bev harris was the first to uncover this method which is also known as vote shaving
you need to have votes counted as fractions harris said on the alex jones show monday you need the votes to be counted with decimal places like you count money
if a vote is a dollar you also need to have cents with it that will not show its hidden
vote shaving works by treating votes as decimals rather than whole numbers which allows the machines to allocate the remaining fractional percentages elsewhere to sway election outcomes
theres this one central computer which at the end of the day all the votes come to it harris pointed out thats where you take it you dont run around to  different precincts you wait until the votes come to you and then you have your way with them
all of this is incredibly troubling one ray of hope is that if there really is a concerted effort to rig the vote for hillary that the trump campaign is vigilant and prepared to take all legal measures to expose any vote fraud and insure that the ballots are counted accurately resulting in a decision that truly does represent the will of the people

1228,get ready for a likely market crash after election video w transcript,"by gordon duff senior editor on october   radio host and trump supporter claims jewish mafia controls us 
editors note the insanity has hit trump mouthpiece and arch zionist alex jones is on the warpath against the jewish mob israels newspapers are shocked as you can see below  or are they trump grandson of a brothel owner son of a slum lord grew up in meyer lanskys mobrun new york and by his s became the ingenuemoney boy of jewish mob kingpin roy cohn it was roy cohn and the jewish mob that built trumps empire and ran interference for him with the gambinos john gotti  company now covering this up seems to be really important but to whom and why 
the article below was published in todays jerusalem post not a word of it is true moreover it is an obvious deflection piece written to save trumps nazi supporters backing in face of vts slam dunk assertions of trumps zionist fanaticism 
after all trump has pushed for war on iran for clearing out the west bank and for a one state solution in israel with palestinians going through the chimneys 
but why then are americas jew haters the human filth that would gas americas jews the big trump lovers some of it comes from the nazi movement itself largely begun as a fundraiser by the adljdlaipacsplc lobby you see no swastikas painted on synagogues no big corporate donations on alex jones by brother nathaniel  a long accused rabid antizionist 
the controversy of alex bullhorn jones being an alleged zionist shill has now expanded to his apparent zionistjewish connections on his  personal staff  website advertisers  link to time warner president edgar bronfman jr 
jones seeming allegiance to zionism which explains why he virtually never targets zionist jews or the racist zionist rogue state of israel when engaging in his notorious rants and attacks  may well stem from a protestantzionist belief system and the widely circulated reports that his wife is a jew  which makes his two children jewish under talmudic law and eligible for the israeli law of return  
with additional information on jones which this site is now providing alex jones zionist connections prompting his reticence to expose global zionism becomes ever more obvious 
trump has played the hate card from day one building his base on hatred of blacksafrican americans messicans and of course he has played the terror card the yellow hordes card and the elite liberal card as well 
that one is aimed at the jews trump whose empire was built by roy cohn and who has been supported and financed by jewish organized crime and now by vegas boss shelly adelson who can buy and sell trump out of his trump change has always been a front for the jewish mob jewish mobsters as oft pointed out by ian greenhalgh have surrounded trump and embarrassed him if you can imagine that more than once 
years ago during nasty litigation radio host jeff rense former partner of alex jones tracked jones and his backing to the jewish mob and the bronfman crime family accused of their complicity in financing  
now we see the zionist press pulling out the antisemite card on alex jones one of israels strongest supporters in the us is this a joke of course this kind of childishness would only work with the brain dead jew hating nazis that have flocked to trump with trumps effusive love of everything israel and everything zionist one might ask why the nazis flock to him but nazis have never been thinkers and are great followers even when they are sent over a cliff like lemmings 
comment boards at vt have been inundated with paid trolls some who track back to israel others employed by trump surrogate operations tied to his campaign toads and trolls get up to  for a comment placed even on wrong articles thus we have closed comments to cut off this income source and clean out the trash were we can even though this is the best money trump pays out except for hookers 
when are american jews going to rise off their knees and hit back at well at israel the adl and the rising tide of naziism in the us paid for by their donations

au vu de la dimension mondiale des problèmes et menaces actuels et de la nécessité délaborer des stratégies collectives pour les combattre efficacement il est essentiel de renforcer la coopération entre lonu et les organisations régionales et sousrégionales dans le domaine du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité
pour ce qui est de lonu il sagit avant tout de tirer parti de son caractère universel aussi bien au niveau de ses membres que de ses activités ainsi que de sa légitimité mondialement reconnue les organisations régionales quant à elles connaissent souvent mieux la situation dans les régions relevant de leur compétence et dans de nombreux cas sont dotées de mécanismes de prévention et de maintien de la paix adaptés aux réalités locales il importe à cet égard que les activités des organisations régionales tendent à trouver des solutions pacifiques et politiques aux conflits émergents
dans ce contexte il est particulièrement important que lonu et ses principaux partenaires régionaux se coordonnent régulièrement sur les questions ayant trait au maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales ainsi le conseil de sécurité tient régulièrement des séances sur la coopération avec lunion africaine lorganisation pour la sécurité et la coopération en europe et lunion européenne ces dernières années un examen a également été mené sur la coopération avec la ligue des états arabes lassociation des nations de lasie du sudest lunion des nations de lamérique du sud et dautres organisations régionales
comme on le sait la collaboration entre lonu et ses partenaires régionaux couvre un nombre toujours plus grand de questions aux activités de maintien et de consolidation de la paix sont venues sajouter la lutte contre la prolifération des armes de destruction massive et le trafic darmes légères et de petit calibre ainsi que la lutte contre le cyberterrorisme et la migration illégale domaines dans lesquels la coopération entre les organisations concernées et lonu est de plus en plus étroite cette coopération joue un rôle essentiel dans le maintien de la paix et de la stabilité à léchelle de leurasie et plus particulièrement en asie centrale
cest précisément dans ce domaine quuvrent trois organisations relativement jeunes dans une vaste zone sétendant de leurope orientale à lextrêmeorient à savoir lorganisation du traité de sécurité collective otsc lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopération et la communauté détats indépendants cei de plus en plus influentes sur la scène politique mondiale ces organisations contribuent considérablement au renforcement de la sécurité régionale et internationale
le débat sera axé sur le rôle de ces trois organisations dans la lutte contre les menaces qui pèsent sur la paix et la sécurité dans la région notamment le terrorisme le trafic de drogues et la criminalité organisée il permettra également à ces organisations de réaffirmer leur volonté de renforcer la coopération sur le plan pratique avec lonu notamment avec son centre régional pour la diplomatie préventive en asie centrale
lotsc est une structure pluridimensionnelle à même de réagir résolument aux divers problèmes et menaces actuels auxquels peuvent faire face ses états membres à cet égard le resserrement de la coopération entre lonu est lotsc dans le domaine du maintien de la paix est prometteur lotsc déploie dimportants efforts pour renforcer ses propres capacités de maintien de la paix qui pourront aussi être mises à la disposition des opérations de maintien de la paix des nations unies elle contribue activement en outre aux actions menées sur le plan international pour reconstruire lafghanistan après le conflit et pour écarter la menace que représentent les stupéfiants provenant de ce pays
ses relations avec lonu se révèlent fructueuses dans de nombreux domaines comme la lutte contre le terrorisme et le trafic de drogues le maintien de la paix ou la lutte contre la criminalité organisée lotsc entretient et développe des rapports productifs avec les entités spécialisées de lonu notamment le comité contre le terrorisme du conseil de sécurité et loffice des nations unies contre la drogue et le crime
tous les deux ans lassemblée générale adopte une résolution sur la coopération entre lonu et lotsc et il est prévu quelle en adopte une à sa soixante et onzième session au titre du point de lordre du jour intitulé  coopération entre lorganisation des nations unies et les organisations régionales ou autres 
les fondements juridiques de la coopération entre lonu et lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopération dans le domaine du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales au titre du chapitre viii de la charte des nations unies ont été posés à la suite de la signature en  de la déclaration conjointe sur la coopération entre les secrétariats des deux organisations actuellement lorganisation de shanghai et lonu collaborent étroitement dans des domaines tels que la prévention et le règlement des conflits la lutte contre le terrorisme linstance régionale de lutte contre le terrorisme relevant de lorganisation de shanghai uvre à cette fin la nonprolifération des armes de destruction massive la lutte contre la criminalité transnationale et le trafic de drogues et la sécurité informatique internationale
dans ce contexte lorganisation de shanghai appuie activement les efforts déployés par la communauté internationale et les organismes des nations unies pour rétablir la paix en afghanistan se prononçant toujours en faveur du maintien du rôle central de coordination de lonu dans le règlement du conflit afghan
quant à la cei la sécurité et la lutte contre les menaces actuelles ont toujours été et demeurent un des domaines prioritaires de coopération entre ses états membres
une coopération constructive avec les organisations internationales est également essentielle pour contrer les menaces émergentes les pays de la cei sont parties à tous les principaux instruments internationaux régissant la coopération dans les domaines de la sécurité du désarmement et de la lutte contre les menaces actuelles et contribuent efficacement à leur mise en uvre

1231,hitler or hillary,"los brics plantan cara a la guerra financiera de estados unidos por ariel noyola rodríguez para hacer frente a la guerra financiera de estados unidos es urgente que los brics fortalezcan sus vínculos de cooperación en los ámbitos de la economía y las finanzas el nuevo banco de desarrollo de los brics debe aumentar su volumen de créditos lo mismo el acuerdo contingente de reservas adicionalmente los brics deben poner en marcha lo más pronto posible su propia agencia de calificación para intensificar su cohesión económica la implementación de un área de libre comercio echaría abajo las barreras arancelarias y con ello incrementaría sustancialmente los intercambios comerciales entre ellos en definitiva si no se toman cuanto antes las medidas pertinentes los brics corren el riesgo de naufragar durante el próximo huracán financiero
red voltaire  ciudad de méxico méxico   de octubre de  français ??????? italiano el  y  de octubre se llevó a cabo en el estado de goa india la octava cumbre de los brics acrónimo de brasil rusia india china y sudáfrica hay que reconocer que el encuentro se desarrolló en medio de una situación profundamente crítica para la economía mundial sin embargo los brics pusieron de manifiesto una vez más su extraordinaria capacidad para transformar un mal momento en una oportunidad para profundizar los vínculos entre ellos desde una perspectiva estratégica
después de que las economías de los brics gozaran de una época dorada en los últimos años sus tasas de crecimiento han sufrido una drástica desaceleración frente a esta difícil coyuntura hoy más que nunca los brics necesitan echar mano de las instituciones financieras que presentaron ante el mundo hace un par de años en fortaleza brasil durante su sexta cumbre   
en abril pasado su nuevo banco de desarrollo realizó sus primeros préstamos    por más de  millones de dólares y para  se calcula que los créditos otorgados podrían alcanzar los   millones de dólares    asimismo esta entidad financiera llevó a cabo en julio de este año una histórica emisión de bonos verdes green bonds en yuanes por un monto equivalente a  millones de dólares    estos títulos financieros a la vez que incrementan la influencia de la moneda china a escala mundial sirven para el financiamiento de grandes proyectos de inversión
por su parte el acuerdo contingente de reservas cra por sus siglas en inglés dotado de   millones de dólares ya está listo para otorgar sus primeras líneas de crédito con el objetivo de estabilizar las balanzas de pagos de los brics según anunció el ministro de finanzas de la india arun jaitley    toda vez que la reserva federal fed de estados unidos amaga permanentemente con subir la tasa de interés de los fondos federales federal funds rate y con ello detonar una nueva turbulencia financiera mundial urge que los brics incrementen cuanto antes los recursos monetarios de su fondo de estabilización pues de lo contrario corren el riesgo de padecer serios estragos por las apuestas especulativas de los grandes bancos de inversiones
de forma simultánea los brics necesitan abrir nuevos frentes de batalla que desafíen de modo abierto la hegemonía de estados unidos y el dólar en el sistema financiero mundial    no solamente a través de los intercambios comerciales en monedas locales sino por ejemplo a través de la acumulación de reservas en yuanes entre sus bancos centrales más todavía luego de que la moneda del pueblo renminbi en chino ingresó oficialmente el pasado º de octubre en los derechos especiales de giro special drawing rights la canasta de divisas de élite creada por el fondo monetario internacional fmi a finales de la década de los    
por añadidura los brics tienen la capacidad de articular una gran alianza financiera con poderosos eslabonamientos geopolíticos entre américa latina asia áfrica y el medio oriente los bancos regionales de desarrollo que están conformados en su mayoría por los países periféricos bien pueden servir a este objetivo el banco asiático de inversiones en infraestructura aiib por sus siglas en inglés el banco del alba alianza bolivariana para los pueblos de nuestra américa e incluso el banco del sur que finalmente arrancará antes de que termine este año
asimismo se ha vuelto una imperiosa exigencia para los brics la puesta en marcha de una agencia de calificación propia que rompa con el predominio aplastante que estados unidos mantiene a través de fitch moodys y standard  poors   
 estas tres agencias de calificación más que realizar evaluaciones que se guíen por criterios de tipo técnico actúan fundamentalmente bajo impulsos de carácter político esto es como auténticas máquinas de guerra degradan las notas de los bonos de deuda soberana y con ello elevan dramáticamente los costos de financiamiento de países como grecia rusia o venezuela
la cohesión económica es otro de los grandes retos si bien es indudable que se ha venido intensificando de forma sustantiva durante los años recientes entre  y  el comercio entre los brics como proporción de sus intercambios totales se duplicó del  al     china es por mucho la economía que está más integrada con los demás brics en contraste los vínculos entre países como la india y sudáfrica son marginales lo mismo sucede entre brasil y rusia por eso es muy pertinente la próxima implementación de un área de libre comercio entre los brics    sin embargo además de echar abajo las barreras arancelarias entre ellos los brics necesitan promover la construcción de cadenas de valor de forma conjunta esto es integrar sus aparatos productivos para incentivar la industrialización de las economías menos aventajadas
en conclusión son muchos los desafíos en el horizonte para estas cinco potencias emergentes estoy convencido de que en lo sucesivo el éxito de los brics dependerá de la capacidad que tengan para reinventarse de su creatividad para articular nuevas dimensiones de cooperación con vistas a cumplir metas de más largo alcance frente a la nueva guerra financiera que prepara estados unidos es momento de que los brics vuelvan a la carga

1234,former us state dept official us intelligence community has started a countercoup against the clintons,"posted on october   by davidswanson 
picture if you will video footage of vintage early  donald trump buffoonery with the ceo of cbs leslie moonves commenting on major medias choice to give trump vastly more air time than other candidates it may not be good for america but its damn good for cbs 
thats the introduction to a powerful critique of the us media a new film screens in new york and los angeles this week called all governments lie truth deception and the spirit of if stone  
the website allgovernmentsliecom has screening dates  a list of lies  and a list of good journalists who expose lies  the lists on the website are not identical to the content of the film but theres a good deal of overlap  enough to give you a sense of what this project is about 
id have made various changes and additions to the film in particular im tired of all the focus on iraq  this film touches on war lies since then but still gives that one particular set of war lies prominence 
still this is a film that should be shown in cities homes and classrooms across the united states it includes and is driven by noam chomskys analysis of how the media system is rigged without those doing the rigging believing theyve done anything at all its a survey of skullduggery by corporate media its an introduction to numerous journalists far superior to the norm and its an introduction to if stone it includes footage of a presentation of the annual izzy award which goes to journalists acting in stones tradition 
one of the lies listed in the film and on the website is that of the gulf of tonkin nonincident anyone paying attention knows of it now as a war lie and it was a transparent war lie at the time in a particular sense that is had the north vietnamese really shot back at a us ship off their coast that would not have been any sort of legal much less moral justification for escalating a war id love it if people could grasp that logic and apply it to the black sea the red sea and every other part of the earth today 
but the gulf of tonkin lies about vietnamese aggression against the us ships innocently patrolling and firing off the coast of vietnam were not transparent to people with faith in the us role of global policeman someone had to make the lies transparent someone had to document that in fact the secretary of socalled defense and the president were lying sadly nobody did that in the first  hours after the congressional committee hearings and that was all it took for congress to hand the president a war 
and it was decades before white house transcripts came out and before the national security agency confessed and additional years before former secretary robert mcnamara did yet those revelations simply confirmed what people paying attention knew and they knew it because of if stone who just weeks after the nonincident published a fourpage edition of his weekly newsletter exclusively about tonkin 
stones analysis is useful in looking at the incident or lack thereof this past month in the red sea off yemen and in fact it is to yemen that stone immediately turned on page  in  the united nations including its us ambassador had recently condemned british attacks on yemen that britain defended as retaliatory president dwight eisenhower had also warned the french against retaliatory attacks on tunisia and president lyndon johnson even at the time of tonkin stone notes was warning greece and turkey not to engage in retaliatory attacks on each other 
stone who tended to look even at written laws that nobody else paid any heed to pointed out that three of them banned these sorts of attacks the league of nations covenant the kelloggbriand pact and the un charter the latter two are still theoretically in place for the us government 
the united states in vietnam stone goes on to show could not have been innocently attacked but itself admitted to having already sunk a number of vietnamese boats and indeed the us ships stone reports were in north vietnamese waters and were there to assist south vietnamese ships that were shelling two north vietnamese islands and in fact those ships had been supplied to south vietnam by the us military and the good old american tax payers 
stone did not have access to closed committee hearings but he hardly needed it he considered the assertions made in speeches by the only two senators who voted against the war and then he looked for any rejoinders by the chairmen of the committees he found their denials to be nondenials and nonsensical it made no sense that the us ships simply happened to be randomly hanging around in the vicinity of the south vietnamese ships stone didnt believe it 
stone also filled in the background information the united states had been supporting guerrilla attacks on north vietnam for years prior to the nonincident and stone raised numerous suspicions including the question of why the us ships had supposedly made sure they were out in international waters for the nonincident to not occur and the question of why in the world vietnam would take on the united states military something nobody could explain though eugene mccarthy proposed that perhaps they had been bored 
missing from the film and website of all governments lie is if stones work on lies about the outbreak of the korean war weve learned more since he wrote it but seen little more insightful relevant or timely for our understanding of korea and the world today this entry was posted in general  bookmark the permalink",2016-11-02

at the time of the recording the media had been asking many questions about clintons affair with flowers and she was worried that the barrage of questions could inevitably lead to inquires into how she landed her job as an administrative assistant for the arkansas appeal tribunal
 
a complaint was being filed by an anonymous woman who felt that flowers relationship with clinton kept her from getting the job when the woman claimed she was more qualified
in the audio clinton is heard coaching flowers on how best to deal with the woman and subsequent questions that may arise
the sections of the audio recordings dealing with the state job were given to the news media in  this came just one day after clinton had appeared on  minutes with his wife hillary  the current democratic presidential nominee  blatantly denying any romantic relationship with flowers
however in his deposition for a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by paula jones clinton would eventually admit to having a sexual interaction with flowers in

in this category trump has raised more than  million thus far based on data from the federal election commission

while mccain and romney had significant income contributions from other sources trumps smalldonor income makes up  percent of his overall funds

1259,comment on nsa whistleblower nsa has all of clintons deleted emails  fbi can access them any time by ronald nelson,"theres a reason david brock founder of the liberal group media matters for america chooses to house an unregistered professional solicitor in his office to raise money for his conglomerate of super pacs and nonprofits
professional solicitors are required to disclose their active solicitation contracts brock wants his unregistered solicitor the bonner group to keep its client list hidden for a very specific reason
david brock is laundering money 
 
related stories consumers need protection from new consumer protection bureau rule heres what the markets are telling us exposed profiteers of governing  and these are the ones who got caught brock has seven nonprofits three super pacs one  committee one llc one joint fundraising committee and one unregistered solicitor crammed into his office in washington 
uncovered records expose a constant flow of money between these organizations
the bonner group his professional solicitor works off a commission every time money gets passed around bonner receives a  percent cut
 
follow the money 
nonprofits are required to disclose to whom they give cash grants
but they arent required to disclose who gives them cash grants
this weak system of oneway verification is being abused by brock hes been cycling money between his organizations for years and the bonner groups  percent commission gets triggered after every pass
 
trending stories frustrated with media bias trump campaign takes its case directly to voters with nightly show on facebook rnc official takes cnn host to task for claiming there is no media bias hannity proposes a sendoff for obama in the event of a trump presidency in  media matters for america raised more than  million
the bonner group was credited for raising these funds media matters paid it a  million commission

that same year media matters gave a  cash grant to brocks franklin education forum  an organization that shares office space with media matters

in  the franklin education forum reported  in total contributions and  percent of that total came from media matters
surprisingly though the franklin education forum gave full credit to bonner for raising that money it paid the fundraiser a  commission in 

notice what happened 
brocks media matters gave a  cash grant to brocks franklin education forum brocks franklin education forum credited the bonner group for raising those funds triggering the  percent commission brock paid the bonner group a  commission to solicit a cash grant  from himself it doesnt stop there 
after the franklin education forum retained  it sent a  cash grant to brocks franklin forum  

note the franklin education forum is a c and the franklin forum is a c they are not the same company 
the franklin forum c paid bonner a commission in   so its safe to assume the fundraiser received a  commission in  unfortunately its hard to tell for sure it still hasnt filed its taxes for 
lets recap 
say for example you donate  to media matters for america this is how david brock would have used your charitable donation in 
media matters would receive your  donation the bonner group would earn a  commission media matters would retain  next media matters would give whats left of your entire donation   to the franklin education forum the bonner group would earn a  commission the franklin education forum would retain  the franklin education forum would then forward the remaining  to the franklin forum the bonner group would earn a  commission the franklin forum would retain  in the end brocks solicitor would have pocketed  almost a third of your initial donation thats a far cry from the advertised  percent commission
as bizarre as that scenario may sound this is exactly what brock did in 
how can we be sure this is intentional 
brock is the chairman for each of these organizations how could he not know whats going on
hes a handson chairman according to their tax returns brock allocates time weekly to his organizations
media matters  hours per week franklin education forum three hours per week the franklin forum one hour per week furthermore the new york times reports that brock shares a summer rental in the hamptons with mary pat bonner the president of the bonner group
brock would have a hard time claiming ignorance on this these transfers are intentional he vacations with his solicitor case closed
still not convinced 
brock didnt even bother to give his organizations different phone numbers they all share the same number

what if  
we even located the bonner groups solicitation agreement with media matters on floridas gift givers guide  clarification on the commission can be found on page 

in english contractually brock has the option to exclude certain contributions from triggering the commission in spite of this option he intentionally chooses to trigger the  percent commission for money grants between his organizations
note yes we are making the assumption that all of brocks organizations have the same solicitation agreement with the bonner group given that his organizations share the same address board members and telephone number we feel its safe to assume they also share the same solicitation agreement 
this barely scratches the surface 
utilizing publicfacing tax returns along with records submitted to the federal election commission we mapped out all the significant money transfers from  that took place in brocks office

summary 
this is all from just one year no further commentary required
we understand this may be hard to believe we first came across this in july and are still having a hard time wrapping our heads around it
all of the data referenced in this article originated from publicly accessible sources check for yourself  we provided links to the source material in our article exposing the organizations operating in brocks office these data have been sitting out in the open gathering dust for years 
if it looks like a duck swims like a duck and quacks like a duck then it probably is a duck
weve spent months trying to find some sort of loophole to justify this activity but there arent any loopholes david brock has something to hide just last month the daily caller reported the following
brocks former longtime livein boyfriend william grey whom brock has thanked in several of his books threatened to go to the irs with damaging information about how brock was running his media matters empire what did brock do he paid grey  to keep quiet brock reportedly had to sell his home in rehoboth delaware to come up with the money this certainly seems to indicate that brock was terrified about what the authorities would uncover
adding to this fox news reported the following
grey accused brock of financial malfeasance and threatened to undermine brocks fundraising efforts
next step is i contact all your donors and the irs grey wrote in an email dated may   this is going to stink for you if you do not resolve this now
we believe that the information presented in this article is what has brock so terrified we feel confident in saying with close to absolute certainty that david brock is laundering money through his media matters conglomerate

1267,russia celebrates a unity day of liberation of moscow from the polish roman papists army in,"after the release of a wikileaks email chain from march  on tuesday in which a top clinton aide admitted president barack obama falsely claimed he did not know about hillary clintons private server use while she was secretary of state white house press secretary josh earnest sprung into action to deny that the president had lied about the issue
what the president said was an entirely factual response earnest said to a group of reporters in los angeles where obama was attending democratic fundraisers
earnest then attempted to explain away all criticism of the presidents actions as mere conspiracies
 
related stories hannity proposes a sendoff for obama in the event of a trump presidency wikileaks podesta said obamas dont need to be this nice to president bush and first lady wikileaks reveals obama knew about clintons emails clean this up i recognize that some of the presidents critics have attempted to construct some type of conspiracy about the communication between the president and the secretary of state he said
he continued but theyve failed to put forward a conspiracy that withstands any scrutiny so i guess they are back to recycling thoroughly debunked conspiracies
obama himself denied any knowledge of the server telling cbs reporter bill plante in march  just after the server revelations that he learned of the clintons private email server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports
 
several days after the server revelations in march  earnest told the press that obama knew about clintons email address and had sent messages to it but knew nothing about a private server
he reiterated that position on tuesday
the president did trade emails with secretary clinton not a large number of them earnest said
of course the president had possession of secretary clintons email address but he did not have any knowledge of where her server was located or what sort of arrangements had been made to store her email
 
trending stories frustrated with media bias trump campaign takes its case directly to voters with nightly show on facebook independent voters push trump to the front in florida and ohio rnc official takes cnn host to task for claiming there is no media bias however the wikileaks email chain  which earnest referred to as stolen and therefore illegitimate  tells a different story with top clinton aides seemingly in a panic that it could come to light that the president was lying when he said he did not know about clintons private server

1278,no title,"while democrats perpetually circle the wagons republicans engage a perpetual circular firing squad the same holds true for many evangelicals democrats and secularists count on it 
and we never disappoint 
full disclosure i went from a dogged never trumper to a maybe trumper and finally settled as a reluctant trumper i like any godfearing father of daughters was and remain appalled by donald trumps sordid past and his yearold vulgar video in which he objectified women his words are indefensible and i fully expect the clinton camp to strategically release additional revolting and embarrassing opposition research about the republican nominee before election day 
still i will be voting against hillary clinton on nov  in what is objectively and irrefutably the most effective way possible by casting a vote for better or worse for the policies and promises of donald trump  and for the vice presidency of gov mike pence 
regrettably with many of my never trump friends im reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself and others of the strength of his own faith pride is an awful thing we are to be wise as serpents and innocent as doves matthew  foolishness called faith is just foolishness 
even so there are christian pharisees on both extremes of this trump fiasco first those trumpian cultists who buy the make america great again pablum and deride any person who while not casting judgment upon others makes with all sincerity what they view as the principled decision the latter say theyll sit this one out or go through the motions by voting third party  a wasted vote by any objective standard while i appreciate this milder strain of never trumpers sincerity i nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong 
and then there are the selfrighteous plankintheeye never trump prigs who slander as having lost their saltinesssinned against god and compromised their principles brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed lord knows im the worst sinner of all baby christian as president is a vote against hillary clintons tyranny in perpetuity 
the media research center has done america a tremendous service in  the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion  something hillary clinton stood on stage during the final presidential debate stared into the camera with cold callous eyes and then both lied about and defended unequivocally i plead with never trumpers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for nov  
mrs clintons beloved lateterm abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the leftleaning american medical association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances not the least of which is for the life or health of the mother 
during a partialbirth abortion the abortionist pulls a fully viable child  often kicking and thrashing  feet first from her mothers womb leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal this is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion rather than committing murder 
he then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt next he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains thereby collapsing her skull 
her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage 
this is homicide plain and simple hillary clinton supports it donald trump opposes it 
we deserve gods wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch in my estimation mrs clinton is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity her supreme court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner 
my conscience tells me that i must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against mrs clinton and ensure that she is stopped she must not be elected president to not vote  or to vote for a nonstarter third party candidate which is effectively the same thing  while not an actual vote for mrs clinton still puts this mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the white house and the supreme court 
its simple math and its undeniable the most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against mrs clinton by voting for mr trump this does the most electoral damage possible to candidate clinton and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations 
with its  roe v wade decision the us supreme court put the governments official stamp of approval on mass murder since then the battle lines have been drawn this is war prochoicers are the bad guys and prolifers the good guys it really is that simple  that black and white its good versus evil 
history will reflect as much 
under a president hillary clinton millions more babies will be tortured and dismembered alive under a president donald trump these millions might live and yet even as hillary sharpens her knives we quibble like fools over donalds potty mouth

1279,no title,"election crossroads socialism or capitalism exclusive jane chastain explains impact of dems living wage proposal published  mins ago jane chastain about   archive jane chastain is a southern californiabased broadcaster author and political commentator despite her present emphasis on politics jane always will be remembered as the nations first female tv sportscaster spending  years on the sports beat jane blogs at janechastaincom she is a pilot who lives on a private runway print 
our country is at a crossroads never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road one road the one favored by politician hillary clinton and her democratic colleagues promises to lead us to a socialist utopia the other favored by businessman donald trump and some of his republican colleagues promises to get us back on the road toward freemarket capitalism 
it is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system in this system they control the lions share of our money and in turn hand out favors in this system they make the major decisions that affect our lives as the government accumulates more and more power we invariably end up with less statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power the more of our hardearned money he or she spends yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again expecting a different result 
weve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the freemarket system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world no it isnt perfect but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life 
notice what i didnt say is simply willing to work hard there is the belief by some that if you simply work hard you should have what these politicians now call a living wage  the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs which is around  a year in some parts of the country the democrats want to replace the minimum wage which is a training wage with this living wage that completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently 
ideally it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does 
unfortunately this socalled living wage will destroy jobs it will cause companies to automate and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate 
but this living wage is only part of what the democrats want to do in the name of fairness 
this no doubt appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better 
wages have remained flat for far too long but the democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators 
most people simply do not understand that businesses dont pay taxes they are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices and when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high such as weve seen in obamacare there is a large outcry thats when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services thats when the door to socialismcommunism slams shut 
they tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear our benevolent government will take care of us they are offering us free college  or almost free loans  in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve and if we dont get that job the government is going to give us free health care free food and free housing under president hillary there will be free child care free preschool and paid family leave what a country 
if we dont reach our goals everything will be ok because social security and medicare will be there to finance our retirement and if that isnt enough the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television 
what about the fact that social security and medicare are going broke how long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses they never talk about that 
as british prime minister margaret thatcher once said the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples money 
dont be fooled this election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket its an important fork in the road one fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom the other offers a free lunch

1280,no title,"print 
before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out allow me to explain my decision to vote for donald trump on nov  
first im writing this because i have been asked incessantly for months how i would be voting not because i think im someone special or that what i do should influence you 
second im not endorsing donald trump in my mind theres a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate 
third i respect those in the nevertrump camp and share many of their concerns including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies just to name a few among the nevertrump voices i respect are columnists like david french and ben shapiro bloggers like matt walsh and evangelical leaders like russell moore and beth moore 
fourth i take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over trump as if he were some kind of savior figure supporting him as if he were st donald i also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of trumps failings constantly saying let him who is without sin cast the first one see john  this is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation 
fifth my decision to vote for trump barring something earthshattering between now and nov  is consistent with my position which has been  during the gop primaries i issued strong warnings against voting for trump while we had other excellent choices i did this in writing  on video and on the radio but always stating that if trump won the nomination i would reevaluate my position  once trump became the republican candidate i wrote that i was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote  i have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would i vote for hillary for two strong warnings about hillary see here and here  
so what has convinced me that i should now vote for donald trump 
the culture war is not over gain hope courage and practical advice in michael browns latest book outlasting the gay revolution where homosexual activism is really going and how to turn the tide 
first i believe that he actually is serious about appointing prolife proconstitution supreme court justices when he said during the last debate that if youre prolife you want to see roe v wade overturned and when he reiterated at his gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of  potential appointees he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flipflop if elected 
second one reason i endorsed sen ted cruz was because he took on the political establishment both democratic and republican to the point of calling it the washington cartel trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system although unfortunately hes been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system so my vote for him is also a protest vote 
third i am voting for the republican platform not the republican party which means im in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole 
fourth while i have always felt that the line were electing a president not a pastor was overstated and superficial if we rephrased it to say were electing a general to train handtohand combat warriors not a pastor it might have more relevance in other words we are not looking for trump to be a moral reformer even if hedoes appoint righteous judges and at this point he certainly is anything but a moral example although we pray he will be truly converted and become one rather out of our choices for president which are stark we are voting for the one most likely to defeat hillary and make some good decisions for the nation not be the savior and with things so messed up in america the handtohand combat analogy is closer to home 
fifth within the first few minutes of the last debate the massive differences between hillary and trump were there for the world to see she a proabortion radical and an extreme supporter of the lgbt agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against lateterm abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties since i have the opportunity to vote i feel that i should vote for trump 
sixth trump continues to be drawn to conservative christians and not just ones who tickle his ears one of my dear friends has spent hours with trump and members of his family and he has told me that in  years of ministry no one has received him as openly and graciously as has trump yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms while i am not one of those claiming that trump is a bornagain christian i see absolutely no evidence of this the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on it also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president 
seventh although im quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation im far more concerned with what we as gods people do with our own lives and witnesses and for me the state of the church of america is much more important than the state of the white house in that context i echo the words and warning of dr martin luther king jr the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state but rather the conscience of the state it must be the guide and the critic of the state and never its tool if the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority 
so in sum  my hope is in god not donald trump and i do recognize that either hillary or trump has the potential to do great harm to america  my urgent call is for us as followers of jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation  i will continue to urge all believers not to vote for hillary clinton whose policies will certainly do us great harm and  ultimately the most effective way to defeat hillary is to vote for trump while also praying that god will use him for good  not for evil 
in the end if trump gets elected and fails miserably i will be grieved but not devastated if he does well i will rejoice 
either way though my vote is just that a vote my greater role is to live a life pleasing to god with the hope of advancing a gospelbased moral and cultural revolution receive michael browns commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for michael browns alerts you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email name",2016-10-26

explaining latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape criminal justice researcher shana maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household and women are subordinate to men  hispanics and latinos are more likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim the victim not the perpetrator is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family 
one american detective said that today police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing 
when it comes to multiculturalism you cant say we love the empanadas  but we dont want yearold men raping their nieces  this isnt an a la carte menu we get all the attributes of the cultures were importing 
as described in excruciating detail in adios america the lefts plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants 
thus for example where i would have chosen the headline illegal alien convicted of incest child rape the chattanooga tenn times free press went with the less catchy man guilty in case of human smuggling 
and where i would have used the headline illegal alien repeatedly raped yearold girl at job site the commercial dispatch in columbus mississippi went with the more subtle columbus resident charged with molestation 
immigrant women arrive in america thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape incest and spousal murder are acceptable only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled 
in  brooklyn judge edward pincus sentenced a chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood the female head of the asianamerican legal defense and education fund margaret fung applauded the ruling 
somewhat amazingly newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime anything to keep the third world immigration flowing 
in  a yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens who cheered and videoed the attack 
when the news first broke shaneequa jupiter who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger that could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants 
even if shaneequa had scoured the headlines she would have been on the lookout for austin men or two 
compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack 
 two held in attack on child  austin americanstatesman texas july   
 two mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  daily mail online july   
needless to say the new york times did not cover the mexican illegalalien gang rape at all 
the ultimate primer on the bluecollar billionaire order ann coulters book in trump we trust e pluribus awesome 
by contrast the times and every major american news outlet extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age at about the same time in about the same place 
the second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was  but she was an enthusiastic participant sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex 
those rapes just a few years earlier got a fullcourt press the defendants were africanamerican the victim was mexican 
that time there were articles in the huffington post gq slate salon and mother jones it even made the new york times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team 
similarly within a few months of one another in  two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur alabama for assaults on yearold girls one suspect was africanamerican the other was a hispanic immigrant only one made the newspaper guess which one 
when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of hillarys foreign policy successes journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men 
conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and colleagues definitely not islam 
sampling of new york times commentary on logans rape 
 why we need women in war zones i would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened  this attack also had nothing to do with islam 
 reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not  in my experience muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment 
perhaps american men could do better but as american women may soon discover they never had it so good 
manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america they are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the democrats and cheap labor to the rich the chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife for example came to america based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher 
our country will be zimbabwe but  if all goes according to the democrats plan  theyll get to be mugabe

two weeks left to go in the election and the electorate feels like a battered nfl fan the game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage 
democrats can be counted upon to call the republican opponent racist whether the opponent is the priestly mitt romney or the supreme court justice who wrote the dred scott decision donald trump you see is racist because among other reasons at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him my africanamerican hillary clinton on the other hand is not antisemitic even though three witnesses one of whom took and passed a polygraph claim that she referred to her husbands former congressional campaign manager as a fing jew bastard 
with a republican candidate the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies  big or small real or imagined  while giving the democrat a pass so trumps failure to ever apologize outweighs an examination of clintons flatout lie during the third debate when she insisted that the supreme court heller case was about toddlers as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the second amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms 
in heller nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word toddler appear clinton a year ago flatout said the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment to normal people this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on which again was whether we as individuals have a right to keep and bear arms 
meanwhile we learn more and more about what the media labels an email scandal when the accurate description is national security scandal the espionage act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters the law does not require as fbi director james comey falsely stated an intent nor is it relevant as clinton insists whether or not her private server the one she maintained in her basement was hacked 
five people who worked with or for clinton including her chief of staff all received immunity deals something normally given to get someone to flip on a target some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed but the target that is to say hillary clinton was deemed by comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted so why the immunity deals who knows  and as far as most of the media are concerned who cares 
clinton insists that president obama doesnt get enough credit for the swell job he did with the economy this would be the economy in which for the first time in history a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least  percent growth in gross domestic product this would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that gallup ceo jim clifton calls the big lie given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are underemployed 
meanwhile its yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed groped touched or made fun of by trump has appeared with her attorney feminist gloria allred allred a clinton supporter sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of trumps sexual misconduct and her support for clinton who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husbands accusers one such accuser juanita broaddrick claims not only that she was raped by bill clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape hillary clinton verbally threatened her 
hillary clinton mind you has never been asked by anyone in the media about broaddricks allegation never and only one national reporter sam donaldson has ever asked bill clinton about juanita broaddricks allegation ever clintons answer he referred donaldson to his lawyer david kendall donaldson quickly tried again asking the thenpresident to simply deny it same answer my attorney  speaks for me and that was that 
so hillary clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy thats given us the worst recovery since  who has clearly violated the espionage act and placed the nations security at risk who told the benghazi victims families that the death of four americans was inspired by a video while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different whose charitable foundation engaged in paytoplay in haiti so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and nondonors went to the back of the line who wants to gut the second amendment who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of isis russia and the chinese and whose media compadres including scribes with the new york times washington post and cnbc have been outed by wikileaks as colluding with her campaign and she is now oddson favorite to become the next president of the united states receive larry elders commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for larry elders alerts you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email name",2016-10-29

national review  what was the legal rationale under which hillary clinton quite intentionally shared classified information with her lawyers including david kendall cheryl mills and heather samuelson 
as i outlined in last weekends column we know that clintons emails were replete with classified information according to the fbi the classified emails included intelligence graded at the most closely guarded level eight topsecret emails and seven designated as special access program sap information while fbi director james comeys presentation understandably left this vague the likelihood is that seven of the eight topsecret emails are sap under president bill clintons  executive order topsecret intelligence is information the mishandling of which could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security the sap designation is added when the unauthorized disclosure of intelligence could compromise critical intelligencegathering methods or imperil the lives of intelligence sources 
that is why access to this information is so tightly restricted and its unauthorized disclosure is routinely prosecuted",2016-11-03

new york youtube on wednesday suspended the account of danney williams the yearold who has claimed since the s to be the black son of former president bill clinton 
youtube citing repeated or severe violations of our terms of use andor community guidelines declared the account cannot be restored 
the youtube decision blocked the nineminute feature banished  the untold story of danney williams which had received  million views since williams posted it last week produced by filmmaker joel gilbert it drew nearly  views per day and more than  viewer comments with the overwhelming majority expressing support for williams and outrage at the clintons for not being willing to allow a dna test to determine paternity 
like the reporting you see here sign up for free news alerts from wndcom americas independent news network 
my youtube account has been deleted but the same video appears in  other places on youtube alone williams said on his facebook page after being notified of youtubes decision youtube cant handle the truth please share billclintonson 
twitter also continues to allow williams to post the banished video on danney williams page  but the twitter link to youtube displays the message  this video is no longer available because the youtube account associated with this video has been terminated sorry about that 
the video is still running on danney williamsclintons facebook page  as well as on the youtube channel operated by gilbert 
attempt to silence danney williams 
gilbert told wnd he helped williams file an online appeal form on youtube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated 
the behavior of youtubegoogle in suspending danneys account is outrageous there have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any youtube terms or guidelines gilbert said 
gilbert was outspoken in charging youtube with partisan political motives for the suspension 
the only possible explanation is that the clinton campaign requested youtubegoogle to silence danney to run him off the plantation as danney said hillary clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the arkansas governors mansion in  gilbert said 
danney cannot be silenced any longer he continued hillary may try to sweep danney williams under the rug but its not going to work this time his story is out there and every day more and more people understand bill and hillary clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin 
see the danney williams video feature 
wnd reported oct  that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate attorneys for williams were in las vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding dna evidence from the former president 
accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating williams that went viral on the internet 
no definitive dna test 
wnd reported that no dna test was conducted in  despite media reports to the contrary when williams claim first surfaced 
clinton defenders since  have contended the tabloid star magazine conducted a dna showdown proving bill clinton was not williams father citing star magazine editor phil bunton saying at the time there was no match nothing even close 
but in an interview bunton told wnd that no blood sample was obtained from clinton and star magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test 
i dont remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on clintons dna bunton told wnd 
bunton is now the owner of the rivertown magazine in haverstraw new york 
he affirmed to wnd that the tabloid relied on the dna evidence for clinton published by independent counsel kenneth starr extracted from the infamous monica lewinsky blue dress 
we got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media including the new york times wanting to know when we were going to get the dna back bunton recalled to wnd we thought it was going to turn out to be his son but when the dna came back there was no story there even to write 
the dna test released by kenneth starr was the second of two dna laboratory tests the fbi had run on clinton but the public record leaves no doubt that starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the fbi

many other figures who have challenged the democratic party or the leftleaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets including james okeefe and his project veritas which has exposed clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hiddencamera videos just as okeefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud oct  twitter shut down his account  claiming violations of twitter rules the notice said he must delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules which prohibit harassing other users threatening other users disclosing other users private information or violating other rules in a statement okeefe said he relies on social media to bypass the media and directly reach the public on monday okeefe wrote in a tweet project veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to youtube calling the apparent block bizarre earlier this month okeefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a hillary clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day his account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hiddencamera video that exposed a clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns the daily caller reported  project veritas posted an undercover video oct  proving hillary clinton supporters were inciting violence at donald trump rallies to gain negative media coverage millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours but it didnt show up on googles trending list on youtube which google owns noted silenceisconsentnet  it did however trend on twitter which google does not own breitbart blogger milo yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by twitter minutes before his gays for trump party at the republican national convention for some  months the makers of the new movie im not ashamed about the first victim of the columbine killers in colorado in  were unable to promote their movie through youtube the trailer was taken down late in  and the movies entire channel was suspended

1286,national attention on ayotte  hassan nh senate race,"print 
have you ever noticed how washington always has a plan to solve everybodys problem  except their own 
for the federal government its always easy and tempting to look at problems  real or imagined  outside of the beltway and solve them from afar 
you will recall of course how former attorney general eric holder was going to stop police shootings all over america with sensitivity training the power and force of the federal government and investigations investigations and more investigations 
now loretta lynch his successor also known as hillary clintons guardian angel is set to turn police shootings throughout america into big business and more power for washington 
her latest pet project is assembling a national database on interactions between law enforcement and civilians she reported this month 
accurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about communitypolice relations lynch said in the days ahead the department of justice will continue to work alongside our local state tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive useful and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve 
the irony here is thick indeed 
one of lynchs goals she says is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them 
meanwhile lynch presides over the most egregious coverup of the most outrageous police shooting case i have ever seen in my life  namely the killing of miriam carey a young black mother with baby in tow who was gunned down by washington cops and secret service agents for a wrong turn in the nations capital 
lynch wants reports 
so does wnd which has been pursuing the information through freedom of information act requests and finally after being stonewalled for years a lawsuit 
so does the public and the family of miriam carey unfortunately lynch is holding back on a few things missing evidence the page memo with findings analysis of evidence and conclusions in the carey shooting investigation this would show the evidence and reasoning that led the department of justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers why they considered this a justifiable homicide  or whether they should have based on the evidence why officers used deadly force whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies video of shooting at capitol police guard post at intersection of constitution ave maryland ave and nd street only stills have been released video would show more clearly if officers life actually was in danger as doj claimed when he fired fatal shot to careys head not one of the five witnesses at the scene said carey was driving at the officer as the doj claimed police statements the police report said four officers fired shots at carey two from the capitol police and two from the secret service not one statement from those officers was in the report their names were also redacted redacted information an attorney in the washington dc mayors office said the only redactions were names in order to protect privacy it turned out much more was redacted than names the report was riddled with blackedout sections and missing information  pages in the report were entirely blacked out  pages were mostly blacked out  pages were partially blacked out some of the blackedout pages just included a heading marked evidence some just had a date witness statements an astonishing  witness accounts are missing from the police report the police report stated there were seventytwo  witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio andor video recordings copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the usao for review copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the technical support unit tsu located at the iad of those  witness statements only  were in the materials provided to wnd leaving  missing statement transcripts none of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses own words were provided just paraphrased versions in what the former nypd officer sanders described as cop talk white house guard post video stills were released but not the video it would show whether anyone was manning the post when carey drove up whether she tried to drive around the offduty guard who dragged a gate in front of her and whether she sped off or left at a normal speed as a witness said police radio recordings no recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of carey were provided in the foia material also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions instant messaging between squad cars and police headquarters ballistics and forensics reports the justice department washington metro police department responses to foia requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report 
i could go on and on for people who want facts and reports the us justice department under both holder and lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press 
weve been at this for a long time  years yet the stonewall and coverup of a horrendous unjustifiable outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues 
do we really expect eric holder and loretta lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that

 i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy for me that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community that will stand up and say no to citizens united a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system  
 hillary clinton 
the first salvo from democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton or rather her answer to the first question posed by fox news chris wallace to her and donald trump at the third presidential debate was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy 
those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing dog whistle politics rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition ms clintons response to wallaces question where they wanted to see the supreme court take the country and their views on how the constitution ought to be interpreted however was representative of this tactic 
while womens rights and those of the lgbt community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court since objectively women wouldnt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president and the lgbt community accounts for less than  percent of the american population clintons answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress 
womens rights is of course dog whistle for unfettered abortion even lateterm abortion which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment lgbt rights is dog whistle for disenfranchising the majority of americans who hold traditional values primarily christians leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of christians in europe and canada a direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the us at least not at present however judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result 
let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the constitution and that clintons overall objectives are manifestly evil hillary clintons stated priorities for the supreme court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the constitution and individual liberties rather than allowing it to perform its designated function the hypocrisy attendant to clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see despite being conveniently ignored by the press 
clintons reference to powerful corporations and the wealthy and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization citizens united was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy clinton is quite wealthy and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of american socialists even if citizens united were a vehicle for dark unaccountable money the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the muslim brotherhood with which bill and hillary clinton have been partnered for decades or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by george soros the former nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in america someone with whom the clintons also have a long association 
one need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind clintons debate rhetoric to discern what a hillary clinton presidency might look like her actions to date  and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office  should suffice quite nicely despite the craven complicity of the establishment press mainstream media there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the democratic leviathan supporting her and which facilitated barack obamas rise to power are fundamentally malignant 
in recent days weve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality thats been brought to bear in getting clinton elected from democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of clintons popularity to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the clinton campaign the democratic national committee and the white house 
the bottom line here is that hillary clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality what all americans  not just voters and not just republicans  need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the republican party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the democratic party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and yes even vote for their candidates 
the burning question is this in the end are we to be governed by the will of the people or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government

1289,snow reports from around the northland duluth through  am saturday,"while democrats perpetually circle the wagons republicans engage a perpetual circular firing squad the same holds true for many evangelicals democrats and secularists count on it 
and we never disappoint 
full disclosure i went from a dogged never trumper to a maybe trumper and finally settled as a reluctant trumper i like any godfearing father of daughters was and remain appalled by donald trumps sordid past and his yearold vulgar video in which he objectified women his words are indefensible and i fully expect the clinton camp to strategically release additional revolting and embarrassing opposition research about the republican nominee before election day 
still i will be voting against hillary clinton on nov  in what is objectively and irrefutably the most effective way possible by casting a vote for better or worse for the policies and promises of donald trump  and for the vice presidency of gov mike pence 
regrettably with many of my never trump friends im reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself and others of the strength of his own faith pride is an awful thing we are to be wise as serpents and innocent as doves matthew  foolishness called faith is just foolishness 
even so there are christian pharisees on both extremes of this trump fiasco first those trumpian cultists who buy the make america great again pablum and deride any person who while not casting judgment upon others makes with all sincerity what they view as the principled decision the latter say theyll sit this one out or go through the motions by voting third party  a wasted vote by any objective standard while i appreciate this milder strain of never trumpers sincerity i nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong 
and then there are the selfrighteous plankintheeye never trump prigs who slander as having lost their saltinesssinned against god and compromised their principles brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed lord knows im the worst sinner of all baby christian as president is a vote against hillary clintons tyranny in perpetuity 
the media research center has done america a tremendous service in  the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion  something hillary clinton stood on stage during the final presidential debate stared into the camera with cold callous eyes and then both lied about and defended unequivocally i plead with never trumpers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for nov  
mrs clintons beloved lateterm abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the leftleaning american medical association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances not the least of which is for the life or health of the mother 
during a partialbirth abortion the abortionist pulls a fully viable child  often kicking and thrashing  feet first from her mothers womb leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal this is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion rather than committing murder 
he then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt next he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains thereby collapsing her skull 
her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage 
this is homicide plain and simple hillary clinton supports it donald trump opposes it 
we deserve gods wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch in my estimation mrs clinton is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity her supreme court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner 
my conscience tells me that i must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against mrs clinton and ensure that she is stopped she must not be elected president to not vote  or to vote for a nonstarter third party candidate which is effectively the same thing  while not an actual vote for mrs clinton still puts this mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the white house and the supreme court 
its simple math and its undeniable the most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against mrs clinton by voting for mr trump this does the most electoral damage possible to candidate clinton and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations 
with its  roe v wade decision the us supreme court put the governments official stamp of approval on mass murder since then the battle lines have been drawn this is war prochoicers are the bad guys and prolifers the good guys it really is that simple  that black and white its good versus evil 
history will reflect as much 
under a president hillary clinton millions more babies will be tortured and dismembered alive under a president donald trump these millions might live and yet even as hillary sharpens her knives we quibble like fools over donalds potty mouth 
the devil and democrats oh how they love derision and division within the body of christ",2016-11-19
