español ??????? ???? ?? coopération entre lorganisation des nations unies et les organisations régionales et sousrégionales aux fins du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales organisation du traité de sécurité collective organisation de shanghai pour la coopération et communauté détats indépendants la fédération de russie compte organiser le octobre un débat sur le thème coopération entre lorganisation des nations unies et les organisations régionales et sousrégionales aux fins du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales organisation du traité de sécurité collective organisation de shanghai pour la coopération et communauté détats indépendants qui constituera un évènement phare de sa présidence au conseil de sécurité au vu de la dimension mondiale des problèmes et menaces actuels et de la nécessité délaborer des stratégies collectives pour les combattre efficacement il est essentiel de renforcer la coopération entre lonu et les organisations régionales et sousrégionales dans le domaine du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité pour ce qui est de lonu il sagit avant tout de tirer parti de son caractère universel aussi bien au niveau de ses membres que de ses activités ainsi que de sa légitimité mondialement reconnue les organisations régionales quant à elles connaissent souvent mieux la situation dans les régions relevant de leur compétence et dans de nombreux cas sont dotées de mécanismes de prévention et de maintien de la paix adaptés aux réalités locales il importe à cet égard que les activités des organisations régionales tendent à trouver des solutions pacifiques et politiques aux conflits émergents dans ce contexte il est particulièrement important que lonu et ses principaux partenaires régionaux se coordonnent régulièrement sur les questions ayant trait au maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales ainsi le conseil de sécurité tient régulièrement des séances sur la coopération avec lunion africaine lorganisation pour la sécurité et la coopération en europe et lunion européenne ces dernières années un examen également été mené sur la coopération avec la ligue des états arabes lassociation des nations de lasie du sudest lunion des nations de lamérique du sud et dautres organisations régionales comme le sait la collaboration entre lonu et ses partenaires régionaux couvre un nombre toujours plus grand de questions aux activités de maintien et de consolidation de la paix sont venues sajouter la lutte contre la prolifération des armes de destruction massive et le trafic darmes légères et de petit calibre ainsi que la lutte contre le cyberterrorisme et la migration illégale domaines dans lesquels la coopération entre les organisations concernées et lonu est de plus en plus étroite cette coopération joue un rôle essentiel dans le maintien de la paix et de la stabilité à léchelle de leurasie et plus particulièrement en asie centrale cest précisément dans ce domaine quuvrent trois organisations relativement jeunes dans une vaste zone sétendant de leurope orientale à lextrêmeorient à savoir lorganisation du traité de sécurité collective otsc lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopération et la communauté détats indépendants cei de plus en plus influentes sur la scène politique mondiale ces organisations contribuent considérablement au renforcement de la sécurité régionale et internationale le débat sera axé sur le rôle de ces trois organisations dans la lutte contre les menaces qui pèsent sur la paix et la sécurité dans la région notamment le terrorisme le trafic de drogues et la criminalité organisée il permettra également à ces organisations de réaffirmer leur volonté de renforcer la coopération sur le plan pratique avec lonu notamment avec son centre régional pour la diplomatie préventive en asie centrale lotsc est une structure pluridimensionnelle à même de réagir résolument aux divers problèmes et menaces actuels auxquels peuvent faire face ses états membres à cet égard le resserrement de la coopération entre lonu est lotsc dans le domaine du maintien de la paix est prometteur lotsc déploie dimportants efforts pour renforcer ses propres capacités de maintien de la paix qui pourront aussi être mises à la disposition des opérations de maintien de la paix des nations unies elle contribue activement en outre aux actions menées sur le plan international pour reconstruire lafghanistan après le conflit et pour écarter la menace que représentent les stupéfiants provenant de ce pays ses relations avec lonu se révèlent fructueuses dans de nombreux domaines comme la lutte contre le terrorisme et le trafic de drogues le maintien de la paix ou la lutte contre la criminalité organisée lotsc entretient et développe des rapports productifs avec les entités spécialisées de lonu notamment le comité contre le terrorisme du conseil de sécurité et loffice des nations unies contre la drogue et le crime tous les deux ans lassemblée générale adopte une résolution sur la coopération entre lonu et lotsc et il est prévu quelle en adopte une à sa soixante et onzième session au titre du point de lordre du jour intitulé coopération entre lorganisation des nations unies et les organisations régionales ou autres les fondements juridiques de la coopération entre lonu et lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopération dans le domaine du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales au titre du chapitre viii de la charte des nations unies ont été posés à la suite de la signature en de la déclaration conjointe sur la coopération entre les secrétariats des deux organisations actuellement lorganisation de shanghai et lonu collaborent étroitement dans des domaines tels que la prévention et le règlement des conflits la lutte contre le terrorisme linstance régionale de lutte contre le terrorisme relevant de lorganisation de shanghai uvre à cette fin la nonprolifération des armes de destruction massive la lutte contre la criminalité transnationale et le trafic de drogues et la sécurité informatique internationale dans ce contexte lorganisation de shanghai appuie activement les efforts déployés par la communauté internationale et les organismes des nations unies pour rétablir la paix en afghanistan se prononçant toujours en faveur du maintien du rôle central de coordination de lonu dans le règlement du conflit afghan quant à la cei la sécurité et la lutte contre les menaces actuelles ont toujours été et demeurent un des domaines prioritaires de coopération entre ses états membres une coopération constructive avec les organisations internationales est également essentielle pour contrer les menaces émergentes les pays de la cei sont parties à tous les principaux instruments internationaux régissant la coopération dans les domaines de la sécurité du désarmement et de la lutte contre les menaces actuelles et contribuent efficacement à leur mise en uvre des mesures conjointes sont prises compte tenu du rôle moteur de lonu et de la nécessité détablir des partenariats constructifs avec dautres institutions internationales et leurs entités spécialisées comme le comité contre le terrorisme loffice des nations unies contre la drogue et le crime lorganisation internationale de police criminelle interpol lorganisation internationale pour les migrations le hautcommissariat des nations unies pour les réfugiés et le groupe daction financière sur le blanchiment des capitaux lélargissement et le renforcement de la coopération entre lonu et lotsc lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopération et la cei au titre du chapitre viii de la charte des nations unies semble contribuer de manière constructive à la réalisation des objectifs de lonu compris à lélimination des menaces et problèmes actuels dune part ces organisations régionales doivent activement envisager de mettre leurs capacités au service de lonu et dautre part lonu doit continuer daccorder lattention voulue au renforcement de la coordination et de la coopération avec ces organisations dans le strict respect de ses propres prérogatives et de celles de son conseil de sécurité dans ce contexte nous invitons les états membres de lonu à exposer leurs idées sur les moyens de renforcer la sécurité dans la région eurasienne avec laide des mécanismes régionaux existants force est de constater que la stabilité de cette vaste région est une condition sine qua non de la croissance économique et de lédification de létat des pays de leurasie et nous serions par conséquent reconnaissants aux délégations de nous faire part de leurs vues notamment en ce qui concerne les liens entre sécurité et développement nous sommes convaincus quici dans le cadre de lonu qui jouit dune légitimité universelle nous serons tous ensemble en mesure de proposer des stratégies novatrices visant la stabilisation des régions vulnérables susceptibles par la suite dêtre mises en uvre dans dautres régions du monde qui sont au centre des préoccupations du conseil de sécurité le secrétaire général de lonu ban kimoon le secrétaire général de lotsc nikolaï bordiouja le secrétaire général de

1227,penalty treason video,los brics plantan cara la guerra financiera de estados unidos por ariel noyola rodríguez para hacer frente la guerra financiera de estados unidos es urgente que los brics fortalezcan sus vínculos de cooperación en los ámbitos de la economía las finanzas el nuevo banco de desarrollo de los brics debe aumentar su volumen de créditos lo mismo el acuerdo contingente de reservas adicionalmente los brics deben poner en marcha lo más pronto posible su propia agencia de calificación para intensificar su cohesión económica la implementación de un área de libre comercio echaría abajo las barreras arancelarias con ello incrementaría sustancialmente los intercambios comerciales entre ellos en definitiva si se toman cuanto antes las medidas pertinentes los brics corren el riesgo de naufragar durante el próximo huracán financiero red voltaire ciudad de méxico méxico de octubre de français ??????? italiano el de octubre se llevó cabo en el estado de goa india la octava cumbre de los brics acrónimo de brasil rusia india china sudáfrica hay que reconocer que el encuentro se desarrolló en medio de una situación profundamente crítica para la economía mundial sin embargo los brics pusieron de manifiesto una vez más su extraordinaria capacidad para transformar un mal momento en una oportunidad para profundizar los vínculos entre ellos desde una perspectiva estratégica después de que las economías de los brics gozaran de una época dorada en los últimos años sus tasas de crecimiento han sufrido una drástica desaceleración frente esta difícil coyuntura hoy más que nunca los brics necesitan echar mano de las instituciones financieras que presentaron ante el mundo hace un par de años en fortaleza brasil durante su sexta cumbre en abril pasado su nuevo banco de desarrollo realizó sus primeros préstamos por más de millones de dólares para se calcula que los créditos otorgados podrían alcanzar los millones de dólares asimismo esta entidad financiera llevó cabo en julio de este año una histórica emisión de bonos verdes green bonds en yuanes por un monto equivalente millones de dólares estos títulos financieros la vez que incrementan la influencia de la moneda china escala mundial sirven para el financiamiento de grandes proyectos de inversión por su parte el acuerdo contingente de reservas cra por sus siglas en inglés dotado de millones de dólares ya está listo para otorgar sus primeras líneas de crédito con el objetivo de estabilizar las balanzas de pagos de los brics según anunció el ministro de finanzas de la india arun jaitley toda vez que la reserva federal fed de estados unidos amaga permanentemente con subir la tasa de interés de los fondos federales federal funds rate con ello detonar una nueva turbulencia financiera mundial urge que los brics incrementen cuanto antes los recursos monetarios de su fondo de estabilización pues de lo contrario corren el riesgo de padecer serios estragos por las apuestas especulativas de los grandes bancos de inversiones de forma simultánea los brics necesitan abrir nuevos frentes de batalla que desafíen de modo abierto la hegemonía de estados unidos el dólar en el sistema financiero mundial solamente través de los intercambios comerciales en monedas locales sino por ejemplo través de la acumulación de reservas en yuanes entre sus bancos centrales más todavía luego de que la moneda del pueblo renminbi en chino ingresó oficialmente el pasado º de octubre en los derechos especiales de giro special drawing rights la canasta de divisas de élite creada por el fondo monetario internacional fmi finales de la década de los por añadidura los brics tienen la capacidad de articular una gran alianza financiera con poderosos eslabonamientos geopolíticos entre américa latina asia áfrica el medio oriente los bancos regionales de desarrollo que están conformados en su mayoría por los países periféricos bien pueden servir este objetivo el banco asiático de inversiones en infraestructura aiib por sus siglas en inglés el banco del alba alianza bolivariana para los pueblos de nuestra américa e incluso el banco del sur que finalmente arrancará antes de que termine este año asimismo se ha vuelto una imperiosa exigencia para los brics la puesta en marcha de una agencia de calificación propia que rompa con el predominio aplastante que estados unidos mantiene través de fitch moodys standard poors estas tres agencias de calificación más que realizar evaluaciones que se guíen por criterios de tipo técnico actúan fundamentalmente bajo impulsos de carácter político esto es como auténticas máquinas de guerra degradan las notas de los bonos de deuda soberana con ello elevan dramáticamente los costos de financiamiento de países como grecia rusia venezuela la cohesión económica es otro de los grandes retos si bien es indudable que se ha venido intensificando de forma sustantiva durante los años recientes entre el comercio entre los brics como proporción de sus intercambios totales se duplicó del al china es por mucho la economía que está más integrada con los demás brics en contraste los vínculos entre países como la india sudáfrica son marginales lo mismo sucede entre brasil rusia por eso es muy pertinente la próxima implementación de un área de libre comercio entre los brics sin embargo además de echar abajo las barreras arancelarias entre ellos los brics necesitan promover la construcción de cadenas de valor de forma conjunta esto es integrar sus aparatos productivos para incentivar la industrialización de las economías menos aventajadas en conclusión son muchos los desafíos en el horizonte para estas cinco potencias emergentes estoy convencido de que en lo sucesivo el éxito de los brics dependerá de la capacidad que tengan para reinventarse de su creatividad para articular nuevas dimensiones de cooperación con vistas cumplir metas de más largo alcance frente la nueva guerra financiera que prepara estados unidos es momento de que los brics vuelvan la carga ariel noyola rodríguez fuente russia today rusia,2016-11-07
