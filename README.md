## Data cleaning
All the possible date time stamps throughout all the datasets were formatted into one equal. Unnecessary rows were removed from fake and real news dataset articles. We also formatted the text so that it would not contain any punctuation	or capital letters and etc. We also spilt the second dataset, where the articles were mixed up, into two separate datasets.
